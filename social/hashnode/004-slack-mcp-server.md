Slack is where work conversations happen. The problem is that those conversations are locked inside Slack — an agent can't search your channels, read a thread, or post an update without some kind of integration. Slack's official MCP server changes that. Launched in February 2026, it gives AI agents direct, structured access to your workspace through the Model Context Protocol.

This isn't a community wrapper or a bot token hack. It's Slack's own server, hosted at `mcp.slack.com`, using their first-party OAuth. Here's what it's actually like.

## What It Does

The Slack MCP server provides tools across four categories:

**Search:**
- Search messages across channels, filterable by date, user, and content type
- Search files shared in the workspace
- Find channels by name and description
- Look up users by name, email, or user ID (with partial matching)

**Messaging:**
- Send messages to any conversation — channels, DMs, group DMs
- Read complete message history from channels
- Retrieve full thread conversations
- Draft and preview formatted messages within the AI client

**Canvases:**
- Create and update rich, formatted documents (Slack's canvas feature)
- Export canvases as markdown

**Users:**
- Access complete user profiles, including custom fields and status

Unlike the older community `@modelcontextprotocol/server-slack` npm package (which uses a bot token and talks to Slack's regular API), the official server uses confidential OAuth and is purpose-built for LLM consumption.

## Setup

This is where the Slack MCP server diverges from most MCP servers. There's no `npx` command. No local process to run. The server is hosted by Slack.

**For supported clients (Claude.ai, Claude Code, Cursor, Perplexity):** These have built-in integration. In Claude Desktop, you add Slack as a remote MCP server pointing to `https://mcp.slack.com/mcp`. The client handles the OAuth flow — you authorize your Slack workspace, grant the scopes you're comfortable with, and you're connected.

**For custom clients:** You need to register a Slack app at api.slack.com, configure confidential OAuth with the right scopes, and handle the token exchange yourself. Your app must be published to the Slack Marketplace or registered as an internal app.

**Setup difficulty: Easy for supported clients, moderate for custom builds.**

## What Works Well

**Search is genuinely powerful.** Searching across an entire Slack workspace from within an AI conversation is a significant capability. "Find that thread where the team discussed the database migration last week" — that actually works. Date and user filters keep results focused.

**Granular privacy controls are done right.** Public channel search is the baseline, but accessing DMs or private channels requires explicit user consent through separate scopes. Admins can see and manage which MCP clients have access, with full audit logging.

**Natural language responses save context.** The server returns results formatted for LLM consumption, not raw API JSON. Less parsing overhead, fewer tokens wasted on structural data.

**No local server to manage.** The server runs at `mcp.slack.com`. No npm install, no Docker, no Node.js version drama. This is how hosted MCP servers should operate.

## What Doesn't Work Well

**The Marketplace requirement is a barrier for custom clients.** Your Slack app must be published to the Marketplace or registered as an internal app. You can't just create a quick app for personal use.

**No SSE support.** Streamable HTTP only. If your MCP client uses Server-Sent Events, it won't work.

**Message sending is powerful but risky.** An agent with `chat:write` can post to any channel. There's no "draft and confirm" gate in the MCP protocol itself. Use client-side approval prompts for any agent with write access.

**No reactions, no emoji, no scheduling.** You can read and send messages, but you can't add reactions, set reminders, or schedule messages.

## Compared to Alternatives

**vs. Community Slack MCP server (@modelcontextprotocol/server-slack):** Uses a bot token and runs locally. Simpler for personal use (no Marketplace requirement), but lacks granular OAuth scopes, natural language responses, and audit logging. Use the official server for team/production use.

**vs. korotovsky/slack-mcp-server:** No permission requirements, supports DMs, group DMs, and GovSlack. More permissive but less secure.

## Who Should Use This

**Yes, use it if:**
- Your team lives in Slack and you want your AI agent to search workspace knowledge
- You use a supported MCP client (Claude, Cursor, Perplexity) and want easy setup
- You need an agent to post updates, summaries, or reports to channels
- Workspace security and admin oversight are important to you

**Skip it if:**
- You just need a quick personal Slack bot (use the community server or a bot token)
- Your MCP client doesn't support Streamable HTTP transport
- You need reactions, scheduled messages, or other Slack features beyond search/send/canvases

## Verdict: 4/5 — The right way to give agents Slack access

The Slack MCP server is a solid first-party integration that gets the security model right. Granular OAuth scopes, admin oversight, audit logging, and natural language responses — Slack clearly thought about what "agent access to your workspace" should look like. The gaps are real (no reactions, no scheduling, Marketplace requirement for custom clients), but the core value — searching your workspace and posting messages from an AI agent — works well. If your team uses Slack and you're using a supported AI client, this is a straightforward install.
