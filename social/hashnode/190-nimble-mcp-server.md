Part of our **[Web Search & Data Extraction MCP category](https://chatforest.com/categories/web-search-scraping/)**.

**At a glance:** Closed-source (hosted only), no public GitHub repo, 7 tools, SSE transport, free trial (5,000 pages), pay-as-you-go from $1/1,000 pages, managed plans from $2,500/month. $47M Series B (February 2026).

Nimble (formerly Nimbleway) is an enterprise web data platform that raised [$47 million in Series B funding](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/nimble-way-raises-47m-to-give-ai-agents-better-cleaner-data/) in February 2026 to build AI agent infrastructure. Their MCP server connects to the same proxy and scraping backend used by enterprise customers, wrapping it in a standard MCP interface so agents can pull structured web data in real time.

The standout feature: Nimble is the only MCP server with dedicated **Google Maps intelligence tools** — business discovery, venue details (including real-time crowd levels), and structured review collection with sentiment analysis. If your agent needs local business data, this is currently the only MCP option that handles it natively.

The key question: at $2,500/month minimum for managed plans, is this justified when [Bright Data](https://chatforest.com/reviews/bright-data-mcp-server/) offers 60+ tools with a free tier, and [Firecrawl](https://chatforest.com/reviews/firecrawl-mcp-server/) handles general scraping at a fraction of the cost?

## What It Does

Nimble's MCP server exposes 7 tools across three categories:

### Web Search & Extraction

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **nimble_deep_web_search** | Real-time search across Google, Bing, Yandex with full content extraction from results |
| **nimble_extract** | Direct URL scraping — returns parsed content in multiple formats |

`deep_web_search` doesn't just return search results — it follows links and extracts the actual page content. This is a meaningful difference from SERP-only tools.

### E-commerce & Targeted Scraping

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **nimble_targeted_engines** | Discover available pre-trained scraping templates and supported platforms |
| **nimble_targeted_retrieval** | Extract products, prices, and availability from Amazon, Best Buy, Target, Walmart, and more |

The `targeted_engines` tool acts as a discovery layer — your agent can ask what platforms are supported before attempting to scrape. The `targeted_retrieval` tool returns structured JSON with product data, not raw HTML.

### Google Maps Intelligence

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **nimble_google_maps_search** | Business discovery at scale — find businesses by query and location, get ratings and metadata |
| **nimble_google_maps_place** | Deep venue data including real-time crowd levels, amenities, operating hours |
| **nimble_google_maps_reviews** | Structured review collection with ratings, sentiment, and reviewer data |

This is Nimble's unique differentiator. No other MCP server offers structured Google Maps extraction. For agents doing local business research, competitive analysis, or location intelligence, these three tools fill a real gap.

## Benchmark Performance

In [independent testing by AIMultiple](https://aimultiple.com/browser-mcp) across multiple MCP servers:

**Web Search & Extraction (single-agent):**

| Server | Accuracy | Avg Response Time |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| [Bright Data](https://chatforest.com/reviews/bright-data-mcp-server/) | 100% | 30s |
| **Nimble** | **93%** | **16s** |
| Firecrawl | 83% | 7s |
| Oxylabs | 75% | 14s |

Nimble ranked **second in accuracy** (93%) behind only Bright Data's perfect score. Response time was moderate at 16 seconds — faster than Bright Data but slower than Firecrawl.

**Stress Test (250 Concurrent Agents):**

| Server | Success Rate | Avg Completion Time |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| [Bright Data](https://chatforest.com/reviews/bright-data-mcp-server/) | 76.8% | 48.7s |
| Oxylabs | 54.4% | 31.7s |
| **Nimble** | **51.2%** | **182.3s** |
| Firecrawl | 64.8% | 77.6s |
| [Apify](https://chatforest.com/reviews/apify-mcp-server/) | 18.8% | — |

Here's where Nimble struggles. Under heavy concurrent load, success dropped to 51.2% (a 45% decline from single-agent accuracy), and successful tasks averaged **182.3 seconds** — nearly 4x slower than Oxylabs and almost 4x slower than Bright Data. If your use case involves many agents running simultaneously, this is a significant limitation.

## Setup

Nimble runs as a hosted service — no local installation required. Connect via SSE:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nimble": {
      "url": "https://mcp.nimbleway.com/sse",
      "headers": {
        "x-api-key": "YOUR_NIMBLE_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, qodo, Microsoft CoPilot, and OpenAI Playground. Framework integrations available for LangChain, LlamaIndex, Agno, and Microsoft AutoGen.

**No self-hosting option.** All requests route through Nimble's infrastructure. This simplifies setup but means you're dependent on their uptime, pricing, and data handling.

## Pricing

### Pay-as-You-Go

| API | Cost |
|-----|------|
| Agent API | $1 per 1,000 pages |
| Search API (search) | $1 per 1,000 search inputs |
| Search API (answer) | $4 per request |
| Extract (standard) | $0.90 per 1,000 URLs |
| Extract (JS render) | $1.30 per 1,000 URLs |
| Extract (stealth) | $1.45 per 1,000 URLs |
| Residential Proxy | $7.50 per GB |

### Managed Plans

| Plan | Price/month | Concurrent Agents | Monthly Credits | Data Storage |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Startup | $2,500 | 5 | 350K pages | 7 days |
| Scale | $7,000 | 10 | 1.2M pages | 30 days |
| Professional | $15,000 | 20 | 3M pages | 90 days |
| Enterprise | Custom | Unlimited | Custom | Custom |

All managed plans include MCP integration, custom agent ETL, and 15% discount on annual billing.

**Free trial:** 5,000 web pages to test before committing.

This is significantly more expensive than most alternatives. [Bright Data](https://chatforest.com/reviews/bright-data-mcp-server/) offers a free tier with 5,000 requests/month (ongoing, not just a trial). [Firecrawl](https://chatforest.com/reviews/firecrawl-mcp-server/) has a free tier at 500 pages/month. Nimble's free offer is a one-time trial, not a sustained free tier.

## Security & Compliance

Nimble holds **AICPA SOC 2 certification** and claims GDPR and CCPA alignment. Infrastructure runs on AWS and GCP with role-based access controls. For enterprise use cases where compliance documentation matters, this is relevant — most open-source MCP servers can't offer equivalent certifications.

## How It Compares

| Feature | Nimble | [Bright Data](https://chatforest.com/reviews/bright-data-mcp-server/) | [Firecrawl](https://chatforest.com/reviews/firecrawl-mcp-server/) | [Apify](https://chatforest.com/reviews/apify-mcp-server/) |
|---------|--------|------------|-----------|-------|
| **Tools** | 7 | 60+ (Pro) | 19 | 17+ |
| **Search accuracy** | 93% | 100% | 83% | 78% |
| **Stress test** | 51.2% | 76.8% | 64.8% | 18.8% |
| **Google Maps** | 3 dedicated tools | No | No | Via Actors |
| **E-commerce** | Structured templates | 10+ vertical scrapers | General extraction | Via marketplace |
| **Free tier** | Trial only (5K pages) | 5K req/month ongoing | 500 pages/month | $5/month credits |
| **Self-hosting** | No | Yes (local mode) | Yes (open source) | Yes (open source) |
| **Open source** | No | MIT license | AGPL | Apache 2.0 |
| **Min paid plan** | $2,500/month | Pay-as-you-go | $19/month | $49/month |

## Limitations

- **No open source, no self-hosting.** You're fully locked into Nimble's infrastructure and pricing. If they raise prices or change terms, you have no alternative deployment option.
- **Only 7 tools.** Compared to Bright Data's 60+ or Firecrawl's 19, the tool surface is limited. No browser automation, no social media scraping, no financial data extraction.
- **Stress test performance is poor.** 51.2% success at 182.3 seconds under concurrent load makes this unsuitable for high-volume parallel agent workflows.
- **Expensive entry point.** $2,500/month minimum for managed plans, with only a one-time trial rather than an ongoing free tier.
- **Closed-source trust model.** No way to audit how your data is handled, what's cached, or how requests are routed. The SOC 2 certification partially addresses this, but transparency-minded teams may prefer open-source alternatives.
- **No public GitHub community.** No issue tracker, no community contributions, no way to report bugs publicly or track development velocity.

## The Bottom Line

Nimble MCP's strongest selling point is its **Google Maps intelligence suite** — three dedicated tools for business discovery, venue details, and review extraction that no other MCP server matches. If local business data is core to your agent's workflow, Nimble fills a genuine gap.

For everything else, the value proposition is harder to justify. The 93% search accuracy is strong but trails [Bright Data's](https://chatforest.com/reviews/bright-data-mcp-server/) 100%. The stress test performance is concerning for production workloads. The pricing is enterprise-tier without a sustained free tier. And the closed-source, hosted-only model limits flexibility.

**Who should use this:** Teams building agents that need local business intelligence (Google Maps data), e-commerce price monitoring across major retailers, or enterprises that require SOC 2 compliance documentation for their web data pipeline.

**Who should look elsewhere:** Individual developers, teams on a budget, anyone needing browser automation or social media scraping, or high-concurrency agent deployments. [Bright Data](https://chatforest.com/reviews/bright-data-mcp-server/) offers more tools with better stress performance at lower entry cost. [Firecrawl](https://chatforest.com/reviews/firecrawl-mcp-server/) handles general web scraping with an open-source self-hosted option.

**Rating: 3/5** — Strong Google Maps niche and solid single-agent accuracy, but limited tool set, poor concurrent performance, high pricing floor, and closed-source lock-in keep it behind more versatile alternatives.
