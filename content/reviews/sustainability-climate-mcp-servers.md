card_description: "Sustainability and climate MCP servers for carbon emissions calculation, building energy simulation, air quality monitoring, power grid intelligence, and climate data access. The category is emerging with some genuinely useful tools, though significant gaps remain in ESG reporting, supply chain tracking, and lifecycle assessment. **jagan-shanmugam/climatiq-mcp-server is the go-to for carbon calculations** — 6 stars, 7+ tools wrapping the Climatiq API for electricity, travel, cloud computing, freight, and procurement emissions with support for searching 68,000+ emission factors across regions and industries. **LBNL-ETA/EnergyPlus-MCP is the most ambitious server** — 35 specialized tools from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory enabling AI-driven building energy modeling with the DOE's EnergyPlus simulation engine, covering model management, HVAC topology visualization, automated simulation execution, and results analysis with interactive plots. Published in SoftwareX journal. **MCP-Energy-Hub brings power grid awareness to AI** — 8 tools providing real-time US power grid intelligence via the EIA API, with the standout get_best_region_for_compute tool that finds the lowest carbon-intensity region across CAISO, ERCOT, PJM, NYISO, and MISO for scheduling AI training runs and data center workloads. **PowerMCP enables power system simulation** — Power-Agent's collection of MCP servers for PowerWorld and OpenDSS, letting LLMs interact with professional power system software for load flow analysis, fault simulation, and grid optimization. Part of a broader ecosystem including PowerSkills and PowerFM foundation models. **Air quality gets three MCP servers** — mattmarcin/aqicn-mcp queries AQICN.org for global AQI data by city, coordinates, or station; michaelahern/airthings-consumer-mcp reads from Airthings hardware monitors; danielrosehill/Google-Air-Quality-MCP wraps Google's environmental API (WIP). **open-meteo-mcp provides comprehensive climate data** — cmer81's 10+ tool server covers weather forecasts, historical ERA5 archives back to 1940, air quality indices (PM2.5, PM10, ozone, NO2, pollen), marine weather, flood forecasts via GloFAS, seasonal predictions up to 9 months, and CMIP6 climate change projections under different warming scenarios. All free, no API key required. **ClimateTriage connects AI to climate action** — Codeshark-NET's server searches for open source issues related to climate change and sustainability, helping developers find contribution opportunities filtered by language, category, and project. **Gaps remain substantial** — no official MCP servers from carbon registries (Gold Standard, Verra), no life cycle assessment tools, no ESG/CSRD/EU Taxonomy reporting framework, no waste management or circular economy tools, no satellite-based environmental monitoring (deforestation, ocean health), no supply chain carbon tracking, and no renewable energy certificate management. The category earns 3.5/5 — genuinely useful tools for carbon calculation and building energy modeling, plus strong climate data access, but the sustainability domain is vast and MCP coverage is still early-stage."

Sustainability and climate MCP servers are bringing environmental intelligence directly into AI workflows — calculating carbon emissions, simulating building energy performance, monitoring air quality, and accessing climate projections, all through the Model Context Protocol. Instead of juggling APIs, spreadsheets, and separate calculation tools, these servers let AI assistants handle sustainability-related queries and analysis natively.

This review covers **sustainability and climate MCP servers** — carbon emissions calculators, building energy simulators, power grid intelligence, air quality monitors, climate data providers, and open source climate contribution tools. For weather-focused servers without the sustainability angle, see our [Weather MCP review](/reviews/weather-mcp-servers/) if available. For IoT device monitoring that includes environmental sensors, see our [IoT & Smart Home review](/reviews/iot-smart-home-mcp-servers/).

The headline findings: **Climatiq MCP wraps 68,000+ emission factors** for carbon calculations across electricity, travel, cloud, and freight. **EnergyPlus-MCP from Lawrence Berkeley National Lab offers 35 tools** for DOE building energy simulation. **MCP-Energy-Hub enables carbon-aware compute scheduling** across US power grid regions. **open-meteo-mcp provides CMIP6 climate projections** alongside weather, air quality, and flood forecasts — all free. **No major carbon registries or ESG frameworks** have MCP servers yet.

## What's Missing

The sustainability MCP ecosystem has notable gaps:

- **No carbon registry MCPs** — Gold Standard, Verra, and other carbon credit registries have no MCP servers for verification or offset tracking
- **No life cycle assessment (LCA)** — no MCP for tools like openLCA or SimaPro for product environmental footprinting
- **No ESG/CSRD reporting** — despite growing regulatory requirements (EU CSRD, ISSB), no MCP server handles ESG data collection or compliance reporting
- **No waste management** — no circular economy, recycling optimization, or waste tracking MCPs
- **No satellite environmental monitoring** — no deforestation detection, ocean health, or land use change via satellite imagery
- **No supply chain carbon tracking** — Scope 3 emissions across supply chains remain unaddressed
- **No renewable energy certificate (REC) management** — no tracking or verification of green energy credits
- **No biodiversity monitoring** — no species tracking, habitat assessment, or ecological survey tools

---

## The Bottom Line

The sustainability and climate MCP server category earns **3.5 out of 5**. There are genuinely useful tools here — Climatiq for carbon calculations, EnergyPlus-MCP for building energy modeling (with the academic credibility of LBNL behind it), MCP-Energy-Hub for carbon-aware compute scheduling, and open-meteo-mcp for free comprehensive climate data including CMIP6 projections.

The power systems subcategory is surprisingly active, with PowerMCP and dedicated OpenDSS servers enabling professional-grade grid simulation. Air quality monitoring has decent coverage across global (AQICN), hardware (Airthings), and Google APIs.

But the sustainability domain is vast, and MCP coverage is still early-stage. The biggest gaps — ESG reporting frameworks, supply chain Scope 3 emissions, life cycle assessment, and carbon credit verification — are precisely the areas where AI-assisted automation could have the most impact. As regulatory requirements like the EU's CSRD expand, expect this category to grow rapidly.

**Best starting points:** Climatiq MCP for carbon calculations, open-meteo-mcp for climate data, EnergyPlus-MCP for building professionals.
