**At a glance:** Security scanning is where AppSec vendors are **racing to instrument AI coding agents**. Unlike [monitoring/observability](/reviews/monitoring-observability-mcp-servers/) where vendors built MCP servers to expose existing data, security vendors are building MCP servers to **intercept and scan code as AI agents write it**. [Semgrep](https://github.com/semgrep/mcp) leads community adoption (641 stars on the archived standalone repo) with MCP now built directly into the Semgrep binary — 7 tools covering SAST, SCA, and Secrets across 5,000+ rules. [SonarQube](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube-mcp-server) (442 stars, Java) is the most actively maintained standalone server with code analysis and quality gate checks. [Snyk](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/developer-guardrails-for-agentic-workflows/snyk-mcp-experimental) integrates MCP directly into its CLI (experimental). [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-mcp) (38 stars, Go) handles containers and IaC. [GitGuardian](https://github.com/GitGuardian/ggmcp) (34 stars) brings 500+ secret detectors to MCP. This is the **tenth review in our [Developer Tools MCP category](/categories/developer-tools/)**.

The application security testing market ($13.6–15.6B in 2025, projected $36–55B by 2030) is driving vendor investment in "agentic security" — the idea that security scanning should happen **inside the AI coding loop**, not after code is committed. Semgrep, Snyk, SonarQube, Cycode, Contrast, and Mend have all shipped MCP integrations within the past year. The pitch is compelling: catch vulnerabilities before they reach a pull request, with the AI agent fixing issues in real-time rather than creating backlog tickets. But the ecosystem is young — most servers launched in 2025, star counts are modest compared to other Developer Tools categories, and no standard exists for how security findings should be structured in MCP responses.

**Architecture note:** Security scanning MCP servers follow two patterns. **CLI-integrated** servers (Semgrep, Snyk, Cycode) embed MCP directly into their existing CLI tools — you run `semgrep mcp` or `snyk mcp --experimental` and the CLI becomes an MCP server. This approach reuses existing scanner infrastructure and stays automatically in sync with the main tool. **Standalone** servers (SonarQube, GitGuardian, Trivy, Contrast) are separate repos that connect to the vendor's platform via API. The CLI-integrated approach is emerging as the preferred pattern for security tools because it avoids duplicating scanner logic. Most servers support stdio transport for IDE integration (Cursor, Claude Code, VS Code, Windsurf).

## What's Available

### Semgrep — SAST Leader Goes MCP-Native

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Repository | [semgrep/mcp](https://github.com/semgrep/mcp) (archived — now built into `semgrep` binary) |
| Stars | ~641 |
| Forks | ~57 |
| Language | Python |
| License | MIT |
| Creator | Semgrep (official) |
| Status | Archived standalone; MCP built into `semgrep/semgrep` CLI |

**7 tools** for comprehensive static analysis:

| Tool | Capability |
|------|-----------|
| security_check | Run all three Semgrep products (Code, Supply Chain, Secrets) |
| semgrep_scan | Targeted scan with specific rulesets |
| semgrep_scan_with_custom_rule | Scan using user-defined rules |
| get_abstract_syntax_tree | Parse and return AST for a file |
| semgrep_findings | Query findings from Semgrep AppSec Platform |
| supported_languages | List all supported programming languages |
| semgrep_rule_schema | Get the schema for writing custom rules |

**Key differentiator:** The **most-starred security scanning MCP server** and the first to move from standalone repo to CLI-integrated architecture. Running `semgrep mcp` starts an MCP server with access to 5,000+ rules across SAST, SCA (Supply Chain), and Secrets detection. Supports stdio, streamable-http, and SSE transports. Deterministic static analysis means no false positives from AI interpretation — Semgrep finds the issue, the LLM explains and fixes it. Multi-language support across 30+ languages. Can connect to the Semgrep AppSec Platform API for cloud-managed findings.

**Limitation:** The standalone repo (641 stars) is archived — users must install the full Semgrep CLI to get MCP. Semgrep's SAST mindshare is growing (2.6%, up from 1.6%) but still trails SonarQube (17.7%). The 7-tool count is modest compared to other security platforms. Free tier has rule limitations; full rule coverage requires Semgrep Teams/Enterprise.

### SonarQube — Code Quality Meets AI Agents

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Repository | [SonarSource/sonarqube-mcp-server](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube-mcp-server) |
| Stars | ~442 |
| Forks | ~68 |
| Language | Java |
| License | Proprietary |
| Creator | SonarSource (official) |
| Latest push | March 23, 2026 (actively maintained) |

**Key tools:** `run_advanced_code_analysis` (beta, SonarQube Cloud only), `analyze_code_snippet` (direct snippet analysis in agent context), issue retrieval, quality gate checks, security hotspot review, metrics and branch analysis. Supports 20+ languages: Java, Kotlin, Python, Ruby, Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, JSP, PHP, XML, HTML, CSS, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, Terraform, ARM, Ansible, Docker, and Secrets detection.

**Key differentiator:** The **most actively maintained** standalone security scanning MCP server (pushed March 23, 2026). SonarQube holds the largest SAST mindshare (17.7%) and the MCP server brings that analysis to AI coding agents. Works with both SonarQube Server (self-hosted) and SonarQube Cloud. The `analyze_code_snippet` tool lets AI agents scan code fragments without committing — ideal for real-time security checks during code generation. Container image available at `mcp/sonarqube`. Wide IDE support: Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, VS Code (GitHub Copilot), Windsurf, Zed.

**Limitation:** Java implementation requires JVM. The proprietary license limits community contributions and forks. `run_advanced_code_analysis` is beta and Cloud-only. SonarQube's traditional strength is code quality (code smells, duplication, coverage) more than security — teams needing deep SAST may pair it with a dedicated security tool. Quality gate results can be noisy without careful rule configuration.

### Snyk — Full Platform Security via CLI MCP

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Repository | [snyk/studio-mcp](https://github.com/snyk/studio-mcp) |
| Stars | ~27 |
| Forks | ~10 |
| Language | Go |
| License | Apache-2.0 |
| Creator | Snyk (official) |
| CLI integration | Built into Snyk CLI v1.1296.2+ as `snyk mcp --experimental` |

**Capabilities:** Triggers CLI security scans for code (SAST), dependencies (SCA), containers, and infrastructure-as-code. Generates SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials). Monitors projects for new vulnerabilities. Supports stdio and SSE transports.

**Key differentiator:** Snyk is the **broadest security platform** with MCP integration — SAST, SCA, container scanning, and IaC scanning from a single CLI command. The `snyk mcp --experimental` approach means MCP stays in sync with the full Snyk CLI capability set. Snyk's vulnerability database (curated by security researchers) provides high-quality findings with remediation advice. Works with GitHub Copilot, Continue, Cursor, Qodo, Windsurf, and other MCP-enabled tools. SBOM generation is unique among security MCP servers.

**Limitation:** Still marked `--experimental` — not GA. The `studio-mcp` repo has only 27 stars despite Snyk's 4.4% container security mindshare. Requires a Snyk account and API token. Community alternative ([sammcj/mcp-snyk](https://github.com/sammcj/mcp-snyk), 15 stars) exists but is stale (last pushed February 2025). The experimental status means the API surface may change without notice.

### Trivy — Open-Source Container and IaC Scanning

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Repository | [aquasecurity/trivy-mcp](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-mcp) |
| Stars | ~38 |
| Forks | ~7 |
| Language | Go |
| License | MIT |
| Creator | Aqua Security (official) |
| Latest push | December 2025 |

**Capabilities:** Vulnerability scanning in dependencies, container images, IaC files, and remote repositories. Multi-language support (Python/pip, Node.js/npm, Go, Rust, PHP, Ruby). Automatic fix suggestions for vulnerable package versions. Severity-level reporting.

**Key differentiator:** The **only fully open-source, free** comprehensive vulnerability scanner with an official MCP server. Trivy's main repo has 23k+ GitHub stars — the MCP server brings that scanning capability to AI coding agents. Can scan local filesystems, container images, and remote repos through natural language queries. Automatic fix suggestions (updating to non-vulnerable package versions) enable AI agents to scan-and-fix in a single loop. MIT license means no vendor lock-in.

**Limitation:** Only 38 stars on the MCP repo despite Trivy's massive community (23k+ stars on the main repo). Last pushed December 2025 — moderate maintenance. Trivy's strength is SCA and container scanning; its SAST capabilities are less mature than Semgrep or SonarQube. The MCP server surfaces Trivy's findings but doesn't add MCP-specific intelligence (no result caching, no finding deduplication across scans).

### GitGuardian — Secret Scanning Specialist

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Repository | [GitGuardian/ggmcp](https://github.com/GitGuardian/ggmcp) |
| Stars | ~34 |
| Forks | ~12 |
| Language | Python |
| License | MIT |
| Creator | GitGuardian (official) |
| Latest push | March 23, 2026 (actively maintained) |

**Capabilities:** Scan projects for hardcoded secrets using 500+ detectors. Manage secret incidents. Inject honeytokens for breach detection. Real-time `secret_scan` tool. Read-only permissions by design.

**Key differentiator:** The **most focused secret scanning MCP server** with 500+ detection patterns. GitGuardian specializes exclusively in secrets — API keys, passwords, tokens, certificates — and the MCP server brings that specialization to AI coding workflows. Read-only design means the MCP server can scan but can't accidentally expose or leak secrets. Honeytoken injection is a unique defensive capability: plant fake credentials that alert you when someone tries to use them. Actively maintained (pushed March 23, 2026).

**Limitation:** Narrow scope — secrets only, no SAST, SCA, or IaC scanning. Requires GitGuardian API key and account. The 34-star count is low for a dedicated security vendor. No open-source alternative with comparable detection breadth. Teams already using GitHub's built-in secret scanning (free for public repos) may not need a separate MCP server for this capability.

### Cycode — Full ASPM via CLI MCP

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Repository | [cycodehq/cycode-cli](https://github.com/cycodehq/cycode-cli) (MCP built into CLI) |
| Stars | ~97 (CLI repo) |
| Forks | ~63 |
| Language | Python |
| License | MIT |
| Creator | Cycode (official) |

**Capabilities:** SAST, SCA, Secrets scanning, and IaC scanning on local files, Git repos, and commit ranges. Detailed vulnerability reports with remediation guidance.

**Key differentiator:** Cycode provides **Application Security Posture Management (ASPM)** — a unified view across SAST, SCA, secrets, and IaC scanning from a single CLI. The MCP integration means AI agents get comprehensive security coverage without configuring multiple tools. Listed in the official MCP servers repository. Works with Cursor, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot. Remediation guidance is included with findings, enabling AI agents to fix issues immediately.

**Limitation:** The 97-star count is for the entire CLI repo, not MCP specifically. Requires Python 3.10+ and a Cycode account. Smaller vendor than Semgrep, Snyk, or SonarQube — less community support and fewer online resources. The MCP capability is embedded in the CLI rather than documented as a standalone feature.

### Contrast Security — IAST Bridge to AI Agents

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Repository | [Contrast-Security-OSS/mcp-contrast](https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/mcp-contrast) |
| Stars | ~16 |
| Forks | ~5 |
| Language | Java |
| License | Apache-2.0 |
| Creator | Contrast Security (official) |
| Latest push | March 2026 (active) |

**Capabilities:** Bridge to Contrast IAST vulnerability data. Full taint-flow traces from source to sink. Specific HTTP requests that triggered findings. Environment and application details.

**Key differentiator:** The **only IAST-focused MCP server**. Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) instruments running applications and detects vulnerabilities during execution — providing more context than SAST (which analyzes code statically). The taint-flow traces show exactly how user input flows through the application to a vulnerable sink, giving AI agents the information needed for precise remediation. Unlike SAST results that may be false positives, IAST findings are confirmed by actual execution.

**Limitation:** Requires Contrast Security enterprise platform (no free tier). Only 16 stars. Java implementation. Contrast explicitly warns against using their MCP server with LLMs that train on your data — enterprise-grade sandboxed LLMs are recommended. IAST requires the application to be running with Contrast agents instrumented, which limits scanning to deployed/running code only.

### CodeQL Community — GitHub's Query Language via MCP

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Repository | [JordyZomer/codeql-mcp](https://github.com/JordyZomer/codeql-mcp) |
| Stars | ~143 |
| Forks | ~19 |
| Language | Python |
| Creator | Community |

Wraps the CodeQL query server, enabling AI agents to interact with CodeQL through structured commands. A quasi-official [codeql-development-mcp-server](https://github.com/advanced-security/codeql-development-mcp-server) (12 stars, TypeScript) from GitHub's CodeQL Expert Services team focuses on CodeQL query development (AST, CFG, CLI, and LSP tools) rather than scanning results.

**Key differentiator:** CodeQL is GitHub's **semantic code analysis engine** — it treats code as data and runs queries against it to find vulnerabilities. The community MCP server brings this capability to AI agents. CodeQL powers GitHub Advanced Security's code scanning and has the deepest semantic understanding of any free SAST tool.

**Limitation:** Community-built, not official from GitHub. CodeQL requires a compiled database of your code, which adds setup complexity. The development MCP server from GitHub's team is for writing CodeQL queries, not running scans. CodeQL is free for open-source repos but requires GitHub Advanced Security licenses for private repos.

### Additional Servers

**[Anchore Grype MCP](https://github.com/anchore/grype-mcp)** (9 stars, Python) — Official container image and filesystem vulnerability scanner. Minimal adoption, last updated August 2025.

**[Nuclei MCP](https://github.com/addcontent/nuclei-mcp)** (43 stars, Go, MIT) — Community server wrapping ProjectDiscovery's Nuclei template-based vulnerability scanner. Context-aware scanning with template management and result caching.

**[MCPwner](https://github.com/Pigyon/MCPwner)** (41 stars, Python, Apache-2.0) — Community autonomous vulnerability discovery tool unifying secret scanning, SAST, SCA, and 0-day research. Actively maintained (March 2026).

**[AWS Sample Security Scanner](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-mcp-security-scanner)** (10 stars, Python, MIT-0) — Reference implementation combining Checkov + Semgrep + Bandit for IaC and multi-language SAST.

**[OSV MCP](https://github.com/gleicon/mcp-osv)** (14 stars, Go) — Queries Google's OSV.dev vulnerability database for dependency analysis.

**[GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server)** — GitHub's official MCP server added secret scanning and push protection features (August 2025, expanded March 2026). Scans tool-call inputs for exposed secrets. On by default for public repos and private repos with GitHub Advanced Security.

**Mend SAST** — Commercial "agentic SAST" via MCP (no public repo). Checks AI-generated code for CWEs and CVEs before it enters the repo. Iterates up to 3 times to produce secure code. Forrester Strong Performer in SAST Wave Q3 2025.

### Notable Gaps

**No MCP servers found** for: Veracode, Fortify (OpenText), TruffleHog (standalone), Gitleaks (open issue #1869 proposes MCP support), Dependabot/Renovate, or python-safety. Checkmarx has a minimal community server (1 star) and a commercial "Checkmarx One Assist" integration but no substantial open-source MCP presence.

## Known Issues

1. **No standard format for security findings in MCP** — Each server returns findings in its own format. No MCP security server uses SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format), CycloneDX, or any other industry-standard report format. This means AI agents can't easily compare or correlate findings across different scanners. A Semgrep finding and a SonarQube finding for the same vulnerability look completely different to the LLM.

2. **False positive handling is primitive** — Traditional security tools have sophisticated false-positive suppression (SonarQube's "won't fix" markings, Semgrep's `nosemgrep` comments, Snyk's ignore policies). MCP servers pass raw results to the LLM, which may or may not interpret them correctly. There's no MCP-native mechanism for marking findings as false positives or suppressing known issues. AI agents may repeatedly flag the same suppressed issue.

3. **No real-time DAST via MCP** — Dynamic Application Security Testing requires a running application target. No MCP server currently orchestrates spinning up an application and running dynamic security tests against it. Contrast Security's IAST is the closest (it instruments running applications), but the MCP server only reads findings — it doesn't trigger new scans. This is a significant gap: DAST catches vulnerabilities that SAST misses (authentication flaws, runtime injection, business logic bugs).

4. **CI/CD integration is indirect** — MCP servers are designed for IDE/agent interaction, not CI/CD pipelines. Teams still need separate CI/CD integrations for the same security tools. An AI agent can scan code in the IDE via MCP, but the same code gets re-scanned by a different integration in CI. No MCP-native CI/CD security scanning pattern exists yet.

5. **MCP servers are themselves an attack surface** — Between January–February 2026, 30+ CVEs were filed targeting MCP servers/clients/infrastructure, including a CVSS 9.6 RCE flaw. An AgentSeal scan of 1,808 MCP servers found 66% had security findings, 38% had no authentication, and 76 contained confirmed malicious payloads. Security scanning MCP servers are not immune to the very vulnerabilities they detect — ironic but real.

6. **Prompt injection risk in security context** — Code being scanned could contain prompt injection payloads designed to influence the LLM's interpretation of security results. A malicious code comment could instruct the LLM to ignore or downplay a finding. This is a novel attack vector unique to AI-assisted security scanning that traditional tools don't face. No security MCP server currently sanitizes scan results for prompt injection content.

7. **Vendor lock-in across the board** — Every official security MCP server requires its vendor's platform (Semgrep account, SonarQube instance, Snyk API key, GitGuardian API key, Cycode account, Contrast enterprise license). The only genuinely free option is Trivy MCP (MIT, no account required for basic scanning). Teams wanting multi-scanner coverage need accounts with multiple vendors.

8. **Low adoption relative to tool popularity** — Semgrep's main repo has thousands of stars, but the MCP server has 641 (archived). SonarQube has 17.7% SAST mindshare but only 442 MCP stars. Trivy has 23k+ stars but only 38 on the MCP server. Snyk's MCP has 27 stars despite being a $8.5B+ valued company. Security teams have not yet broadly adopted MCP-based scanning workflows.

9. **Remediation automation is shallow** — While Semgrep, Snyk, and Trivy provide fix suggestions, no MCP server implements a true scan-fix-verify loop (scan code → find vulnerability → apply fix → re-scan to confirm fix works → report). AI agents can build this loop themselves, but it requires prompt engineering rather than being a built-in server capability. Mend's commercial "agentic SAST" (iterates up to 3 times) is the closest, but it's closed-source.

10. **Enterprise SAST/DAST leaders are missing** — Veracode, Fortify (OpenText), and Checkmarx — three of the largest enterprise application security vendors — have minimal or no open-source MCP presence. This leaves a gap for enterprises that have standardized on these platforms. They'll need to wait for vendor support or build custom MCP servers that wrap their existing APIs.

## Bottom Line

**Rating: 3.5 out of 5**

The security scanning MCP ecosystem has **the highest vendor count** of any Developer Tools subcategory — seven or more vendors (Semgrep, SonarQube, Snyk, Trivy, GitGuardian, Cycode, Contrast) have shipped official MCP servers within the past year. The concept is compelling: security scanning embedded directly in the AI coding loop, catching vulnerabilities before they reach a pull request. Semgrep's CLI-integrated approach (7 tools, 5,000+ rules, SAST/SCA/Secrets) sets the architectural template. SonarQube provides the most actively maintained standalone server. Snyk offers the broadest platform coverage (SAST + SCA + containers + IaC) from a single CLI.

The **3.5/5 rating** reflects: strong vendor investment (7+ official servers in under a year), the CLI-integrated architecture pattern emerging as best practice (Semgrep, Snyk, Cycode), Semgrep's comprehensive rule coverage (5,000+ rules), SonarQube's active maintenance and wide IDE support, Trivy's fully open-source approach, and the genuine utility of real-time security scanning during AI-assisted coding. It loses the remaining 1.5 points for low community adoption (641 max stars, most under 100), no SARIF or standard finding format, missing DAST capability, the prompt injection risk unique to AI-security workflows, vendor lock-in across all servers except Trivy, shallow remediation automation, absent enterprise vendors (Veracode, Fortify, Checkmarx), and the ironic reality that MCP servers themselves are an expanding attack surface.

**Who benefits from security scanning MCP servers today:**

- **AI-assisted development teams** — If your developers use Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, or Windsurf, adding Semgrep or SonarQube MCP gives real-time security feedback as AI generates code. This is the primary use case vendors are targeting
- **DevSecOps teams** — Teams already running Snyk, Semgrep, or SonarQube in CI/CD can extend the same security policies to the IDE via MCP, creating a "shift-further-left" workflow where issues are caught during generation, not just during review
- **Open-source maintainers** — Trivy's MCP server (MIT, free, no account) provides container and dependency scanning for projects that can't afford commercial security tools
- **Secret leak prevention** — GitGuardian's 500+ detectors and GitHub's built-in MCP secret scanning provide layered defense against accidentally committing credentials

**Who should be cautious:**

- **Enterprise security teams on Veracode/Fortify/Checkmarx** — Your primary SAST/DAST vendors don't have substantial MCP servers yet. Adding a different scanner via MCP creates tool sprawl and inconsistent policy enforcement
- **Teams expecting production-grade security** — MCP security scanning is IDE-focused and experimental (Snyk literally uses `--experimental`). It supplements but does not replace CI/CD security gates, code review, and penetration testing
- **Compliance-driven organizations** — No security scanning MCP server provides audit trails, compliance reporting, or SOC 2/HIPAA attestation for findings. The lack of SARIF output means results can't feed into existing compliance workflows
- **Teams concerned about AI data privacy** — Contrast Security explicitly warns against using their MCP server with LLMs that train on your data. Code sent through MCP to an AI agent may transit through cloud LLM APIs — verify your LLM provider's data handling before scanning sensitive code
