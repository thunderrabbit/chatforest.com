card_description: "Robotics and IoT MCP servers across robot control, smart home automation, hardware communication, robot simulation, and industrial IoT. The standout is robotmcp/ros-mcp-server (969 stars, Python, MIT) — connecting LLMs like Claude, GPT, and Gemini with ROS/ROS2 robots through bidirectional AI integration. Natural language commands are translated into ROS topics, services, and actions. Works with both ROS1 and ROS2 and integrates with any MCP-enabled LLM. lpigeon/ros-mcp-server (873 stars, Python) is an alternative ROS implementation with similar capabilities. homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp (1.1K stars, Python) provides 80+ tools for AI assistants to control Home Assistant — device control, automation management, entity search, calendars, todo lists, dashboards, backup/restore, history/statistics, camera snapshots, and system queries. Home Assistant official MCP integration (built into HA 2025.2+) exposes the Assist API as an MCP server with zero external setup. tevonsb/homeassistant-mcp (500+ stars, TypeScript, Apache 2.0) provides device control, automation management, state monitoring, and SSE real-time updates with rate limiting and token-based auth. omni-mcp/isaac-sim-mcp (Python, MIT) enables natural language control of NVIDIA Isaac Sim for robot simulation — supports Franka, JetBot, Carter, G1, Go1 robots with physics-based interactions, custom lighting, obstacle placement, and maze environments. mcp2everything/mcp2serial (35 stars, Python) bridges serial hardware (Raspberry Pi Pico, Arduino) to LLMs via MCP with auto-detection and multi-baud-rate support. vishalmysore/choturobo (74 stars, JavaScript) integrates Arduino ESP32/Nano with Claude AI for LED, motor, servo, and sensor control via Johnny-Five. UnitApi/mcp (Python) provides a comprehensive hardware abstraction layer for secure device control — GPIO, LEDs, buttons, traffic lights on Raspberry Pi with WebSocket streaming. ezhuk/mqtt-mcp (Python) is a lightweight MQTT bridge using FastMCP 2.0 for building automation, industrial control, and smart home systems with Docker and CLI deployment options. poly-mcp/IoT-Edge-MCP-Server (Python) unifies MQTT sensors, Modbus devices, and SCADA/PLC equipment into a single AI-orchestrable API with InfluxDB time-series storage, Redis cache, real-time alarms, and actuator control. awslabs aws-iot-sitewise-mcp-server (Python, Apache 2.0) provides comprehensive AWS IoT SiteWise functionality — gateway management, time series, anomaly detection, edge computing, and multi-layer storage. CorefluxCommunity/Coreflux-MQTT-MCP-Server (Python) connects to Coreflux MQTT brokers with TLS, Copilot AI code generation, and dynamic action discovery. Benniu/emqx-mcp-server (Python) manages EMQX MQTT broker — publish messages, disconnect clients, subscribe topics via SSE. mcp2everything/mcp2mqtt (Python, 11 stars) converts MCP to MQTT for smart home and robot control. mcp2everything/mcp2tcp (Python) connects TCP devices to LLMs. kakimochi/ros2-mcp-server (70 stars, Python) provides ROS 2 integration with cmd_vel topic publishing. TakanariShimbo/rosbridge-mcp-server (Python) bridges ROS via rosbridge WebSocket. Gaps: no unified robotics simulation + real hardware server, ROS MCP servers require a running ROS environment (non-trivial setup), Home Assistant servers can't create custom integrations or install add-ons, MQTT servers don't support MQTT 5.0 shared subscriptions, no direct support for Zigbee/Z-Wave/Matter protocols (must go through Home Assistant or a broker), industrial IoT servers are early-stage with limited production deployments, no real-time video/camera feed processing for robot vision, no digital twin synchronization between simulation and physical robots. Rating: 3.5/5."

Robotics and IoT MCP servers bridge the gap between AI assistants and the **physical world** — robots, smart home devices, sensors, industrial equipment, and embedded microcontrollers. Instead of writing ROS commands, clicking through Home Assistant dashboards, or crafting MQTT payloads, you tell your AI assistant what you want in natural language and the MCP server translates that into hardware actions.

This is a rapidly emerging category. A year ago, almost none of these servers existed. Now there's a curated [awesome-mcp-hardware](https://github.com/beriberikix/awesome-mcp-hardware) list tracking the space. The MCP protocol's standardized tool interface turns out to be a natural fit for hardware — each device capability maps cleanly to a tool definition.

## Robot Control — ROS (4 servers)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Key Feature |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| [robotmcp/ros-mcp-server](https://github.com/robotmcp/ros-mcp-server) | 969 | Python | MIT | Bidirectional ROS1/ROS2 AI integration |
| [lpigeon/ros-mcp-server](https://github.com/lpigeon/ros-mcp-server) | 873 | Python | — | Natural language → ROS/ROS2 commands |
| [kakimochi/ros2-mcp-server](https://github.com/kakimochi/ros2-mcp-server) | 70 | Python | — | ROS 2 cmd_vel topic publishing |
| [TakanariShimbo/rosbridge-mcp-server](https://github.com/TakanariShimbo/rosbridge-mcp-server) | — | Python | — | ROS via rosbridge WebSocket |

**robotmcp/ros-mcp-server** (969 stars) is the most popular robotics MCP server. It connects LLMs (Claude, GPT, Gemini) with robots through bidirectional AI integration — the AI can command the robot *and* the robot's sensor data flows back to the AI for informed decision-making. Natural language instructions are translated into ROS topics, services, and actions. Works with both ROS1 and ROS2. The key value: instead of writing `rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist ...`, you say "move the robot forward slowly" and the AI handles the translation. Integrates with any MCP-enabled LLM client.

**lpigeon/ros-mcp-server** (873 stars) takes a similar approach with a focus on transforming natural language commands into ROS/ROS2 commands for robot control. Both projects have strong community adoption, with combined star counts approaching 2K — a signal that the robotics community sees real value in LLM-driven robot control.

**kakimochi/ros2-mcp-server** (70 stars) is a more focused ROS 2 implementation, specifically enabling AI assistants like Claude to control robots by publishing movement commands to the `/cmd_vel` topic. Simpler scope, but clear and practical.

**rosbridge-mcp-server** provides a different integration path — instead of running alongside ROS, it connects through rosbridge's WebSocket interface. This is valuable if you need to control ROS from a different machine or network, since rosbridge is already a standard remote access layer for ROS systems.

## Smart Home Automation (4 servers)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools | Key Feature |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| [homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp](https://github.com/homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp) | 1.1K | Python | — | 80+ | Comprehensive HA control + automations |
| [Home Assistant Official](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mcp_server/) | Built-in | — | — | — | Zero-setup MCP via Assist API |
| [tevonsb/homeassistant-mcp](https://github.com/tevonsb/homeassistant-mcp) | 500+ | TypeScript | Apache 2.0 | — | SSE real-time updates + rate limiting |
| [jordy33/iot_mcp_server](https://github.com/jordy33/iot_mcp_server) | 2 | Python | — | — | MQTT-based IoT device management |

**ha-mcp** (1.1K stars) is the most feature-rich Home Assistant MCP server, with 80+ tools spanning device control, automation management, entity search, calendars, todo lists, dashboards, backup/restore, history/statistics, camera snapshots, and system queries. No paid subscription required — it runs locally and your data stays on your network. The sheer breadth of tools means your AI assistant can do almost anything you'd do through the Home Assistant UI: "Turn off all lights in the bedroom," "Create an automation that locks the front door at 11pm," or "Show me the temperature history for the living room this week." Supports Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Cursor, and other MCP clients.

**Home Assistant Official MCP Integration** (built into HA 2025.2+) takes a different, more conservative approach. Instead of exposing 80+ individual tools, it exposes the **Assist API** — Home Assistant's existing natural language interface — as an MCP server. This means the AI assistant talks to Home Assistant the same way a voice assistant would. Zero external setup: just enable the integration in your HA instance. The trade-off is less granular control compared to ha-mcp, but it's officially supported and maintained by the Home Assistant team.

**homeassistant-mcp** (500+ stars) by tevonsb bridges Home Assistant with LLMs using TypeScript. Distinguishing features include Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time device state updates, token-based authentication, and rate limiting — important production considerations that the other community servers don't always address. Apache 2.0 licensed.

## Hardware Communication & Embedded (4 servers)

| Server | Stars | Language | Key Feature |
|--------|-------|----------|-------------|
| [vishalmysore/choturobo](https://github.com/vishalmysore/choturobo) | 74 | JavaScript | Arduino ESP32/Nano robot control |
| [mcp2everything/mcp2serial](https://github.com/mcp2everything/mcp2serial) | 35 | Python | Serial device bridge (RPi Pico, Arduino) |
| [UnitApi/mcp](https://github.com/UnitApi/mcp) | — | Python | Hardware abstraction layer + GPIO |
| [mcp2everything/mcp2tcp](https://github.com/mcp2everything/mcp2tcp) | — | Python | TCP device bridge |

**ChotuRobo** (74 stars) is the most hands-on project in this category — a working Arduino robot controlled by Claude AI through MCP. Supports NodeMCU ESP32 and Arduino Nano 368 boards using the Johnny-Five JavaScript robotics library. Control LEDs, motors, servos, and sensors through natural language commands. Operates in both wired and wireless modes. This is the kind of project that demonstrates the potential clearly: tell Claude "spin the motor at half speed" and watch physical hardware respond.

**mcp2serial** (35 stars) from the MCP2Everything project is a more general-purpose bridge between serial hardware and LLMs. Initial support targets Raspberry Pi Pico, with auto-detection of serial devices and multi-baud-rate support (default 115200). Part of the broader MCP2Everything platform, which also includes **mcp2tcp** (TCP device bridge), **mcp2mqtt** (11 stars, MQTT protocol conversion), and a documentation site. The modular approach — one MCP bridge per protocol — keeps each server simple while covering the major IoT communication paths.

**UnitApi** takes the most architecturally ambitious approach: a full **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)** for MCP-based device control. Includes GPIO control for LEDs, buttons, and traffic lights on Raspberry Pi, real-time WebSocket streaming of GPIO state, a DSL for declarative hardware configuration, an LLM integration layer for natural language control, and a plugin system for extensibility. This is designed for production use cases where you need secure, structured access to hardware — not just hobby projects.

## Robot Simulation (1 server)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Key Feature |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| [omni-mcp/isaac-sim-mcp](https://github.com/omni-mcp/isaac-sim-mcp) | — | Python | MIT | NVIDIA Isaac Sim natural language control |

**Isaac Sim MCP** enables natural language control of NVIDIA Isaac Sim — a professional robotics simulation environment used by companies developing autonomous machines. Supports multiple robot types: **Franka** (robotic arm), **JetBot** (wheeled robot), **Carter** (navigation robot), **G1** and **Go1** (quadruped/humanoid). Capabilities include physics-based robot-environment interactions, custom lighting controls, obstacle placement with customizable properties, wall creation for maze-like environments, and scene information retrieval.

The integration runs through the Isaac Sim Extension Server on localhost:8766, compatible with Isaac Sim 4.2.0 and Python 3.9+. The practical value: robotics developers can describe scenarios in natural language — "place a Franka arm next to three obstacles and simulate a pick-and-place task" — instead of writing simulation scripts. This dramatically lowers the barrier to using simulation for testing robot behaviors.

## IoT & Industrial (5 servers)

| Server | Stars | Language | Key Feature |
|--------|-------|----------|-------------|
| [ezhuk/mqtt-mcp](https://github.com/ezhuk/mqtt-mcp) | — | Python | Lightweight MQTT bridge (FastMCP 2.0) |
| [poly-mcp/IoT-Edge-MCP-Server](https://github.com/poly-mcp/IoT-Edge-MCP-Server) | — | Python | Industrial SCADA/PLC + MQTT + Modbus |
| [AWS IoT SiteWise MCP](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/tree/main/src/aws-iot-sitewise-mcp-server) | — | Python | Enterprise industrial IoT on AWS |
| [CorefluxCommunity/Coreflux-MQTT-MCP-Server](https://github.com/CorefluxCommunity/Coreflux-MQTT-MCP-Server) | — | Python | Coreflux broker + Copilot AI |
| [Benniu/emqx-mcp-server](https://github.com/Benniu/emqx-mcp-server) | — | Python | EMQX broker management |

**mqtt-mcp** is a clean, lightweight MQTT bridge built on FastMCP 2.0. Maps MQTT topics to MCP resources and tools, letting AI assistants publish and subscribe to MQTT messages. Deploys via embedded server, Docker, or CLI — the Docker option is particularly useful for IoT edge deployments. Designed for building automation (BAS), industrial control (ICS), and smart home systems. The Pythonic API using FastMCP resource templates keeps configuration minimal.

**IoT-Edge-MCP-Server** is the most ambitious industrial IoT MCP server. It unifies **MQTT sensors**, **Modbus devices**, and **SCADA/PLC equipment** into a single AI-orchestrable API, backed by InfluxDB for time-series storage and Redis for caching. Features include real-time monitoring, alarm management, and actuator control. The industrial use cases are compelling: natural language queries for predictive maintenance, AI-orchestrated multi-step industrial processes, energy optimization, and automated incident response. Built to work with PolyMCP for multi-provider AI agent orchestration.

**AWS IoT SiteWise MCP** is the enterprise-grade option, part of the official AWS MCP servers collection. Comprehensive coverage of AWS IoT SiteWise: gateway management, capability configuration, time series management, edge computing support, access policies, KMS encryption, logging, and multi-layer storage (hot/warm tiers). Includes a built-in anomaly detection workflow guide. The value here is for teams already invested in AWS IoT — this server gives your AI assistant the ability to manage your entire industrial IoT infrastructure through natural language.

**Coreflux MQTT MCP** connects to Coreflux MQTT brokers with full TLS support. Three tools: `publish_to_coreflux` (message publishing with QoS and retention), `get_broker_info` (connection details), and `copilot_assist` (query Coreflux's Copilot AI for automation code generation). The Copilot integration is unique — your AI assistant can ask another AI for help with IoT automation code.

**EMQX MCP Server** manages EMQX MQTT broker instances — publish messages with QoS 0/1/2, disconnect problematic clients, filter by node/username/connection state, and subscribe to topics via SSE (cloud deployments). Useful for MQTT broker administration rather than device control.

## The Big Picture

Robotics and IoT MCP servers are in their **early growth phase**. The ROS ecosystem has the strongest adoption (combined ~2K stars across implementations), followed by Home Assistant (1.1K+ stars for ha-mcp alone). Everything else — hardware bridges, simulation, industrial IoT — is pioneering territory with small but growing communities.

**Best in class:** ha-mcp (1.1K stars, 80+ tools) for smart home, robotmcp/ros-mcp-server (969 stars) for robotics. These are the only servers with enough community validation to suggest production readiness.

**Most exciting potential:** Isaac Sim MCP (natural language robot simulation) and IoT-Edge-MCP-Server (unified industrial IoT). Both are early but point toward a future where AI assistants are standard interfaces for physical systems.

**The MCP-over-MQTT trend:** EMQX has released both MCP-over-MQTT SDKs (TypeScript and Python) and an ESP32 library, suggesting that MQTT as a transport layer for MCP itself — not just MQTT devices controlled via MCP — is an emerging pattern. This could enable edge devices to be MCP servers directly, without an intermediate bridge.

**Key gaps:** No unified server bridges robot simulation and real hardware control. ROS MCP servers require a running ROS environment (non-trivial setup for non-roboticists). Home Assistant servers can't install add-ons or create custom integrations. No direct Zigbee/Z-Wave/Matter protocol support — you must go through Home Assistant or an MQTT broker. Industrial IoT servers have limited production deployment evidence. No real-time video/camera feed processing for robot vision through MCP. No digital twin synchronization between simulation and physical robots.

**Rating: 3.5/5** — Strong anchors in ROS (969 stars, bidirectional robot control) and Home Assistant (1.1K stars, 80+ tools), with genuinely novel entries in robot simulation (Isaac Sim) and industrial IoT (SCADA/PLC unification). But the category is fragmented across many small projects, hardware setup complexity limits adoption, and the gap between "control a LED" and "orchestrate a factory floor" is vast. The MCP-over-MQTT trend and EMQX's investment in edge-native MCP suggest this category will grow significantly — physical AI is where MCP's "universal connector" value proposition is most compelling.
