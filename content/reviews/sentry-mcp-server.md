The Sentry MCP server is Sentry's official tool for connecting AI coding agents to your error tracking data. Instead of switching to the Sentry dashboard, copying stack traces, and pasting them back into your editor, your agent can pull issue details, search events, and even invoke Sentry's AI (Seer) for root cause analysis — all from your IDE.

It's first-party. Sentry builds and maintains it at [getsentry/sentry-mcp](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-mcp). With 579 GitHub stars and ~17,800 weekly npm downloads, it has real adoption. And the killer feature: a hosted remote server at `mcp.sentry.dev` with OAuth 2.0 authentication, so there's nothing to install and no long-lived API tokens on disk.

This is the first observability tool we've reviewed, and it sets a high bar for what "first-party MCP server" should look like. But at v0.29.0, the rough edges are real.

## What It Does

The server exposes approximately 20 tools across four categories:

**Navigation & Discovery**
- `list_organizations` / `find_organizations` — find orgs you have access to
- `list_projects` / `find_projects` — list projects in an org
- `find_teams` — find teams in an organization
- `identify_user` — identify the authenticated user (name, email)

**Issue Investigation** (the core value)
- `get_issue_details` — retrieve full issue info by short ID, including stack traces
- `list_issues` — list issues from a specific project
- `list_issue_events` — list events for a specific issue
- `search_issues` — AI-powered natural language search across issues
- `get_issue_analysis` — retrieve and analyze a Sentry issue

**Event Analysis**
- `get_event` — retrieve and analyze a specific event
- `list_error_events` — list error events from a project
- `search_error_events` / `search_issue_events` — filter events by time, environment, release, user, trace ID, or tags

**Project Management & Replays**
- `create_project` — create a new project and retrieve its DSNs
- `get_client_keys` — retrieve client keys for a project
- `list_replays` — list session replays from an organization

The standout is the **Seer integration** — Sentry's AI agent for automated root cause analysis. When you hit `get_issue_analysis`, Seer doesn't just return the stack trace; it attempts to explain *why* the error happened and suggest fixes. This is a genuine differentiator — no community MCP server can replicate this because Seer is a proprietary Sentry feature.

The AI-powered search tools (`search_issues`, `search_error_events`) translate natural language into Sentry query syntax. Instead of learning Sentry's query language, you can ask "show me all 500 errors in the payments service from the last 24 hours" and the server translates that into the right query. However — and this is important — these AI search tools require a separate LLM provider key (OpenAI or Anthropic) on top of your Sentry auth. Without it, the AI search tools are unavailable, though all other tools still work.

## Setup

Sentry offers two paths:

**Remote server (recommended — zero install):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sentry": {
      "url": "https://mcp.sentry.dev/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

That's it. Your client opens a browser window, you authenticate via your existing Sentry login (OAuth 2.0), and you're connected. No tokens on disk, no environment variables, no npm install. Cursor 1.0+ has native support. Claude Desktop and other MCP clients connect via Streamable HTTP with SSE fallback.

**Local stdio (for self-hosted Sentry):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sentry": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@sentry/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "SENTRY_AUTH": "<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The stdio transport requires generating a User Auth Token from your Sentry settings. This is the path for self-hosted Sentry instances that can't use the hosted MCP endpoint.

## What's Good

**OAuth 2.0 is the right auth model.** Most MCP servers we've reviewed require long-lived API tokens stored in plaintext JSON config files. Sentry's remote server uses OAuth — you authenticate in your browser, the token is scoped and revocable, and nothing sensitive sits on disk. This is how MCP auth *should* work, and Sentry is one of the first to get it right.

**Zero-install remote hosting removes all friction.** No `npx`, no `pip install`, no Docker. Point your client at the URL, authenticate, use it. For a tool that developers will set up once and use daily, this is significant.

**Seer AI integration is a genuine differentiator.** Most error tracking MCP servers (including community alternatives) just expose CRUD operations on issues and events. Sentry's server can invoke their proprietary AI for root cause analysis and fix suggestions. When you're debugging a production error at 2am, having the server not just *show* you the stack trace but *explain* what went wrong is real value.

**The tool coverage is comprehensive.** ~20 tools covering organizations, projects, issues, events, replays, and project management. You can go from "something broke" to "here's the issue, here are the events, here's the root cause analysis" without leaving your editor.

**First-party maintenance matters.** This isn't a community wrapper that might be abandoned. It's built by the Sentry team, shipped as `@sentry/mcp-server`, and actively maintained. When Sentry adds features, the MCP server gets them.

## What's Not

**748+ GitHub issues reveal real friction.** This isn't a polished product yet:
- API communication errors where the connection works but queries fail ([#748](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-mcp/issues/748))
- Invalid token errors during authentication ([#340](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-mcp/issues/340))
- Cross-project queries return 400 errors — you must select a specific project, limiting broad investigation
- Compatibility issues with Gemini Code Assist ([#617](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-mcp/issues/617))
- `search_events` failures on certain query types ([#553](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-mcp/issues/553))

**AI search requires a separate LLM provider key.** The natural language search tools — one of the server's selling points — need an OpenAI or Anthropic API key configured separately from your Sentry auth. This means additional cost, additional configuration, and a dependency on a third-party LLM service on top of Sentry itself. The non-AI tools work without it, but losing search is a significant capability gap.

**Still pre-1.0 (v0.29.0).** The version number signals ongoing development and potential breaking changes. For a tool that developers will integrate into their daily workflow, version instability is a real concern. MCP servers in general are young, but 0.29.0 suggests rapid iteration that may break existing setups.

**63 npm dependencies.** For comparison, the Filesystem MCP server has ~10 dependencies. A large dependency tree means more surface area for supply chain issues and slower `npx` cold starts.

**Cross-project investigation is limited.** If you're debugging an issue that spans multiple services (common in microservice architectures), you can't query across projects in a single call. You need to know which project to look in first, which defeats the purpose of having an AI agent help you investigate.

**Seer may not be available everywhere.** The AI analysis features are tied to Sentry's proprietary Seer service. Self-hosted Sentry instances may not have access to Seer, reducing the server to a data retrieval tool without the analysis capabilities that justify the integration.

## Alternatives

**Community Sentry MCP servers:** [MCP-100/mcp-sentry](https://github.com/MCP-100/mcp-sentry) and [ddfourtwo/sentry-selfhosted-mcp](https://github.com/ddfourtwo/sentry-selfhosted-mcp) exist as lightweight alternatives. Neither has Seer integration or OAuth support — they're basic API wrappers. The official server is the clear choice if you're on Sentry Cloud.

**Datadog MCP Server:** Datadog's official MCP server covers APM, infrastructure, logs, and RUM — a broader observability surface than Sentry's error-focused approach. If you're already on Datadog for full-stack observability, their MCP server is the natural choice. If you're specifically focused on error tracking and debugging, Sentry's server is deeper in that niche.

**PagerDuty MCP Server:** Focused on incident management rather than debugging — acknowledging alerts, escalating issues, coordinating response. Complements Sentry rather than replacing it.

**Grafana MCP:** Dashboard visualization and metrics/traces/logs queries. A different layer of the observability stack. You might use Grafana MCP for monitoring dashboards and Sentry MCP for drilling into specific errors.

**Honeycomb MCP:** Event-based observability with natural language querying. Similar AI-powered query translation, different observability paradigm.

The observability MCP space is maturing fast — most major platforms now have official MCP servers. The choice depends on which observability platform you already use, not which MCP server is better in isolation.

## Who Should Use This

**Use the Sentry MCP server if:**
- You already use Sentry Cloud for error tracking
- Your coding agent workflow involves investigating production errors
- You want OAuth authentication rather than API tokens on disk
- You want AI-powered root cause analysis (Seer) integrated into your debugging flow

**Skip it (for now) if:**
- You use Sentry but only self-hosted — the best features (OAuth, Seer) may not be available
- You need cross-project investigation for microservice debugging
- You're not already a Sentry user — this server doesn't replace Sentry, it extends it
- You need a stable, production-grade integration — v0.29.0 is still rough

{{< verdict rating="4" summary="First-party quality for Sentry users, with the rough edges you'd expect at v0.29" >}}
The Sentry MCP server is the best example we've reviewed of how a first-party MCP integration should work. OAuth 2.0 authentication, zero-install remote hosting, comprehensive tool coverage, and proprietary AI integration (Seer) set it apart from community alternatives and most official MCP servers we've tested. For developers who already use Sentry, this genuinely reduces the friction of debugging production errors from your IDE. The 4/5 rating reflects the gap between the vision and the current execution: 748+ GitHub issues, cross-project query limitations, AI search requiring a separate LLM key, and pre-1.0 instability mean you'll hit friction. But the foundation is strong, the team is actively shipping (29 versions and counting), and the OAuth + remote hosting pattern is something every MCP server should copy. This is what "first-party" should mean.
