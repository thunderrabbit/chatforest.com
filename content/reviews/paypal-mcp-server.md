**At a glance:** [GitHub](https://github.com/paypal/paypal-mcp-server) — 8 stars, 5 forks, JavaScript/TypeScript. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@paypal/mcp) — @paypal/mcp. Powered by [paypal/agent-toolkit](https://github.com/paypal/agent-toolkit) (181 stars, 104 forks). Official first-party from [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/). Apache 2.0 license. 30+ tools, local + remote server options.

The PayPal MCP Server is the **official first-party MCP integration** for [PayPal's](https://www.paypal.com/) payment platform. It provides AI assistants with access to the full range of PayPal commerce capabilities — invoicing, order management, subscriptions, disputes, shipment tracking, product catalog management, and analytics — enabling what PayPal calls "agentic commerce."

[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/) was founded in 1998 (as Confinity, later merging with Elon Musk's X.com in 2000). The company went public in 2002, was acquired by eBay for $1.5B, and spun off as an independent public company in 2015. As of 2025: ~24,000 employees, $33.2B annual revenue (4.3% YoY growth), ~$37-42B market cap. PayPal operates in 200+ countries with 400M+ active accounts.

**Architecture note:** The `paypal-mcp-server` repo (8 stars, 9 commits, 2 contributors) is a thin entry point. The real substance lives in `paypal/agent-toolkit` (181 stars, 168 commits, 11 contributors), which also supports OpenAI Agent SDK, LangChain, and Vercel AI SDK. This review focuses on the MCP server interface.

## Setup & Configuration

### Local Server (stdio)

Install and run via npx:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paypal": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@paypal/mcp", "--tools=all"],
      "env": {
        "PAYPAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your-access-token",
        "PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT": "SANDBOX"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Requires Node.js v18+.

### Remote Server (SSE / Streamable HTTP)

PayPal hosts its own remote MCP servers — no local installation needed:

| Environment | SSE Endpoint | HTTP Endpoint |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Sandbox** | `https://mcp.sandbox.paypal.com/sse` | `https://mcp.sandbox.paypal.com/http` |
| **Production** | `https://mcp.paypal.com/sse` | `https://mcp.paypal.com/http` |

Remote server configuration using `mcp-remote`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paypal": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.sandbox.paypal.com/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

The remote server uses OAuth 2.0 with a PayPal login redirect and supports restricted tool visibility based on token permissions.

### Authentication

| Method | When to Use |
|--------|------------|
| **Access Token** | Local server — generate via PayPal Developer Dashboard (Client ID + Secret → OAuth2 endpoint) |
| **OAuth 2.0 redirect** | Remote server — browser-based PayPal login |

Token validity: 3-8 hours (sandbox), 8 hours (production).

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `PAYPAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` | OAuth2 access token | (required for local) |
| `PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT` | `SANDBOX` or `PRODUCTION` | `SANDBOX` |

### Prerequisites

- **Sandbox:** PayPal Developer account (free)
- **Production:** PayPal Business account

### Supported Clients

Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf (available in Windsurf MCP Store since July 2025), and any MCP-compatible client.

## Development Timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| **Apr 2, 2025** | Initial MCP server launch (invoicing focus) |
| **May 21, 2025** | OpenAI LLM compatibility added |
| **Jun 2, 2025** | All agent-toolkit tools exposed on remote server |
| **Jun 13, 2025** | Streamable HTTP transport added |
| **Jun 16, 2025** | Subscription and refund tools added |
| **Jul 2, 2025** | Gift card commerce tools (search, cart, checkout) |
| **Jul 16, 2025** | Windsurf MCP Store integration |
| **Sep 15, 2025** | Agent toolkit v1.8.0 release |

PayPal was notably **early to market** with a hosted remote MCP server. As AlleyCorp partner Kenneth Auchenberg observed: *"Wait, PayPal shipped a remote MCP server, before Stripe?"* — highlighting PayPal's unusual first-mover advantage in this space.

## Pricing

The **MCP server itself is free** (Apache 2.0). Standard PayPal transaction fees apply to all processed payments:

| Fee Type | Rate |
|----------|------|
| **Domestic transactions** | 2.99% + fixed fee |
| **International transactions** | Higher percentage + currency conversion |
| **Invoicing** | 2.99% + fixed fee when paid |
| **Subscriptions** | Standard transaction fee per billing cycle |
| **Disputes/chargebacks** | $20 fee (waived in some cases) |

No additional API or MCP-specific fees. The remote hosted server is free to use.

## Comparison with Alternatives

| Feature | PayPal MCP (Official) | DynamicEndpoints PayPal | CData PayPal MCP | Stripe MCP |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Official** | Yes (first-party) | Community | Community | Yes (first-party) |
| **Focus** | Full commerce (30+ tools) | Orders, payouts, invoicing | Read-only data access | Payments, billing, customers |
| **Tools** | 30+ | ~15 | Read-only queries | 20+ |
| **Remote server** | Yes (SSE + HTTP) | No | No | Yes |
| **Auth** | OAuth 2.0, access token | Access token | JDBC credentials | API key |
| **Transport** | stdio, SSE, Streamable HTTP | stdio | stdio | stdio, HTTP |
| **Stars** | 8 (MCP) / 181 (toolkit) | Low | Low | 1,400 |
| **License** | Apache 2.0 | Varies | Proprietary | MIT |

**PayPal MCP vs Stripe MCP:** Stripe's AI toolkit (`stripe/ai`) has significantly more community traction — 1,400 stars vs PayPal's 181 (toolkit) or 8 (MCP server). However, PayPal beat Stripe to market with a hosted remote MCP server and offers broader commerce capabilities (invoicing with QR codes, subscriptions, disputes, shipment tracking, gift card commerce). Stripe's server focuses more narrowly on payment processing and billing. The choice depends on which payment platform your business already uses.

**PayPal MCP vs community alternatives:** The official server's advantages are clear: 30+ tools, remote hosting, OAuth 2.0, active development with regular feature additions. Community alternatives like DynamicEndpoints' server or CData's read-only connector serve narrower use cases.

## Known Issues

1. **Minimal MCP server repo** — The `paypal-mcp-server` repo has only 9 commits and 2 contributors. The real work is in `agent-toolkit`, which can create confusion about where to report issues or look for documentation
2. **Token expiration** — Access tokens expire after 3-8 hours, requiring regeneration. No built-in token refresh mechanism in the local server — developers must manage token lifecycle themselves
3. **Invoice creation bugs** — Open issue (#40 in agent-toolkit) reports problems with the `create_invoice` tool via MCP, suggesting the MCP layer may not perfectly map to the underlying API
4. **LLM tool hallucination** — Closed issue (#44) documented LLMs trying to call tools that don't exist (like `list_orders`), indicating that tool naming may not be fully intuitive to AI models
5. **API domain format** — Open issue (#43) notes the API domain should use `api-m` format, suggesting potential connectivity issues in some configurations
6. **AI output disclaimer** — PayPal explicitly warns that AI-generated outputs "may be inaccurate or incomplete." For financial transactions, this means human review of AI-initiated actions is essential
7. **OAuth identity gap** — Security researchers note that PKCE ensures exchange integrity but doesn't prove who is making the request. AI agents have no legal identity, raising questions about accountability for automated financial transactions
8. **Gift card commerce requires feature flag** — The commerce tools (search, cart, checkout) require a special `x-feature-flags: commerce:true` header, suggesting they're still in limited availability
9. **Low moderation** — Several spam-like issues in the GitHub tracker suggest limited issue triage, which may affect developer experience when seeking support

## The Bottom Line

**Rating: 3.5 out of 5**

The PayPal MCP Server earns credit for being **official first-party from a $33B+ revenue payment giant**, offering a **genuinely broad tool set** (30+ tools across invoicing, payments, subscriptions, disputes, shipping, catalog, analytics, and commerce), and providing **both local and remote server options** — PayPal was notably early to market with a hosted remote MCP server featuring SSE and Streamable HTTP transports. The active development cadence with regular feature additions throughout 2025 shows genuine investment in the agentic commerce space.

It loses points for the **split architecture confusion** (the MCP server repo has just 8 stars and 9 commits — the real work lives in agent-toolkit), **token management friction** (3-8 hour expiration with no built-in refresh), **open bugs in core tools** like invoice creation, and **significantly less community traction than Stripe's equivalent** (181 stars vs 1,400). The identity and accountability questions around AI agents processing financial transactions remain unresolved across the industry, but they're particularly pointed for a payment platform.

For merchants and developers already on PayPal, this MCP server enables AI-assisted commerce workflows that go well beyond simple payment processing — subscription management, dispute handling, shipment tracking, and analytics are all accessible through natural language. The remote server option eliminates infrastructure overhead entirely. If you're evaluating payment MCP servers, compare this with Stripe's offering based on which platform your business already uses. For new integrations, Stripe's larger community and more mature ecosystem may be the safer bet, but PayPal's broader tool coverage and remote hosting are genuine differentiators.
