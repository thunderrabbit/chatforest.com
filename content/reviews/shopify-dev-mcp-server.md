**At a glance:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Shopify/dev-mcp) — 488 stars, TypeScript, 8 tools, stdio transport. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/dev-mcp) — @shopify/dev-mcp v1.7.0, 46.3K downloads. Official first-party from [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/). No authentication required.

The Shopify Dev MCP server is the **official first-party MCP integration** for developers building on the [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) platform. It gives AI assistants deep knowledge of Shopify's APIs, documentation, and development patterns — enabling them to search docs, explore GraphQL schemas, validate code, and provide accurate guidance based on current APIs and best practices.

[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) was founded in 2006 by Tobias Lütke, Daniel Weinand, and Scott Lake. The company powers e-commerce for millions of merchants worldwide. As of 2025: ~8,100 employees, $11.56B annual revenue (up 30% YoY), ~$157B market cap. Shopify is publicly traded on NYSE (SHOP) and TSX. The Dev MCP server launched as part of Shopify's **Winter '26 Edition**, which positions AI as central to the Shopify developer experience — "AI-native, developer-ready" is the edition's tagline.

Beyond the Dev MCP server, Shopify also offers **Storefront MCP** and **Customer Accounts MCP** servers for building AI-powered shopping experiences. This review covers all three.

## What It Does

### Dev MCP Server (8 tools — Developer Workflow)

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `learn_shopify_api` | Teaches the AI about supported Shopify APIs and how to use the MCP server's tools effectively |
| `search_docs_chunks` | Searches shopify.dev documentation across multiple topics |
| `fetch_full_docs` | Retrieves complete documentation pages for specific paths |
| `introspect_graphql_schema` | Explores GraphQL types, queries, and mutations across Shopify APIs |
| `validate_graphql_codeblocks` | Validates GraphQL code against Shopify schemas for correctness |
| `validate_component_codeblocks` | Validates JavaScript/TypeScript Shopify component code |
| `validate_theme_codeblocks` | Checks individual Liquid template files (self-contained) |
| `validate_theme` | Validates entire theme directories using Shopify's Theme Check linter |

The Dev MCP server connects your AI coding assistant to Shopify's full development knowledge base. Instead of the AI relying on potentially outdated training data, it can query live documentation, introspect actual GraphQL schemas, and validate generated code before you run it. It covers:

- **Admin GraphQL API** — product management, orders, customers, metafields
- **Storefront API** — headless commerce queries
- **Customer Account API** — authenticated customer operations
- **Functions** — Shopify's serverless extension system
- **Liquid** — theme templating language
- **Polaris Web Components** — Shopify's UI component library
- **POS UI Extensions** — point-of-sale interfaces
- **Partner API** — app and partner management

### Storefront MCP Server (4 tools — AI Shopping)

Shopify's Storefront MCP server enables AI agents to act as shopping assistants for specific stores:

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `search_shop_catalog` | Searches a store's product inventory with contextual results |
| `search_shop_policies_and_faqs` | Answers questions about store policies, shipping, returns |
| `get_cart` | Retrieves current cart contents including checkout URL |
| `update_cart` | Adds, removes, or updates cart items; creates new carts |

**Endpoint:** `https://{shop}.myshopify.com/api/mcp` — no authentication required. Each store has its own endpoint. This is designed for building customer-facing AI shopping assistants that can search products, manage carts, and guide customers through checkout.

### Customer Accounts MCP Server (order/returns management)

The Customer Accounts MCP server handles authenticated customer operations:

- Order tracking and status
- Return management
- Account information access

**Endpoint:** `https://{shop}/customer/api/mcp` — requires **OAuth 2.0 with PKCE** authentication. Stores must have custom domains configured and Level 2 protected customer data (PII) access approved. Tools are discovered dynamically via the `tools/list` command.

## Setup & Configuration

### Dev MCP Server

The server requires no authentication and runs locally via npx. Node.js 18+ is the only prerequisite.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shopify-dev": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@shopify/dev-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add shopify-dev -- npx -y @shopify/dev-mcp@latest
```

**Codex CLI** (TOML config):

```toml
[mcp_servers.shopify-dev]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@shopify/dev-mcp@latest"]
```

### Storefront MCP Server

No installation — it's a remote HTTP endpoint hosted by Shopify:

```
https://{shop}.myshopify.com/api/mcp
```

Replace `{shop}` with the store's subdomain. No authentication needed.

### Supported AI Clients

Dev MCP: Cursor, Claude Desktop, Claude Code, VS Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, Windsurf, Warp, ChatGPT, OpenAI Agents SDK.

Storefront MCP: Any MCP client that supports HTTP/SSE transport.

### Configuration Options

- **Disable telemetry:** Set `OPT_OUT_INSTRUMENTATION=true` environment variable
- **Liquid validation mode:** Set `LIQUID_VALIDATION_MODE` to `full` (default, recommended) or `partial`

## Development History

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| March 31, 2025 | @shopify/dev-mcp first published on npm |
| Winter '26 Edition | Storefront MCP and Customer Accounts MCP launched |
| March 22, 2026 | v1.7.0 released (latest as of review) |
| Ongoing | 488 GitHub stars, 46.3K npm downloads, 15 npm releases over ~12 months |

The Dev MCP server has evolved rapidly from initial release to v1.7.0, adding GraphQL validation, component validation, and full theme validation capabilities. Shopify's commitment is evident in the Winter '26 Edition positioning, which makes MCP central to their developer tooling strategy.

## Pricing Impact

The **Dev MCP server is completely free** with no usage limits — it searches documentation and validates code locally.

The **Storefront MCP server is free** to call against any Shopify store's public endpoint, but building apps that use it requires a [Shopify app](https://shopify.dev/) registration.

For merchants considering the Storefront MCP for AI shopping assistants, **Shopify platform pricing** applies:

| Plan | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Basic** | $39/mo | Online store, basic reports |
| **Shopify** | $105/mo | Professional reports, 5 staff accounts |
| **Advanced** | $399/mo | Custom reports, 15 staff accounts |
| **Plus** | From $2,300/mo | Enterprise features, dedicated support |

Storefront API calls follow Shopify's standard [API rate limits](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/rate-limits) (no additional MCP-specific charges).

## Comparison with Alternatives

| Feature | Shopify Dev MCP | WooCommerce MCP | BigCommerce MCP | Magento/Adobe MCP |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Official** | Yes (first-party) | Yes (developer preview) | Beta (in development) | No (community only) |
| **Focus** | Dev docs + code validation | Store operations (CRUD) | Store operations | N/A |
| **Tools** | 8 (dev) + 4 (storefront) + customer accounts | Store management via REST | Products, orders, customers | Varies |
| **Auth** | None (dev) / None (storefront) / OAuth (customer) | OAuth + local proxy | API key | Varies |
| **Transport** | stdio (dev) / HTTP (storefront) | stdio via proxy | stdio | Varies |
| **GraphQL introspection** | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Code validation** | Yes (GraphQL, components, Liquid, themes) | No | No | No |
| **AI shopping assistant** | Yes (Storefront MCP) | No | Planned | No |
| **Platform** | Shopify (hosted) | WordPress (self-hosted) | BigCommerce (hosted) | Adobe Commerce |

**Shopify Dev MCP vs WooCommerce MCP:** These serve completely different purposes. Shopify Dev MCP helps developers *build* on the platform — searching docs, exploring schemas, validating code. WooCommerce's MCP (developer preview) provides store *operations* — managing products, orders, customers via REST API. WooCommerce has no equivalent to Shopify's code validation or schema introspection.

**Shopify Storefront MCP vs BigCommerce Storefront MCP:** BigCommerce's Storefront MCP is still in beta (launching end of September). Shopify's is live and production-ready with catalog search, cart management, and policy lookup. BigCommerce is playing catch-up in the AI commerce space.

**Unique advantage:** Shopify is the only e-commerce platform offering a **three-server MCP architecture** — one for developers (building), one for shoppers (browsing/buying), and one for customers (order management). This separation of concerns is architecturally sound and enables focused, purpose-built tools for each audience.

## Known Issues

1. **Dev MCP is read-only** — The Dev MCP server only searches docs, introspects schemas, and validates code. It cannot create products, manage orders, or perform any store operations. For that, you need the Storefront MCP or a community server like [shopify-mcp](https://github.com/GeLi2001/shopify-mcp) by GeLi2001
2. **Storefront MCP is limited to 4 tools** — Catalog search, policies, get cart, update cart. No checkout completion, no payment processing, no order creation. The AI can add items to cart and provide a checkout URL, but the customer completes checkout in the browser
3. **Customer Accounts MCP requires complex setup** — OAuth 2.0 with PKCE, custom domain, Level 2 PII access approval, TOML configuration. Significantly more friction than the zero-auth Dev and Storefront servers
4. **No Admin API MCP** — There's no official MCP server for store management operations (creating products, managing inventory, processing orders). This gap is filled by community servers like [shopify-mcp](https://github.com/GeLi2001/shopify-mcp) (429 stars) and [shopify-mcp-server](https://github.com/amir-bengherbi/shopify-mcp-server)
5. **Telemetry enabled by default** — The Dev MCP server sends instrumentation data unless you explicitly opt out with `OPT_OUT_INSTRUMENTATION=true`
6. **npm-only distribution** — No Docker image, no Homebrew formula, no standalone binary. Requires Node.js 18+ and npx
7. **Storefront MCP varies by store** — Each store's endpoint only exposes that store's catalog and policies. Multi-store operations require separate connections
8. **No offline mode** — Dev MCP fetches live documentation from shopify.dev; no cached/offline fallback for air-gapped environments

## The Bottom Line

**Rating: 4 out of 5**

The Shopify Dev MCP server earns its rating through **official first-party backing from the largest e-commerce platform** ($11.56B revenue, millions of merchants), a **unique three-server architecture** that cleanly separates developer, shopper, and customer use cases, and **code validation capabilities** that no competing e-commerce MCP server offers. The zero-auth, npx-based setup means any Shopify developer can be productive in seconds.

It loses a point for the **absence of an Admin API MCP server** (the biggest gap — no official way to manage store data via MCP), the **limited Storefront MCP** (4 tools, no checkout completion), and the **complex Customer Accounts setup** (OAuth + PKCE + PII approval). The Dev MCP is also strictly read-only — it helps you write code but can't execute operations against a store.

For Shopify developers, the Dev MCP server is essential — it transforms your AI assistant from guessing at Shopify APIs to working with live, validated schemas and docs. For merchants exploring AI shopping assistants, the Storefront MCP provides a production-ready foundation, though you'll need to build the surrounding app yourself. The biggest missing piece is an official Admin API MCP server for store management — until Shopify fills that gap, community servers remain necessary.
