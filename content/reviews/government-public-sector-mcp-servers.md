card_description: "Government and public sector MCP servers for official data, legislation, procurement, census, tax, elections, and civic technology. This is one of the most significant categories in the MCP ecosystem — five government agencies have released official MCP servers, making it the most institutionally-adopted vertical. The U.S. Government Publishing Office's GovInfo MCP (public preview) is the first official federal MCP server, providing certified access to bills, laws, regulations, and the Federal Register. The U.S. Census Bureau's official MCP server (34 stars) offers 3 tools with PostgreSQL caching for ACS, Decennial, and Economic Census data. France's datagouv/datagouv-mcp (85 stars, MIT) is the most-starred official government MCP server, with a public hosted instance at mcp.data.gouv.fr. India's NSO eSankhyiki MCP provides 7 datasets from the Ministry of Statistics via FastMCP 3.0. GSA-TTS built a USASpending.gov demo with login.gov OIDC authentication. On the community side, lzinga/us-gov-open-data-mcp is a standout with 188+ tools spanning 36+ government APIs — Treasury, FRED, Congress, FDA, CDC, FEC, lobbying, housing, patents, OSHA, and more. Hack23/European-Parliament-MCP-Server (61 tools, Apache-2.0) is the most sophisticated parliamentary MCP server, featuring OSINT intelligence with MEP influence scoring, coalition analysis, and voting anomaly detection across 1,130+ unit tests. For U.S. legislation, sh-patterson/legiscan-mcp covers all 50 states plus Congress with 90% API usage reduction via batching, while amurshak/congressMCP offers 92 operations with a hosted service. Government procurement is well-covered: blencorp/capture-mcp-server integrates SAM.gov and USASpending.gov, GovTribe offers commercial GovCon intelligence, and procurement portals from India, Turkey, and Ukraine are available. Tax tools include dma9527/irs-taxpayer-mcp with 39 tools covering federal/state calculations through TY2025. Notable gaps: no official MCP servers from UK, Germany, Australia, or most G20 nations; no municipal/city services platforms (311 systems, utilities, permits); no voting/elections administration (only campaign finance); no social services (benefits, unemployment, welfare); no immigration/visa processing; no public transportation/transit; no emergency management/FEMA; no public education data. The category earns 4.0/5 — institutional adoption by five government agencies is remarkable for a protocol this young, the legislative and procurement coverage is comprehensive, and the existence of mega-aggregators like the 188-tool US government server demonstrates real utility. The international coverage beyond the US/France/India is still thin."

Government MCP servers are connecting AI agents to official data, legislation, procurement systems, and civic infrastructure. Instead of manually navigating government portals, downloading CSV files, or parsing complex API documentation, these servers let AI assistants query census data, track legislation across 50 states, search federal contracts, calculate taxes, analyze campaign finance, and access open data portals — all through the Model Context Protocol.

The landscape spans eight areas: **official agency servers** (GovInfo, Census Bureau, India NSO, France data.gouv.fr, GSA), **mega-aggregators** (multi-API collections spanning dozens of federal data sources), **legislative & congressional** (bill tracking, voting records, parliamentary intelligence), **census & demographics** (population data, statistical analysis), **open data portals** (Data.gov, Socrata, international equivalents), **government procurement** (contracts, spending, tenders), **tax & revenue** (IRS calculations, compliance), and **elections & campaign finance** (FEC data, political research).

The headline findings: **Five government agencies have released official MCP servers** — more institutional adoption than any other vertical category. **The U.S. has the deepest coverage** — from official Census Bureau and GPO servers to a community mega-aggregator with 188+ tools across 36 APIs. **Legislative tracking is remarkably complete** — LegiScan covers all 50 states, and the European Parliament server includes OSINT-grade political intelligence. **Procurement is surprisingly international** — servers exist for U.S., Indian, Turkish, and Ukrainian government contracts. **The biggest gap is municipal services** — no city-level 311 systems, utility management, or local government portals have MCP implementations.

## Official Government Agency Servers

### GovInfo MCP — U.S. Government Publishing Office

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [U.S. GPO GovInfo MCP](https://www.govinfo.gov/features/mcp-public-preview) | — | TypeScript | Government | Multiple |

The **first official U.S. federal MCP server**, released as a public preview by the Government Publishing Office. GovInfo is the world's only GPO-certified trustworthy digital repository for U.S. government documents, providing AI access to:

- **Bills and laws** — full text of introduced, enrolled, and enacted legislation
- **Federal Register** — proposed rules, final rules, notices, executive orders
- **Congressional reports** — committee reports, hearing transcripts, CRS reports
- **Code of Federal Regulations** — current regulatory text
- **Presidential documents** — executive orders, proclamations, memoranda

A community implementation by Travis-Prall/govinfo-mcp (~5 stars) also exists for those who want a lighter-weight alternative.

The significance here is institutional: a U.S. federal agency officially supporting the MCP protocol signals legitimacy that community-built wrappers cannot. For civic tech developers, policy researchers, and legal professionals, this is a direct pipeline from the authoritative source.

### U.S. Census Bureau Data API MCP

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [uscensusbureau/us-census-bureau-data-api-mcp](https://github.com/uscensusbureau/us-census-bureau-data-api-mcp) | ~34 | TypeScript | Government | 3 tools |

The **official Census Bureau MCP server** connects AI assistants with Census Data API through three core tools:

- **list-datasets** — discover available Census datasets
- **fetch-dataset-geography** — retrieve geographic hierarchies for datasets
- **fetch-aggregate-data** — pull aggregate statistics with geographic filtering

Uses PostgreSQL for local data caching, with Docker Compose setup for deployment. Covers American Community Survey (1-year and 5-year estimates), Decennial Census, Economic Census, and Population Estimates.

This is practical infrastructure: researchers and analysts who routinely query Census data can now do it conversationally instead of wrestling with the Census API's notoriously complex parameter structure.

### data.gouv.fr MCP — French Government

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [datagouv/datagouv-mcp](https://github.com/datagouv/datagouv-mcp) | ~85 | Python | MIT | Multiple |

## International Government

### Japan e-Stat MCP Servers

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [cygkichi/estat-mcp-server](https://github.com/cygkichi/estat-mcp-server) | ~3 | Python | — | Multiple |
| [ajtgjmdjp/estat-mcp](https://github.com/ajtgjmdjp/estat-mcp) | — | TypeScript | — | Multiple |

**Izyuusya/japan-data-mcp** adds Japanese regional data using e-Stat, National Tax Agency Corporate Number API, and Ministry of Land real estate data.

## What's Missing

The gaps reveal what official government technology priorities haven't reached yet:

- **Municipal/city services** — no 311 systems, no building permits, no utility management, no local government portals
- **Voting/elections administration** — only campaign finance exists; no voter registration, ballot tracking, or election results
- **Social services** — no benefits eligibility, unemployment insurance, welfare, or social security
- **Immigration/visa** — no visa processing, passport status, or immigration court data
- **Public transportation** — no transit APIs, no GTFS feeds through MCP
- **Emergency management** — no FEMA, no emergency alerts, no disaster response coordination
- **Public education** — no school district data, no education statistics beyond Census
- **Most G20 nations** — UK, Germany, Australia, South Korea, Brazil, and most major economies have no official MCP servers
- **Intergovernmental organizations** — no United Nations, World Bank, or IMF data via MCP (World Bank has excellent APIs that could be wrapped)

## The Bottom Line

**Rating: 4.0 out of 5** — Government and public sector MCP servers earn a strong rating on the strength of institutional adoption and comprehensive U.S. federal data coverage.

The standout fact: **five government agencies have released official MCP servers**. The U.S. Government Publishing Office, U.S. Census Bureau, India's Ministry of Statistics, France's national data platform, and GSA's Technology Transformation Services have all officially embraced MCP. No other vertical category has this level of institutional adoption.

The community ecosystem is equally impressive. The 188-tool US Government Open Data MCP server alone covers more federal data sources than many civic tech organizations access in total. The European Parliament MCP server's OSINT capabilities — influence scoring, voting anomaly detection, coalition analysis — represent some of the most sophisticated analytical tooling in the entire MCP ecosystem.

Procurement and legislative tracking are the practical winners. Government contractors can integrate SAM.gov and USASpending.gov data directly into AI workflows. Policy analysts can track legislation across all 50 states simultaneously. Tax professionals get 39 tools for federal and state calculations without sending data to external services.

The category loses a full point for international coverage — outside the U.S., France, India, Canada, and Japan, government MCP adoption is nearly nonexistent. The municipal gap is also significant: cities generate enormous amounts of public data through 311 systems, permit offices, and transit authorities, but none of it is accessible through MCP yet.

For civic technologists, policy researchers, government contractors, and anyone who regularly works with public data, this is one of the most practically useful categories in the MCP ecosystem.
