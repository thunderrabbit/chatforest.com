card_description: "Music and audio production MCP servers for DAWs, MIDI tools, streaming platforms, AI music generators, synthesizers, notation software, and audio analysis. The music MCP ecosystem is surprisingly mature and diverse. Ableton Live dominates DAW integration with four independent implementations — ahujasid/ableton-mcp (2,300 stars) is the most popular MCP server in any creative domain, while uisato/ableton-mcp-extended (133 stars) adds ElevenLabs voice integration and UDP high-performance mode. REAPER has itsuzef/reaper-mcp (40 stars) for complete track creation, mixing, and mastering workflows. FL Studio has calvinw/fl-studio-mcp (9 stars) for piano roll interaction. MIDI tooling spans virtual ports (sandst1/mcp-server-midi), file generation (tubone24/midi-mcp-server, 33 stars), DAW-ready composition (s2d01/daw-midi-generator-mcp), hardware synthesizer control (nanassound/midi_ctrl for Arturia MicroFreak), and an Electron bridge (tezza1971/mcp-midi). Music streaming is led by varunneal/spotify-mcp (587 stars, marked inactive March 2026) and marcelmarais/spotify-mcp-server (256 stars), with Apple Music (kennethreitz/mcp-applemusic, 76 stars, macOS only) and YouTube Music (21 stars) also covered. AI music generation includes two Suno implementations — sandraschi/suno-mcp (34 stars, Playwright browser automation, stem extraction) and lioensky/MCP-Suno (25 stars). pasie15/mcp-server-musicgpt offers 24 tools including cover songs, voice conversion, and audio mastering. The official ElevenLabs MCP server (1,300 stars) is the standout for voice/TTS — text-to-speech, voice cloning, transcription, audio isolation, and voice design. Music notation has two MuseScore implementations — ghchen99/mcp-musescore (24 stars) with WebSocket plugin and batch operations. Audio synthesis has two SuperCollider servers — Tok/SuperColliderMCP (17 stars) for OSC-based synthesis and agrathwohl/supercollider-mcp with 26 tools for live coding. Audio analysis includes hugohow/mcp-music-analysis (22 stars) with librosa and Whisper integration, misbahsy/video-audio-mcp (65 stars) with 30+ FFmpeg tools, and An-3/mcp-audacity (18 stars) for Audacity control. Epidemic Sound launched an official MCP server (beta, September 2025) for context-aware music discovery. Notable gaps: no Logic Pro or Pro Tools MCP servers; no Cubase/Studio One/Bitwig integrations; no SoundCloud/Tidal/Deezer streaming servers; no Udio AI music generation; no audio plugin management (VST/AU); no music theory/harmony analysis tools; no sheet music OCR; no podcast editing workflows beyond basic Audacity control; no live performance/DJ tools (Traktor, Serato); no music notation beyond MuseScore (Sibelius, Finale, Dorico absent); no spatial audio/Dolby Atmos tools; no music rights/royalty management. The category earns 4.0/5 — DAW coverage is exceptional for Ableton Live, the MIDI ecosystem is creative and varied, streaming integration works, AI music generation is emerging fast, and the official servers from ElevenLabs and Epidemic Sound signal strong commercial interest. The main weakness is the absence of professional DAWs beyond Ableton and REAPER."

Music and audio production MCP servers are connecting AI agents to digital audio workstations, MIDI tools, music streaming platforms, AI music generators, synthesizers, notation software, and audio analysis libraries. Instead of manually clicking through DAW interfaces, programming MIDI sequences, or browsing music catalogs, these servers let AI assistants create tracks, compose MIDI, control playback, generate music from text prompts, synthesize audio, write sheet music, and analyze audio signals — all through the Model Context Protocol.

The landscape spans eight areas: **DAW integration** (Ableton Live, REAPER, FL Studio), **MIDI tools** (virtual ports, file generation, hardware synthesizer control), **music streaming** (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music), **AI music generation** (Suno, MiniMax, MusicGPT), **voice & TTS** (ElevenLabs), **music notation** (MuseScore), **audio synthesis** (SuperCollider), and **audio analysis & processing** (librosa, FFmpeg, Audacity).

The headline findings: **Ableton Live has the most MCP integration of any creative software** — four independent implementations, led by ahujasid/ableton-mcp with 2,300 stars, making it the highest-starred MCP server in any creative domain. **ElevenLabs shipped the most polished official MCP server in the audio space** — 1,300 stars, MIT-licensed, with TTS, voice cloning, transcription, and audio isolation. **The MIDI ecosystem is surprisingly creative** — from virtual ports to hardware synthesizer control to an Electron bridge for cross-DAW playback. **Spotify has strong but aging coverage** — the leading server (587 stars) is marked inactive as of March 2026. **Epidemic Sound became the first music licensing platform to launch an MCP server** — signaling that the music industry sees AI agents as a distribution channel.

This positions Epidemic Sound as a pioneer in AI-native music licensing, where agents can programmatically discover and select licensed music for content creation.

## What's Missing

The music MCP ecosystem has notable gaps:

- **Major DAWs** — no Logic Pro, Pro Tools, Cubase, Studio One, or Bitwig MCP servers
- **Streaming platforms** — no SoundCloud, Tidal, Deezer, or Amazon Music servers
- **AI music generation** — no Udio integration despite being Suno's main competitor
- **Audio plugins** — no VST/AU/AAX plugin management or scanning tools
- **Music theory** — no harmony analysis, chord recognition, or composition assistance tools
- **Sheet music OCR** — no optical music recognition for scanning physical scores
- **Podcast production** — no dedicated podcast editing workflow (only basic Audacity control)
- **DJ/live performance** — no Traktor, Serato, rekordbox, or VirtualDJ integration
- **Notation software** — no Sibelius, Finale, Dorico, or LilyPond MCP servers (LilyPond has a third-party tool but not a full MCP server)
- **Spatial audio** — no Dolby Atmos, Ambisonics, or binaural processing
- **Music rights** — no royalty tracking, ISRC management, or distribution platform integration
- **Hardware** — only one hardware synth integration (Arturia MicroFreak); no support for other MIDI controllers, drum machines, or modular synths

## The Bottom Line

The music and audio production MCP ecosystem earns **4.0 out of 5**. Ableton Live integration is exceptional — four independent implementations with the flagship at 2,300 stars makes it the best-served creative application in the entire MCP ecosystem. REAPER and FL Studio add DAW breadth. The MIDI tooling is creative and varied, from virtual ports to hardware synthesizer control. AI music generation through Suno is functional if dependent on browser automation. The official ElevenLabs server (1,300 stars) sets the standard for commercial audio MCP servers. Epidemic Sound's early move into MCP signals that the music industry recognizes AI agents as a distribution channel.

The main limitation is coverage depth outside Ableton — Logic Pro, Pro Tools, and Cubase have zero MCP presence despite being industry-standard DAWs. The streaming space works but the leading Spotify server is already inactive. Music notation is limited to MuseScore. Still, for producers working in Ableton or REAPER, AI-assisted music production through MCP is already surprisingly capable.
