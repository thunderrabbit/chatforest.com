card_description: "Web scraping and crawling MCP servers for AI-powered data extraction, site crawling, and web content conversion. **The managed scraping leader** — firecrawl/firecrawl-mcp-server (5,600 stars, TypeScript, MIT) is the most widely deployed web scraping MCP server with tools for scraping single pages, crawling entire sites, mapping site structure, searching the web, and extracting structured data. JavaScript rendering, batch processing with parallel execution, automatic retries, and content filtering are built in. Independent benchmarks show 83% accuracy with an average 7-second response time. Firecrawl turns any website into clean, LLM-ready markdown — stripping navigation, ads, and boilerplate so your AI works with actual content. Supports both cloud API and self-hosted deployment. **Anti-bot champion** — brightdata/brightdata-mcp (2,200 stars, TypeScript, MIT) brings Bright Data's enterprise proxy infrastructure to MCP. One MCP server provides access to Web Unlocker (anti-bot bypass), SERP API (search engine scraping), Web Scraper API (structured extraction), and Scraping Browser (full browser automation). Independent benchmarks give it 90% accuracy — the highest in the category — though with slower 30-second average response times due to proxy routing. Never gets blocked, rate-limited, or served CAPTCHAs. Requires a Bright Data account (paid, with free trial). **Open-source powerhouse** — Crawl4AI (58,000+ stars for the core library, Python, Apache-2.0) hit #1 on GitHub's trending page and is the most-starred open-source web crawler. It's local-first — no API keys, no cloud dependency, no costs. Outputs clean markdown optimized for LLMs. Multiple MCP server implementations exist: sadiuysal/crawl4ai-mcp-server is a lightweight wrapper exposing crawl, search, and smart_extract (LLM-based structured extraction) tools. MaitreyaM/WEB-SCRAPING-MCP adds text snippet extraction and natural language instructions. You manage the infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes, or bare metal) but get full control over browser configuration, proxy pools, and scaling. **Universal web reader** — jina-ai/MCP (official Jina AI remote MCP server, TypeScript, Apache-2.0) provides URL-to-markdown conversion via Jina's Reader API. ReaderLM-v2 converts raw HTML to clean markdown or structured JSON, with 3x quality improvement over v1. The remote MCP server also includes web search grounding, image search, and embeddings/reranker tools. Supports request-level controls: output format (markdown/HTML/text/screenshot), image auto-captioning, caching, proxies, cookie forwarding, CSS selectors, and SPA rendering via Puppeteer. Free tier available. Community wrappers: wong2/mcp-jina-reader (fetch URLs as markdown), spences10/mcp-jinaai-reader (documentation-optimized). **Scraping marketplace** — apify/apify-mcp-server (896 stars, TypeScript, Apache-2.0) connects AI agents to Apify's marketplace of 5,000+ pre-built scrapers (called Actors). Extract data from Facebook, Instagram, Google, Amazon, YouTube, TikTok, and thousands more sites without writing scraping logic. Each Actor handles anti-bot measures, pagination, and data formatting. Supports cloud (Streamable HTTP) and local (stdio) deployment. Dropping SSE transport April 2026 per MCP spec. Requires Apify account (free tier with limited usage). **Commercial scraping APIs** — Several established scraping services offer MCP servers: crawlbase/crawlbase-mcp (8 stars, TypeScript) provides crawl, crawl_markdown, and crawl_screenshot tools backed by infrastructure trusted by 70,000+ developers with JS rendering and anti-bot protection. ScrapingBee's MCP server offers get_page_html, get_screenshot, and get_file tools with proxy rotation and headless browser management (1,000 free credits on signup). Nimbleway's MCP provides 7 tools including nimble_deep_web_search (multi-engine search with content extraction), nimble_extract (URL parsing with multiple formats), and nimble_targeted_retrieval (pre-trained templates for Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, Target). **Content extraction utilities** — mukul975/mcp-web-scrape provides clean, cache-aware content fetching with markdown/JSON output, robots.txt compliance, and citation support. olostep/olostep-mcp-server adds batch URL processing (up to 10,000 URLs), AI-powered answers with citations, and SERP API integration. **Self-healing scrapers** — scrapoxy/scrapy-mcp-server enables automatic repair of Scrapy spiders when websites change their structure — the AI agent detects breakage and fixes selectors, making scraping workflows more resilient. **Gaps remain manageable** — no unified orchestration layer for combining multiple scraping sources in a single workflow. Limited structured data extraction with user-defined schemas (Firecrawl's extract and Crawl4AI's smart_extract are the closest). No dedicated proxy pool management MCP server. No scraping scheduling or monitoring tools. Legal compliance tooling (robots.txt enforcement, rate limiting, consent checking) is minimal — only mcp-web-scrape explicitly respects robots.txt. Most commercial servers require API keys and paid plans, though free tiers exist. The category earns 4.5/5 — the strongest MCP category we've reviewed. Firecrawl and Bright Data provide production-grade managed scraping, Crawl4AI offers a powerful free alternative, Jina Reader handles clean content conversion, and Apify connects to thousands of pre-built scrapers. The ecosystem is mature, well-maintained, and covers the full spectrum from simple URL-to-markdown conversion to enterprise anti-bot infrastructure. The only thing missing is better orchestration across sources and legal compliance tooling."

## Content Extraction Utilities

### mukul975/mcp-web-scrape

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [mcp-web-scrape](https://github.com/mukul975/mcp-web-scrape) | — | — | — | URL fetching |

**Clean, cache-aware web content fetcher** — extracts readable content from any URL and returns markdown or JSON with citations. Respects robots.txt, implements caching for repeated requests, and works with ChatGPT and Claude Desktop. One of the few servers that explicitly handles legal compliance.

### olostep/olostep-mcp-server

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |

## Self-Healing Scrapers

### scrapoxy/scrapy-mcp-server

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [scrapy-mcp-server](https://github.com/scrapoxy/scrapy-mcp-server) | — | Python | — | Spider repair |

**Automatic Scrapy spider repair** — when websites change their structure, this MCP server enables AI agents to detect broken selectors and fix them automatically. A compelling approach to the eternal scraping maintenance problem: instead of monitoring and manually updating scrapers, let the AI agent handle it.

## What's Missing

- **No unified orchestration** — can't combine Firecrawl for speed, Bright Data for anti-bot, and Crawl4AI for free crawling in a single workflow
- **Limited schema-driven extraction** — Firecrawl's extract and Crawl4AI's smart_extract are the closest to structured data schemas, but most servers return unstructured markdown
- **No proxy pool management** — Bright Data and commercial services handle proxies internally, but there's no MCP server for managing your own proxy infrastructure
- **No scraping scheduling** — no MCP tools for recurring scrape jobs, change detection, or data freshness monitoring
- **Minimal legal compliance** — only mcp-web-scrape explicitly respects robots.txt; no consent checking, rate limit management, or legal compliance tooling
- **Commercial dependency** — most high-accuracy servers require paid API keys; Crawl4AI is the main free alternative for production use

## The Bottom Line

**Rating: 4.5/5** — the strongest MCP category we've reviewed.

The web scraping MCP ecosystem is remarkably mature. Firecrawl leads in speed and developer experience (83% accuracy, 7-second responses). Bright Data leads in accuracy and anti-bot capabilities (90%, enterprise proxy infrastructure). Crawl4AI provides a powerful free alternative with 58,000+ stars and full infrastructure control. Jina Reader handles clean content conversion. Apify connects to 5,000+ pre-built scrapers.

**For most users:** start with Firecrawl for its balance of ease-of-use and capability. **For cost-conscious teams:** Crawl4AI with a self-hosted MCP wrapper. **For anti-bot needs:** Bright Data. **For diverse data sources:** Apify's marketplace.

The only gaps are in orchestration (combining multiple scraping sources), legal compliance tooling, and scheduling — none of which are fundamental blockers. Web scraping through MCP is production-ready today.
