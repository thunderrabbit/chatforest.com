card_description: "Science and research MCP servers for AI-powered academic paper search, scientific computing, bioinformatics, and research workflows. **arXiv MCP dominates academic search** — blazickjp/arxiv-mcp-server (2,400 stars, Apache-2.0, Python) is the most popular science MCP server with paper search, download, local storage, and systematic research analysis prompts. For broader coverage, openags/paper-search-mcp (796 stars, MIT) searches 7 sources simultaneously — arXiv, PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv, Google Scholar, IACR ePrint, and Semantic Scholar — with standardized output across all databases. benedict2310/Scientific-Papers-MCP (44 stars, TypeScript) covers 6 sources including OpenAlex (200M+ papers), PMC (7M+), Europe PMC (40M+), and CORE (200M+), with citation analysis and top-cited paper discovery. Multiple Semantic Scholar servers provide citation network exploration — JackKuo666/semanticscholar-MCP-Server (52 stars, MIT) offers paper/author/citation tools, while zongmin-yu's FastMCP implementation exposes 16 tools with year-range filtering and sorting. **mcp.science is the scientific computing hub** — pathintegral-institute/mcp.science (117 stars, MIT, Python) bundles 12+ specialized MCP servers under one umbrella: sandboxed Python execution, Materials Project database access, SSH remote execution, GPAW density-functional-theory calculations, Mathematica integration, Jupyter kernel interaction, web content fetching, and academic search. Install any server with a single `uvx mcp-science <name>` command. For symbolic mathematics, paraporoco/Wolfram-MCP (6 stars, MIT) provides 11 tools — calculate, solve equations, integrate, differentiate, simplify, factor, expand, matrix operations, statistics, and arbitrary Wolfram Language execution. Multiple Wolfram Alpha API servers (StoneDot, akalaric, cnosuke, Garoth, SecretiveShell) provide computational knowledge access without a local Mathematica installation. texra-ai/mcp-server-mathematica executes Mathematica code via wolframscript for verification workflows. **Bioinformatics gets serious coverage** — Augmented-Nature/UniProt-MCP-Server (18 stars, TypeScript) is the most comprehensive life sciences MCP server with 26 tools spanning protein analysis, comparative genomics, structural biology, systems biology, batch processing, and external database integration. Output formats include JSON, FASTA, XML, TSV, GFF, and GenBank. The companion PDB-MCP-Server (21 stars, JavaScript) provides Protein Data Bank access with structure search, download in multiple formats (PDB, mmCIF, mmTF, XML), and quality validation metrics (resolution, R-values, Ramachandran, clash scores). QuentinCody/uniprot-mcp-server adds BLAST sequence similarity search and cross-database mapping between UniProt, Ensembl, and PDB. bio-mcp provides standalone NCBI BLAST access. **Earth and space science gets lightweight coverage** — blake365/usgs-quakes-mcp provides USGS earthquake data with natural-language queries, while jezweb/nasa-mcp-server (8 stars, Python) covers APOD, Mars rovers, asteroids, Earth imagery, and NASA's media library with smart caching. These complement the dedicated Geospatial and Weather MCP categories we've reviewed separately. **Major gaps remain in lab infrastructure** — no electronic lab notebooks (eLabFTW, SciNote), no LIMS integration, no chemistry tools (RDKit, OpenBabel, ChemDraw), no genomics databases (NCBI GenBank, Ensembl), no physics simulation, no observatory data (SDSS, ESO), no clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov), no patent search, no research funding databases (NIH Reporter, NSF Awards), and no peer review or manuscript submission workflows. The category earns 3.5/5 — academic paper search is genuinely strong with the arXiv server at 2,400 stars and multi-source aggregators covering billions of papers. Scientific computing has a solid foundation through mcp.science's 12-server bundle. Bioinformatics is surprisingly well-served for protein science. But everything beyond search-and-compute is missing — the lab bench, the wet lab, the clinical trial, the grant application, and the publication pipeline have no MCP representation."

Science and research MCP servers let AI assistants search academic literature, run mathematical computations, query protein databases, and analyze citation networks. Instead of manually searching PubMed, downloading PDFs from arXiv, or writing Wolfram Language scripts, researchers can have AI agents do this through the Model Context Protocol.

This review covers the **science and research** vertical — academic paper search, scientific computing, bioinformatics, and research tools. For geospatial analysis, see our [Geospatial & Mapping review](/reviews/geospatial-mapping-mcp-servers/). For weather and climate data, see our [Weather & Climate review](/reviews/weather-climate-mcp-servers/). For healthcare applications, see our [Healthcare & Medical review](/reviews/healthcare-medical-mcp-servers/).

The headline findings: **arXiv MCP server has 2,400 stars** — the most popular science-specific MCP server. **paper-search-mcp aggregates 7 academic sources** into a single interface. **mcp.science bundles 12+ scientific computing servers** under one project. **UniProt MCP provides 26 bioinformatics tools** for protein science. **Lab infrastructure is completely absent** — no ELN, no LIMS, no chemistry tools.

## Scientific Computing

### pathintegral-institute/mcp.science (Computing Hub)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Servers |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| [mcp.science](https://github.com/pathintegral-institute/mcp.science) | 117 | Python | MIT | 12+ |

The **most ambitious scientific computing MCP project** — a collection of specialized servers under one umbrella:

- **Python Code Execution** — sandboxed environment with restricted stdlib for safe computation
- **Materials Project** — access to the materials science database
- **SSH Exec** — remote command execution with whitelisted validation
- **GPAW** — density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations for computational physics/chemistry
- **Mathematica-Check** — Mathematica integration for symbolic verification
- **Jupyter-Act** — interact with Jupyter kernels
- **Web Fetch** — fetch and process HTML/PDF/text content

### Wolfram Language & Mathematica

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [Wolfram-MCP](https://github.com/paraporoco/Wolfram-MCP) | 6 | Python | MIT | 11 |
| [mcp-server-mathematica](https://github.com/texra-ai/mcp-server-mathematica) | — | — | — | Multiple |

**Wolfram-MCP** provides 11 symbolic math tools via the Wolfram Language:

- `wolfram_calculate` — evaluate mathematical expressions
- `wolfram_solve` — solve algebraic and differential equations

Five separate Wolfram Alpha MCP implementations — all solving the same problem (connecting AI to Wolfram Alpha's computational knowledge engine) with slight API differences. No local Mathematica license needed — these use the Wolfram Alpha API, which has free and paid tiers.

### calculator-mcp-server

| Server | Language | License | Notes |
|--------|----------|---------|-------|
| [calculator-mcp-server](https://github.com/huhabla/calculator-mcp-server) | — | — | Symbolic math, statistics, matrix operations |

For users who don't need Wolfram's full power — provides advanced mathematical calculations including symbolic computation, statistical analysis, and matrix operations without external API dependencies.

## Bioinformatics & Life Sciences

### Augmented-Nature/UniProt-MCP-Server (Most Comprehensive)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [UniProt-MCP-Server](https://github.com/Augmented-Nature/Augmented-Nature-UniProt-MCP-Server) | 18 | TypeScript | — | 26 |

The **most comprehensive life sciences MCP server** — 26 tools across 6 categories:

- **Protein Analysis** (5 tools) — search, detailed info, gene lookup, sequences, features
- **Comparative Genomics** (4 tools) — comparison, homologs, orthologs, phylogenetics
- **Structural Biology** (4 tools) — 3D structures, domains, variants, composition
- **Systems Biology** (4 tools) — pathways, interactions, functional classification, localization
- **Batch Processing** (3 tools) — multi-protein processing, advanced filtering, taxonomic search
- **Data Integration** (3 tools) — external database links, literature, annotation quality

Supports JSON, FASTA, XML, TSV, GFF, and GenBank output formats. Docker deployment available. This is the kind of deep, domain-specific MCP server that makes AI genuinely useful for bench scientists — asking "what proteins interact with BRCA1 and are localized to the nucleus?" becomes a single tool call.

### Augmented-Nature/PDB-MCP-Server

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [PDB-MCP-Server](https://github.com/Augmented-Nature/PDB-MCP-Server) | 21 | JavaScript | — | 5 |

Access to the **Protein Data Bank** — the global repository of 3D structures for proteins, nucleic acids, and complex assemblies:

- `search_structures` — find structures by query
- `get_structure_info` — detailed metadata
- `download_structure` — retrieve in PDB, mmCIF, mmTF, or XML format
- `search_by_uniprot` — cross-reference from UniProt accession
- `get_structure_quality` — validation metrics (resolution, R-values, Ramachandran stats, clash scores, rotamer analysis)

Designed to complement the UniProt MCP server — together they cover the protein sequence-to-structure pipeline.

### Other Bioinformatics Servers

| Server | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| [uniprot-mcp-server](https://github.com/QuentinCody/uniprot-mcp-server) (QuentinCody) | BLAST sequence similarity search + cross-database mapping (UniProt/Ensembl/PDB) |
| [uniprot-mcp-server](https://github.com/TakumiY235/uniprot-mcp-server) (TakumiY235) | Lightweight protein function and sequence retrieval |
| bio-mcp BLAST | Standalone NCBI BLAST access |

QuentinCody's version is notable for **BLAST integration** — submit a protein sequence and find similar sequences across databases, with asynchronous job processing for long-running alignments.

## Earth & Space Science

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [usgs-quakes-mcp](https://github.com/blake365/usgs-quakes-mcp) | — | TypeScript | — | 2 |
| [nasa-mcp-server](https://github.com/jezweb/nasa-mcp-server) | 8 | Python | — | 12+ |

**USGS Earthquake server** provides `find-earthquakes` and `find-earthquake-details` — translating natural-language queries ("earthquakes over magnitude 5 in California last month") into USGS API calls.

**NASA MCP server** covers APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day), Mars rover photos (Curiosity, Perseverance, Opportunity, Spirit), asteroid tracking with hazard identification, Earth imagery, and NASA's media library. Smart caching (30 min for images, 10 min for dynamic data) and rate-limit awareness.

These complement our dedicated [Geospatial & Mapping](/reviews/geospatial-mapping-mcp-servers/) and [Weather & Climate](/reviews/weather-climate-mcp-servers/) reviews, which cover Earth observation and atmospheric data in depth.

## What's Missing

The gaps in science MCP servers reveal where AI-assisted research hasn't reached yet:

- **Electronic Lab Notebooks** — no eLabFTW, SciNote, or Benchling MCP integration. Experiment logging is still manual.
- **LIMS** — no Laboratory Information Management Systems connected to MCP. Sample tracking, instrument data, and quality control remain siloed.
- **Chemistry & Molecular Modeling** — no RDKit, OpenBabel, ChemDraw, or molecular dynamics tools. Computational chemistry beyond mcp.science's DFT is absent.
- **Genomics** — no NCBI GenBank, no Ensembl (beyond UniProt cross-references), no ENCODE, no genome browsers.
- **Physics Simulation** — no COMSOL, ANSYS, or OpenFOAM integration.
- **Observatory Data** — no SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey), no ESO, no Hubble/JWST archive access.
- **Clinical Trials** — no ClinicalTrials.gov search or registration tools.
- **Patent Search** — no Google Patents, USPTO, or EPO integration.
- **Research Funding** — no NIH Reporter, no NSF Awards, no grant search databases.
- **Peer Review & Publishing** — no manuscript submission, no reviewer assignment, no journal recommendation workflows.

## The Bottom Line

Science and research MCP servers are **strong for literature search and protein science, but thin everywhere else**.

The **arXiv MCP server at 2,400 stars** proves that researchers want AI-assisted paper discovery. The multi-source aggregators (paper-search-mcp covering 7 databases, Scientific-Papers-MCP covering 6 with 200M+ papers through CORE and OpenAlex) mean that literature review workflows are genuinely accelerated. Citation analysis through Semantic Scholar adds context to the raw search results.

**Scientific computing has a solid foundation** through mcp.science's 12-server bundle — particularly the DFT calculator for quantum chemistry and the Materials Project integration. Wolfram Language integration gives agents access to one of the most powerful symbolic computation engines available, though requiring a local license limits accessibility. The five Wolfram Alpha API servers provide a license-free alternative for computational knowledge queries.

**Bioinformatics punches above its weight** — the Augmented Nature team's UniProt (26 tools) and PDB (5 tools with quality validation) servers provide genuine research utility for protein scientists. The sequence-to-structure pipeline is well-covered, and BLAST integration enables homology search.

**Everything else is missing.** The wet lab, the chemistry bench, the genome sequencer, the telescope, the clinical trial, the grant application — none of these have MCP integration. Science is a vast domain, and MCP coverage barely scratches the surface beyond "search papers" and "do math."

**Rating: 3.5 out of 5** — academic paper search is excellent, scientific computing is solid, bioinformatics is surprisingly deep, but the absence of lab infrastructure, chemistry tools, genomics databases, and research workflow integration keeps this from a higher score. The arXiv server's 2,400 stars show strong demand; the ecosystem needs to follow that signal into the lab.
