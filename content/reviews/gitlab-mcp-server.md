**At a glance:** GitLab has both an **official built-in MCP server** (15 tools, Premium/Ultimate tier) and a thriving community ecosystem led by [zereight/gitlab-mcp](https://github.com/zereight/gitlab-mcp) (1.2k stars, 100+ tools). GitLab's official server was introduced as an experiment in **GitLab 18.3**, promoted to beta in **18.6**, and supports the 2025-03-26 and 2025-06-18 MCP protocol specifications as of **18.7**. It uses **OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration** — AI tools self-register and request authorization to access GitLab data. Community servers extend coverage with 80-100+ tools across merge requests, pipelines, issues, wikis, releases, and more. The Anthropic reference server (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-gitlab`) has been **archived** to `servers-archived` since GitLab's official server superseded it.

GitLab is a **$955M+ TTM revenue** public company (NASDAQ: GTLB) with a **~$4-5B market cap** and **2,700+ employees**. It serves as both a Git hosting platform and a complete DevSecOps platform with built-in CI/CD, container registry, security scanning, and more. GitLab is **not a member of the [Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)](https://aaif.io/)**, though it actively supports MCP integration through its Duo AI platform.

**Architecture note:** Unlike GitHub (where the official MCP server is a standalone Go binary with 21 toolsets and 28.2k stars), GitLab's official MCP capability is **built directly into the GitLab product** — no separate server to install. This is elegant but means you need a Premium or Ultimate subscription ($29+/user/month) to use it. Community servers work with any GitLab instance including the free tier and self-hosted. This is the **second review in our Developer Tools MCP category**.

## What's Available

### GitLab Built-in MCP Server (Official)

GitLab's **first-party MCP server**, built into the platform:

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Documentation | [GitLab MCP server docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo/model_context_protocol/mcp_server/) |
| Edition | Premium or Ultimate (GitLab.com, Self-Managed, Dedicated) |
| Transport | HTTP (recommended), stdio via `mcp-remote` (requires Node.js 20+) |
| Authentication | OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration |
| Introduced | GitLab 18.3 (experiment), 18.6 (beta) |

**15 MCP tools:**

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `get_mcp_server_version` | Returns current server version |
| `create_issue` | Creates a new issue in a GitLab project |
| `get_issue` | Retrieves detailed issue information |
| `create_merge_request` | Creates a merge request |
| `get_merge_request` | Retrieves detailed merge request information |
| `get_merge_request_commits` | Lists commits in a merge request |
| `get_merge_request_diffs` | Retrieves diffs for a merge request |
| `get_merge_request_pipelines` | Lists pipelines for a merge request |
| `get_pipeline_jobs` | Retrieves jobs for a CI/CD pipeline |
| `manage_pipeline` | List, create, update, retry, cancel, delete pipelines |
| `create_workitem_note` | Adds a comment to a work item |
| `get_workitem_notes` | Retrieves all comments for a work item |
| `search` | Searches across the GitLab instance |
| `search_labels` | Searches for labels in a project or group |
| `semantic_code_search` | Searches for relevant code snippets |

**Key differentiator:** Built directly into GitLab — no separate server to install, no API keys to manage, no Docker containers to run. OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration means AI tools self-register when they first connect. Supports both HTTP transport (direct connection) and stdio via `mcp-remote`. However, it requires Premium/Ultimate and currently has far fewer tools than community alternatives.

**Timeline:**
- GitLab 18.3 — Experimental release (feature flags, disabled by default)
- GitLab 18.6 — Promoted to beta, feature flags removed
- GitLab 18.7 — Added support for 2025-03-26 and 2025-06-18 MCP protocol specifications

### zereight/gitlab-mcp (Community Leader)

The **most popular community GitLab MCP server** with the most tools:

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| GitHub | [zereight/gitlab-mcp](https://github.com/zereight/gitlab-mcp) — 1.2k stars, 242 forks, 934 commits |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Transport | stdio, SSE, Streamable HTTP |
| Authentication | OAuth2, Personal Access Token, remote authorization |

**100+ MCP tools** across 11 categories:

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| Merge requests | 31 tools |
| Pipelines | 19 tools |
| Issues | 14 tools |
| Projects | 8 tools |
| Milestones | 9 tools |
| Repositories | 7 tools |
| Releases | 7 tools |
| Labels | 5 tools |
| Users | 5 tools |
| Wiki | 5 tools |
| Branches | 4 tools |

**Key differentiator:** The most comprehensive GitLab MCP server available — over **6x more tools** than GitLab's official server. Supports dynamic toolset configuration (enable/disable categories), read-only mode, Docker deployment, connection pooling for multiple GitLab instances, and multi-client support (Claude, Cursor, VS Code, GitHub Copilot). Works with any GitLab instance including the free tier.

### yoda-digital/mcp-gitlab-server

An **enterprise-focused** community server:

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| GitHub | [yoda-digital/mcp-gitlab-server](https://github.com/yoda-digital/mcp-gitlab-server) — 42 stars, 18 forks, 95 commits |
| Language | TypeScript (75.2%), JavaScript (23.6%) |
| License | MIT |
| Latest version | v0.3.1 |
| Transport | stdio, SSE |

**86 MCP tools** covering repository management, file operations, issue tracking, merge request lifecycle, CI/CD pipeline orchestration with job logs, wiki management (project and group), member and group administration, activity monitoring, label/milestone/protected branch configuration, and release management.

**Key differentiator:** Positions itself as "the most comprehensive MCP server for GitLab." Features built-in read-only mode, standardized pagination across all endpoints, and both stdio and SSE transports. Fewer stars than zereight but a clean, well-documented implementation.

### mcpland/gitlab-mcp

A **policy-controlled** GitLab MCP server with enterprise networking:

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| GitHub | [mcpland/gitlab-mcp](https://github.com/mcpland/gitlab-mcp) — 2 stars, 1 fork, 113 commits |
| Language | TypeScript |
| License | MIT |
| Transport | stdio, Streamable HTTP, SSE |

**80+ MCP tools** across 16 categories covering projects, repositories, merge requests, issues, pipelines, commits, labels, milestones, releases, wikis, uploads, GraphQL, users and groups, health checks, and more.

**Key differentiator:** The most enterprise-hardened option. Features a **policy engine** (read-only mode, tool allowlist/denylist, feature toggles, project-scoped restrictions), **enterprise networking** (HTTP/HTTPS proxy, custom CA certificates, Cloudflare bypass, multi-instance API rotation), and flexible authentication (PAT, OAuth 2.0 PKCE, external token scripts, token files, cookie-based auth, per-request remote authorization). Output in JSON, compact JSON, or YAML with configurable size limits.

### Reference Server — modelcontextprotocol/servers-archived

The **Anthropic reference implementation** for GitLab:

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Location | [modelcontextprotocol/servers-archived](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers-archived/tree/main/src/gitlab) |
| npm | `@modelcontextprotocol/server-gitlab` |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Released | November 2024 |
| Status | **Archived** |

Basic GitLab API integration with project management and file operations. **Archived** from the main `modelcontextprotocol/servers` repo. Historically served as the reference implementation but has been superseded by GitLab's built-in server and the richer community alternatives.

## Known Issues

1. **Official server requires Premium/Ultimate** — GitLab's built-in MCP server is not available on the free tier. At $29+/user/month, this puts official MCP support behind a significant paywall. Community servers work with any GitLab instance but lack the seamless OAuth integration.

2. **Official server has only 15 tools** — GitLab's built-in server covers the basics (issues, MRs, pipelines, search) but lacks wiki management, release management, milestone tracking, repository operations, and many other features available in community servers with 80-100+ tools.

3. **Still in beta** — The official GitLab MCP server is in beta status (since GitLab 18.6). Tools, behavior, and authentication flow may change. GitLab Duo and beta/experimental features must be enabled for it to work.

4. **Community fragmentation** — Three independent community servers (zereight, yoda-digital, mcpland) each offer 80-100+ tools but with different feature sets, authentication approaches, and quality levels. No clear single community standard has emerged.

5. **No remote hosting** — Unlike GitHub's MCP server (hosted at `api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/` with no local setup needed), GitLab's MCP requires either a Premium/Ultimate subscription or running a community server locally. There's no zero-config cloud option.

6. **Ecosystem size gap vs GitHub** — GitHub's official server has 28.2k stars; GitLab's top community server has 1.2k. GitHub has 7 active MCP-related projects; GitLab has 4-5. The adoption gap means fewer tutorials, examples, and battle-tested configurations for GitLab MCP users.

7. **Self-hosted complexity** — GitLab's strength is self-hosting, but self-hosted instances may have different API versions, features, and authentication configurations. Community MCP servers must handle this variation, and some may not work correctly with older GitLab versions.

8. **OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration complexity** — While elegant in concept, the official server's OAuth flow requires GitLab Duo to be enabled and properly configured. Organizations with restrictive OAuth policies may struggle to allow AI tools to self-register.

9. **Reference server archived** — The Anthropic reference `@modelcontextprotocol/server-gitlab` is archived. Developers who followed MCP documentation to the reference implementation may find it unmaintained.

10. **Write operations carry risk** — Community servers with 100+ tools include powerful write operations (creating MRs, modifying issues, triggering pipelines). An unconstrained AI agent could merge untested code, trigger expensive CI/CD runs, or modify project settings.

## Bottom Line

**Rating: 3.5 out of 5**

GitLab's MCP ecosystem is **stronger than previously reported** — and it's growing. The official MCP server built into GitLab (15 tools, OAuth 2.0, introduced in 18.3) represents genuine first-party commitment, and the community leader [zereight/gitlab-mcp](https://github.com/zereight/gitlab-mcp) (1.2k stars, 100+ tools) is one of the most feature-rich MCP servers for any platform. Enterprise-oriented alternatives from [yoda-digital](https://github.com/yoda-digital/mcp-gitlab-server) (86 tools) and [mcpland](https://github.com/mcpland/gitlab-mcp) (80+ tools with policy engine) provide solid options for organizations needing governance controls.

The **3.5/5 rating** reflects the genuine official support (GitLab is one of the few platforms with a built-in MCP server), strong community alternatives (100+ tools), multiple enterprise-grade options, and self-hosted compatibility. It loses points for the Premium/Ultimate paywall on the official server (15 tools vs community's 100+), beta status, no remote hosting option, the significant ecosystem size gap versus GitHub (1.2k vs 28.2k stars), and community fragmentation across three competing servers.

**Who benefits most from GitLab's MCP ecosystem:**

- **GitLab Premium/Ultimate customers** — the built-in server provides seamless OAuth-based access to issues, merge requests, pipelines, and semantic code search with zero setup
- **Self-hosted GitLab organizations** — community servers work with any GitLab instance, giving self-hosted teams the same AI integration that cloud-hosted platforms offer
- **DevOps teams** — GitLab's full pipeline control (list, create, retry, cancel pipelines, view job logs) through MCP enables AI-powered CI/CD management
- **Enterprise teams needing governance** — mcpland/gitlab-mcp's policy engine (tool allowlists, project-scoped restrictions, read-only mode) enables controlled AI access

**Who should be cautious:**

- **Free-tier GitLab users** — the official server requires Premium/Ultimate; you'll need a community server, which lacks the seamless OAuth integration
- **Teams comparing to GitHub** — if your team could use either platform, GitHub's MCP ecosystem is dramatically more mature (28.2k stars, 21 toolsets, remote hosting, Copilot integration)
- **Small teams** — the effort of evaluating and configuring community servers (3+ options with 80-100+ tools each) may not be justified for simple GitLab workflows
