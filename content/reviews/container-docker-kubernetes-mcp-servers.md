card_description: "Container, Docker, and Kubernetes MCP servers for AI-powered container management, cluster orchestration, Helm chart deployment, and registry interaction. **The most popular Docker MCP server** — ckreiling/mcp-server-docker (687 stars, Python, GPL-3.0) provides comprehensive Docker management including container lifecycle, image operations, network and volume management, and a unique 'plan+apply' compose workflow where the AI proposes container configurations for review before execution. Supports running in a container itself via Docker socket mounting. 53 commits, 3 contributors. **Compose-focused Docker management** — QuantGeekDev/docker-mcp (454 stars, Python, MIT) enables container creation, Docker Compose stack deployment, container logs retrieval, and status monitoring through Claude AI. Focused on basic operations rather than comprehensive orchestration — lacks volume management, network configuration, health checks, and resource constraints. 20 commits, 3 contributors. **The most comprehensive Docker tool suite** — williajm/mcp_docker (3 stars, Python, MIT) provides 33 individually-configurable Docker tools across 5 categories: container management (10 tools — list/inspect/create/start/stop/restart/remove/logs/exec/stats), image management (9 tools — list/inspect/pull/build/push/tag/remove/prune/history), network management (6 tools), volume management (5 tools), and system tools (3 tools — version/events/prune). Features a three-tier safety system (SAFE/MODERATE/DESTRUCTIVE) with tool filtering, 5 AI prompts for troubleshooting/optimization/security audit, 2 resource templates, dual transport (stdio/HTTP), and comprehensive testing including fuzz tests. 155 commits — most mature codebase despite low stars. **Native Kubernetes with the broadest integration** — containers/kubernetes-mcp-server (1,300 stars, Go, Apache-2.0) is a Red Hat-backed native Go implementation that communicates directly with the Kubernetes API — not a kubectl wrapper. Provides 40 tools across configurable toolsets: Core (pods, events, namespaces, generic CRUD), Config (kubeconfig management with auto-detection), Helm (install/list/uninstall charts), KCP (workspace management), Kiali (service mesh visualization), and KubeVirt (virtual machine management). Features multi-cluster support, read-only mode, destructive operation restrictions, OpenTelemetry tracing, single-binary distribution, and Helm chart for deployment. 747 commits, 285 forks — very active development. **The largest Kubernetes tool count** — rohitg00/kubectl-mcp-server (848 stars, Python, MIT) provides 253 tools and 8 workflow prompts. Key capabilities include pod diagnostics with crash analysis, deployment management with rollbacks, cost optimization to identify resource waste, network diagnostics, RBAC auditing, security scanning, Helm chart management, and interactive dashboards. Available via npx (zero-install), pip, or Docker. Works with 15+ MCP-compatible clients. 127 commits. **TypeScript Kubernetes with observability** — Flux159/mcp-server-kubernetes (1,300 stars, TypeScript) wraps kubectl and Helm CLI with MCP tools for resource management (get/list/describe/create/apply/delete), logging, context switching, scaling, patching, rollouts, port forwarding, node management (cordon/drain/uncordon), and pod cleanup. Differentiator: built-in OpenTelemetry integration with distributed tracing supporting Jaeger, Tempo, Grafana, Datadog, and New Relic backends. Non-destructive mode available, secrets masking in output. 772 commits — very active. **Docker's official MCP infrastructure** — docker/mcp-gateway (1,300 stars, Go, MIT) powers the MCP Toolkit in Docker Desktop. Acts as a protocol bridge and lifecycle manager: runs MCP servers in isolated Docker containers, provides unified client interface, handles OAuth authentication and secrets management, organizes servers into shareable profiles, supports OCI catalog integration. 865 commits — Docker's primary investment in MCP. docker/hub-mcp (130 stars, TypeScript, Apache-2.0) provides Docker Hub search with architecture/OS/category filters, namespace management, repository CRUD, tag management, and hardened image recommendations. docker/mcp-registry (453 stars, Go, MIT) is the curated MCP server catalog with cryptographic signatures, provenance tracking, and SBOMs for enterprise trust. **Podman and Docker runtime support** — manusa/podman-mcp-server (61 stars, Go, Apache-2.0) implements MCP for both Podman and Docker container runtimes. Supports container operations (inspect/list/logs/run/stop/remove), image management (build/pull/push/remove), network and volume management. Features dual backends: REST API via Unix socket (preferred) and CLI wrapper (fallback). Multiple transport modes (stdio/HTTP/SSE). Available on npm and PyPI. 154 commits. **Portainer integration for teams** — portainer/portainer-mcp (127 stars, Go, Zlib) connects AI assistants to Portainer environments for enterprise container management. Manages environments, Docker stacks (create/update/compose files), users, teams, access groups, and provides Docker and Kubernetes API proxies. Read-only mode available. Useful for teams already using Portainer as their container management UI. 112 commits, 5 contributors. **Helm chart inspection** — zekker6/mcp-helm (21 stars, Go, MIT) provides 7 tools for working with Helm repositories: list charts, list versions, get latest version, get chart values, get chart contents, get dependencies, and get images. Supports traditional HTTP repositories and OCI registries (Docker Hub, GHCR). Authentication support for basic auth, mTLS, and OCI credentials. Public instance at mcp-helm.zekker.dev. 186 commits. **Gaps remain in several areas** — no Docker Swarm management (Swarm is declining but still used), no container security scanning integration (no Trivy, Grype, or Snyk container scanning), limited multi-cluster federation (individual cluster management only), no cloud Kubernetes cost management (FinOps), no GitOps integration (no ArgoCD or Flux CD triggers), no service mesh management beyond Kiali integration in one server, no container registry vulnerability scanning, no Kubernetes operator management, no namespace-level resource quota management tools. The category earns 4/5 — container and Kubernetes MCP servers form one of the strongest infrastructure categories. Docker management has multiple mature options with ckreiling's server leading on adoption and williajm's on features. Kubernetes is exceptionally well-served with three 1,000+ star implementations taking different approaches (native Go API, Python/kubectl wrapper, TypeScript/kubectl wrapper). Docker's official investment through mcp-gateway, hub-mcp, and mcp-registry shows the company is building MCP as a first-class integration path. The Podman and Portainer entries provide important alternatives for non-Docker and enterprise workflows. Helm chart management rounds out the ecosystem. The main gaps are in security scanning, GitOps workflows, and multi-cluster operations — areas that represent the next frontier for container MCP development."

Container, Docker, and Kubernetes MCP servers let AI assistants manage containers, orchestrate clusters, deploy applications, and interact with container registries through the Model Context Protocol. Instead of memorizing Docker commands or kubectl syntax, AI agents can manage infrastructure conversationally.

This review covers the **container, Docker, and Kubernetes** ecosystem — Docker management tools, Kubernetes orchestrators, Docker's official MCP infrastructure, alternative runtimes, Portainer integration, and Helm chart tools. For related servers, see our [DevOps review](/reviews/devops-mcp-servers/) and [Cloud Platform review](/reviews/cloud-platform-mcp-servers/).

The headline findings: **Three Kubernetes servers have 1,000+ stars** — containers/kubernetes-mcp-server, Flux159/mcp-server-kubernetes, and docker/mcp-gateway. **Docker is investing heavily in MCP** with three official projects (gateway, hub-mcp, registry). **ckreiling/mcp-server-docker (687 stars) leads Docker management** with a unique plan+apply compose workflow. Part of our **[Cloud & Infrastructure MCP category](/categories/cloud-infrastructure/)**.

## Docker Management

### ckreiling/mcp-server-docker (Most Popular)

- **Local stacks** — deploy standalone Docker Compose stacks (v0.7.0+)

Pre-built binaries for Linux (amd64, arm64) and macOS (arm64). Read-only mode available for safety. 112 commits, 5 contributors.

## Helm Chart Tools

### zekker6/mcp-helm (Repository Inspector)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [mcp-helm](https://github.com/zekker6/mcp-helm) | 21 | Go | MIT | 7 |

A **focused Helm repository inspection tool** — 7 tools for chart discovery and analysis:

- **list_repository_charts** — all charts in a repository

## What's Missing

Despite the strength of this category, notable gaps remain:

- **No Docker Swarm management** — Swarm is declining but still used in production
- **No container security scanning** — no Trivy, Grype, or Snyk container scanning integration
- **Limited multi-cluster federation** — each server manages individual clusters only
- **No cloud Kubernetes cost management** — no FinOps or cost allocation tools
- **No GitOps integration** — no ArgoCD or Flux CD workflow triggers
- **No service mesh management** — beyond Kiali integration in kubernetes-mcp-server
- **No container registry vulnerability scanning** — image scanning before deployment
- **No Kubernetes operator management** — installing and managing operators
- **No namespace-level resource quota tools** — quota management and enforcement

## Bottom Line

Container and Kubernetes MCP servers form **one of the strongest infrastructure categories** in the MCP ecosystem. Docker management has multiple mature options — ckreiling's server leads on adoption (687 stars) while williajm's leads on features (33 tools with safety tiers). Kubernetes is exceptionally well-served with three implementations over 800 stars, each taking a different approach: native Go API (containers/kubernetes-mcp-server), Python wrapper with 253 tools (kubectl-mcp-server), and TypeScript with OpenTelemetry (Flux159/mcp-server-kubernetes).

Docker's official investment through mcp-gateway, hub-mcp, and mcp-registry signals that the company sees MCP as a first-class integration path — not a community experiment. The Podman and Portainer entries ensure the ecosystem isn't Docker-only. Helm chart inspection rounds things out.

The main frontier is security scanning, GitOps workflows, and multi-cluster operations. When those gaps fill, this will be a 5/5 category.

**Rating: 4/5** — Strong ecosystem with enterprise backing, multiple mature implementations, and clear Docker corporate investment. Gaps in security scanning and GitOps keep it from a perfect score.
