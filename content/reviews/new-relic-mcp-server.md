**At a glance:** [GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/mcp-server) — 4 stars, 0 forks. Official first-party from [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/). Public preview. 15+ observability tools across 6 categories covering queries, alerts, entities, logs, and advanced analysis.

The New Relic MCP Server is the **official first-party MCP integration** for [New Relic's](https://newrelic.com/) observability platform. It connects AI agents and development tools directly to New Relic's telemetry data, enabling engineers to query metrics, investigate alerts, analyze performance, and generate insights using natural language — all without leaving their IDE or AI assistant.

[New Relic](https://newrelic.com/) was founded in 2008 by Lew Cirne. The company was taken private in November 2023 when [Francisco Partners](https://www.franciscopartners.com/) and [TPG](https://www.tpg.com/) completed a **$6.5 billion acquisition** ($87/share). As of 2026: ~3,050 employees, ~$960M annual revenue (TTM). New Relic provides a unified observability platform covering APM, infrastructure monitoring, log management, digital experience monitoring, serverless, and more.

**Architecture note:** The MCP server acts as an **action engine** rather than a simple data connector. It translates natural language requests into NRQL queries, retrieves telemetry data, and provides AI-powered analysis including root cause identification and deployment impact assessment.

## What It Does

The server provides **15+ tools** organized across six categories:

### Data Access & Queries

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| execute_nrql_query | Execute an NRQL query directly against NRDB |
| natural_language_to_nrql_query | Convert natural language into NRQL, execute it, and return results |

These are the core tools. NRQL (New Relic Query Language) is New Relic's SQL-like query language for accessing all telemetry data. The natural language tool is particularly powerful — engineers don't need to know NRQL syntax to query their observability data.

### Entity & Account Management

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| get_entity | Fetch New Relic entities by GUID |
| list_entity_types | List the complete catalog of entity types with domain/type definitions |
| search_entity_with_tag | Search for entities using specific tag key and value |

Entities are New Relic's abstraction for anything it monitors — applications, hosts, containers, services, browsers, mobile apps, synthetic monitors, and more.

### Alerting & Monitoring

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| list_alert_conditions | List alert condition details for a specific alert policy |
| list_alert_policies | List alert policies for specified accounts, optionally filtering by name |
| search_incident | List all alert events (open and close) with flexible filtering |
| list_recent_issues | List all open issues for specified accounts |
| list_synthetic_monitors | List all synthetic monitors (automated availability/performance tests) |

### Incident Response

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| list_change_events | List change event history for an application entity |
| analyze_deployment_impact | Analyze the performance impact of deployments on specific entities |

### Performance Analytics

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| analyze_golden_metrics | Analyze key health indicators: throughput, response time, error rate, saturation |
| analyze_kafka_metrics | Analyze Kafka consumer lag, producer throughput, message latency, partition balance |
| analyze_threads | Analyze thread metric data including thread state, CPU usage, memory consumption |
| analyze_entity_logs | Analyze application logs for error patterns, anomalous behavior, recurring issues |
| list_entity_error_groups | Fetch error groups from Errors Inbox within a time window |

### Advanced Analysis

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| generate_alert_insights_report | Generate alert intelligence analysis report for a specific issue |
| generate_user_impact_report | Generate end-user impact analysis report for a specific issue |

## Setup & Configuration

### Requirements

- A New Relic account (free tier available — 100 GB data ingest/month)
- A New Relic user API key or OAuth profile
- MCP server access enabled via [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/promotion-management/home)

### Authentication

| Method | Details |
|--------|---------|
| API Key | New Relic user API key configured as environment variable |
| OAuth 2.0 | OAuth profile configured through New Relic platform |

Access is governed by New Relic's **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**. The MCP server can only access data and perform actions that the configured user account has permissions for. Required organizational roles: Organization Read Only, Organization Manager, Organization Product Admin, or a custom role with MCP server read permission.

### Supported AI Clients

- Claude (Desktop and Claude.ai)
- GitHub Copilot
- ChatGPT
- Cursor
- Google Gemini CLI

## Development History

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Jun 2025 | New Relic announces MCP support (press release) |
| Nov 2025 | MCP Server launches into public preview |
| Nov 2025 | Agentic AI Monitoring announced alongside MCP Server |
| 2025-2026 | Community implementations emerge (cloudbring, thrashy, ulucaydin, piekstra, buallen) |

The official `newrelic/mcp-server` repository has only **2 commits** from **1 contributor** (nr-aks) as of March 2026 — the actual server implementation appears to be managed internally, with the GitHub repo serving primarily as documentation and a public entry point.

## Pricing

The MCP server itself is available through New Relic's platform. New Relic's pricing is based on **users + data ingest**:

| Edition | Monthly Cost | Data Ingest | Users |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Free | $0 | 100 GB/month | 1 full platform + unlimited basic |
| Standard | From $10/mo | 100 GB included | Up to 5 full platform ($99/ea additional) |
| Pro | Custom | Custom | Core users $49/mo, full platform custom |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom | Custom pricing |

**User types:**
- **Basic** (free) — View dashboards and alerts
- **Core** ($49/mo) — Developer-level access to logs, telemetry, error tracking
- **Full platform** (varies) — All observability capabilities

Additional data ingest beyond included amounts is billed at volume-based rates.

## Alternatives Comparison

| Feature | New Relic MCP (Official) | cloudbring/newrelic-mcp | Datadog MCP | Grafana MCP |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Maintainer | New Relic | Community | Datadog | Grafana Labs |
| Status | Public Preview | Community | Varies | Varies |
| Stars | 4 | Community project | Varies | Varies |
| Tools | 15+ (queries, alerts, analysis) | Observability integration | Platform-specific | Platform-specific |
| Auth | API key + OAuth 2.0 | API key | API key | API key |
| NRQL support | Native + natural language | NRQL queries | DQL equivalent | PromQL/LogQL |
| Analysis tools | Yes (golden metrics, deployment impact, Kafka, threads) | Basic | Varies | Varies |

**Key differentiator:** New Relic's MCP server goes beyond simple data access — its analysis tools (golden metrics, deployment impact, Kafka metrics, thread analysis, alert intelligence reports) provide AI-powered insights rather than just raw data retrieval. The natural language to NRQL conversion is particularly useful for engineers who aren't NRQL experts.

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Public preview status** — The server is in public preview. Features and behavior may change. Not recommended for mission-critical automated workflows yet.

2. **Minimal GitHub presence** — Only 4 stars, 0 forks, 2 commits from 1 contributor. The actual server appears to be managed internally, making it difficult to assess code quality, report issues, or contribute improvements.

3. **FedRAMP/HIPAA prohibited** — The MCP server **must not be used** if your accounts or data fall under FedRAMP or HIPAA compliance mandates. This is a hard restriction, not just a recommendation.

4. **RBAC complexity** — Access requires proper organizational role assignment. Users must have specific capabilities granted through New Relic's RBAC system, which can be confusing to configure — permission errors are a common troubleshooting issue.

5. **Rate limiting** — Subject to New Relic's standard API rate limits (REST API v2 per-account limits, NerdGraph limits, Synthetic Monitoring API at 3 req/sec). Heavy automated querying could hit these limits.

6. **No local/self-hosted option** — Unlike some MCP servers that run locally via npx or Docker, the New Relic MCP server connects to New Relic's cloud platform. You need an active New Relic account and internet connectivity.

7. **Limited community ecosystem** — Multiple community alternatives exist (cloudbring, thrashy, ulucaydin, piekstra, buallen, ducduyn31), but none have significant adoption. The ecosystem is fragmented compared to more mature MCP integrations.

8. **New Relic account required** — Even the free tier requires account creation. Engineers evaluating the MCP server need to have New Relic instrumentation already deployed in their infrastructure to get meaningful results.

## The Bottom Line

The New Relic MCP Server represents a thoughtful approach to **AI-powered observability** — rather than just exposing raw API endpoints, it provides intelligent analysis tools that help AI assistants understand system health, diagnose issues, and assess deployment impact. The natural language to NRQL conversion is a standout feature that lowers the barrier to querying complex telemetry data.

The tool set is well-designed for **real-world SRE and DevOps workflows**: checking alerts, analyzing golden metrics, investigating deployments, examining logs for patterns, and generating impact reports. The breadth of analysis tools (Kafka metrics, thread analysis, error group tracking) shows New Relic is targeting practical engineering use cases, not just dashboard access.

However, the **public preview status** combined with the **minimal GitHub footprint** (4 stars, 2 commits) raises questions about maturity and community validation. The FedRAMP/HIPAA restriction will be a dealbreaker for regulated industries. And unlike payment MCP servers where the free tier is genuinely free, meaningful use of the New Relic MCP server requires having New Relic instrumentation already deployed — this is a tool for existing New Relic customers, not a way to attract new ones.

**Rating: 3.5 / 5** — Official first-party from a major observability platform with genuinely useful analysis tools that go beyond simple data access. The natural language query support and intelligent analysis features set it apart from community alternatives. Loses points for public preview instability, minimal open source presence, FedRAMP/HIPAA restrictions, and the reality that you need an existing New Relic deployment to get value. If New Relic graduates this from preview with broader compliance support and stronger community engagement, it could reach a 4.
