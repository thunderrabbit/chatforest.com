card_description: "Robotics MCP servers for controlling physical hardware through AI agents — from industrial robot arms to smart home devices to embedded microcontrollers. This is one of the most exciting MCP categories because it bridges the digital-physical gap. **UPDATE (March 2026):** Major growth across the board — xiaozhi-esp32 exploded to 24,900 stars, Home Assistant reached 1,600 stars with 96 tools, ROS integration crossed 1,100 stars, and DimOS (1,700 stars) emerged as the first agentic robotics operating system with full MCP support. Rating upgraded from 4.0 to 4.5/5. **xiaozhi-esp32 is the breakout story** — 78/xiaozhi-esp32 (24,900 stars, C++, MIT) turns ESP32 microcontrollers into MCP-enabled voice AI assistants supporting 70+ open-source hardware platforms, with offline wake-word detection, streaming ASR+LLM+TTS, and speaker recognition. Its companion backend (xinnan-tech/xiaozhi-esp32-server, 8,000 stars) adds voiceprint recognition and knowledge base. **Home Assistant dominates smart home** with homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp (1,600 stars, 96 tools) — device management, automation, calendars, cameras, backups, and system queries. Two community alternatives (tevonsb/homeassistant-mcp at 556 stars with SSE real-time updates, voska/hass-mcp at 284 stars with token-efficient design) ensure coverage. **ROS/ROS2 crossed 1,100 stars** — robotmcp/ros-mcp-server v3.0.1 (now Apache-2.0 licensed) enables bidirectional AI-ROS integration for any ROS1/ROS2 robot. 7+ independent implementations exist. **DimOS is a new category leader** — dimensionalOS/dimos (1,700 stars) is an agentic operating system for physical space with full MCP integration, supporting Unitree quadrupeds (Go2, B1), humanoids (G1), xArm manipulators, and drones via MAVLink/DJI. **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** (138 stars, MIT) enables physics-based robot simulation. **Robot arms** are represented by robot_MCP (71 stars, now Apache-2.0) and universal-robot-mcp. Major gaps: no official servers from any robot manufacturer (Universal Robots, Boston Dynamics, Fanuc, ABB, KUKA, iRobot), no Gazebo-native simulation, no warehouse/logistics robots. The category earns 4.5/5 — exceptional community coverage with explosive growth in embedded AI (xiaozhi-esp32) and the emergence of unified agentic robotics platforms (DimOS)."

*Part of the [IoT & Hardware](/categories/iot-hardware/) category.*

Robotics MCP servers bridge the gap between AI and the physical world — letting agents control robot arms, manage smart homes, program microcontrollers, fly drones, and run physics simulations. Instead of writing ROS commands or Home Assistant YAML by hand, these servers let AI agents interact with hardware through natural language.

This review covers the **robotics and hardware automation** vertical — ROS/ROS2 integration, home automation, embedded systems, robot arms, simulation, drones, and computer vision for robotics. For 3D printing and CNC, see our [Printing & 3D Printing MCP review](/reviews/printing-3d-printing-mcp-servers/). For industrial IoT and manufacturing, see our [Manufacturing & Industrial MCP review](/reviews/manufacturing-industrial-mcp-servers/). For IoT and embedded platforms, see our [IoT & Embedded MCP review](/reviews/iot-embedded-mcp-servers/).

The headline findings: **xiaozhi-esp32 is the breakout star** at 24,900 stars — an MCP-based voice AI platform running on ESP32 microcontrollers, supporting 70+ hardware platforms. **Home Assistant has the most tool-rich robotics MCP server** at 1,600 stars with 96 tools. **ROS/ROS2 integration has matured** — robotmcp/ros-mcp-server crossed 1,100 stars with its v3.0.1 release and Apache-2.0 license. **DimOS emerged as the first agentic robotics OS** at 1,700 stars with full MCP integration for humanoids, quadrupeds, drones, and manipulators. **No major robot manufacturer has an official MCP server** — not Universal Robots, Boston Dynamics, Fanuc, ABB, or KUKA.

## Home Automation

### homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp

## ROS / ROS2 Integration

### robotmcp/ros-mcp-server

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [robotmcp/ros-mcp-server](https://github.com/robotmcp/ros-mcp-server) | 1,100 | Python | Apache-2.0 | — |

The **most popular ROS MCP server** and the gateway to controlling any ROS-based robot with AI. Now at v3.0.1 (January 2026) with Apache-2.0 licensing. Key features:

- **Bidirectional AI-ROS integration** — not just sending commands, but receiving sensor data and robot state
- **ROS1 and ROS2 support** — works with both generations of the Robot Operating System
- **Zero code changes** — only requires a rosbridge node on the robot side
- **Topic subscription** — real-time sensor data streams (lidar, cameras, IMU, joint states)
- **Service calls** — trigger robot behaviors (navigation goals, gripper commands, mode changes)
- **Multi-platform AI support** — works with Claude Desktop, Gemini, and ChatGPT

The jump from 873 to 1,100 stars and the switch to Apache-2.0 licensing signal maturation — this is no longer an experiment but a serious integration layer for the robotics community.

### lpigeon/ros-mcp-server

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [lpigeon/ros-mcp-server](https://github.com/lpigeon/ros-mcp-server) | 148 | Python | MIT | ~8 |

A more focused alternative with explicit tool definitions: list topics, list services, list message types, view type definitions, publish/subscribe topics, call services (including custom), get/set parameters. Uses WebSocket via rosbridge and works cross-platform (Linux/Windows/macOS).

### Additional ROS Implementations

- **kakimochi/ros2-mcp-server** (~73 stars, Python, MIT) — ROS2-specific, topic-based robot control

- **ngres/ros2mcp** — expose arbitrary ROS2 services and topics as MCP tools; includes Gazebo and Rviz2 demo

At least 7 independent ROS MCP servers exist — reflecting the robotics community's enthusiasm for AI integration. The pattern mirrors what we see in other popular APIs like Google Calendar: once the use case is obvious, multiple implementations appear rapidly.

## Embedded Hardware

### 78/xiaozhi-esp32

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [78/xiaozhi-esp32](https://github.com/78/xiaozhi-esp32) | 24,900 | C++ | MIT | — |

## Agentic Robotics Platforms

### dimensionalOS/dimos

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [dimensionalOS/dimos](https://github.com/dimensionalOS/dimos) | 1,700 | Python | — | — |

**NEW.** The first **agentic operating system for physical space** — and a significant new entry in the robotics MCP landscape. DimOS doesn't just control one robot; it provides a unified framework for humanoids, quadrupeds, drones, and manipulators with full MCP integration.

- **Hardware support** — Unitree quadrupeds (Go2, B1), humanoids (G1), xArm manipulators, MAVLink drones, DJI drones
- **Navigation & mapping** — SLAM, dynamic obstacle avoidance, route planning, autonomous exploration
- **Perception** — object detectors, 3D projections, vision language models, audio processing
- **Spatial memory** — spatio-temporal RAG, dynamic memory, object localization
- **MCP skills** — expose robot capabilities as MCP tools via `dimos mcp` command interface
- **Multi-agent systems** — coordinate multiple robots working in the same physical space
- **Multi-language interop** — C++, Lua, TypeScript via LCM

DimOS represents a shift from "one MCP server per robot" to "one operating system with MCP as the AI integration layer." At 1,700 stars and growing, this could become the ROS-successor for AI-native robotics.

## What's Missing

The gaps in robotics MCP are significant:

- **No official manufacturer servers** — Universal Robots, Boston Dynamics, Fanuc, ABB, KUKA, iRobot, and every other major robot company are absent
- **No Gazebo-native MCP** — simulation is only accessible via ROS bridge, not directly
- **No warehouse/logistics robot servers** — no AMR (Autonomous Mobile Robot) fleet management
- **No agricultural robot servers** — despite precision agriculture being a major robotics market
- **No consumer robot integration** — no Roomba, no Roborock, no lawn mower robots
- **No Peloton or Zwift** — fitness equipment with robotics-like control surfaces
- **No safety-certified servers** — robotics has strict safety standards (ISO 10218, IEC 62443) that no MCP server addresses
- **No digital twin platforms** — Azure Digital Twins, AWS IoT TwinMaker, Siemens MindSphere are all absent

The safety gap is particularly notable. Industrial robots can cause serious harm, and none of these servers implement the safety interlocks, watchdog timers, or emergency stop protocols that real industrial deployments require. The Universal Robots MCP has collision detection, but that's the exception.

## Bottom Line

Robotics MCP servers earn **4.5 out of 5** (upgraded from 4.0). The category has grown to 50+ servers across home automation, ROS, embedded hardware, robot arms, simulation, drones, computer vision, and now agentic robotics platforms.

**The big story since our last review is explosive growth.** xiaozhi-esp32 rocketed to 24,900 stars — making it the highest-starred MCP-integrated project in any robotics subcategory and proving that MCP has penetrated the consumer electronics space. Home Assistant grew from 1,200 to 1,600 stars while expanding to 96 tools. ROS crossed 1,100 stars with a v3.0.1 release and Apache-2.0 licensing. DimOS emerged at 1,700 stars as the first agentic operating system for physical robots with native MCP integration.

The community is still building faster than the manufacturers. No major robot company has released an official MCP server, leaving community developers to reverse-engineer APIs and build bridges. But the quality and ambition of community projects — especially DimOS with its multi-robot, multi-hardware-platform approach — suggests that vendor adoption may be less critical than we thought.

For smart home enthusiasts, **ha-mcp** is essential. For roboticists, **robotmcp/ros-mcp-server** is the universal adapter. For embedded AI, **xiaozhi-esp32** is the reference implementation. For multi-robot systems, **DimOS** is the emerging platform. For makers, **platformio-mcp** and **choturobo** open up AI-controlled hardware. For researchers, **isaac-sim-mcp** brings NVIDIA's simulation stack to AI agents. The category has real depth — and the growth rate suggests it will keep accelerating.
