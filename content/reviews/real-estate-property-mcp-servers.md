card_description: "Real estate and property MCP servers for property search, valuation, market analysis, mortgage calculations, and CRM integration. The category has surprising breadth — from Airbnb vacation rentals to MLS listing data to mortgage document parsing — but the ecosystem is fragmented across dozens of small, narrowly-scoped servers. The standout by star count is openbnb-org/mcp-server-airbnb (394 stars, MIT) with just 2 tools but polished DXT packaging and 0.1.3 release maturity. For traditional real estate, sap156/zillow-mcp-server (31 stars) offers 7 tools connecting to Zillow's Bridge API for property search, Zestimates, market trends, and mortgage calculations. zellerhaus/batchdata-mcp-real-estate (27 stars, TypeScript, MIT) provides 8 tools for property data via BatchData.io's APIs including address verification, geocoding, and boundary searches. agentic-ops/real-estate-mcp (26 stars) is the most comprehensive general-purpose server with 30+ tools across property management, agent operations, market analysis, client management, and area intelligence. Repliers-io/mcp-server (14 stars) offers the closest thing to real MLS data access with 8 tools for listings, similar properties, address history, and neighborhood data. The MLS space is evolving rapidly — GumpperGroup's UNLOCK MLS RESO Reference server represents the first standards-based approach using Bridge Interactive's RESO Web API, signaling that the real estate industry is taking MCP seriously. For mortgage and investment analysis, confersolutions/mcp-mortgage-server parses Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure PDFs into MISMO-compliant JSON with TRID compliance checking, while sigaihealth/realvestmcp provides 31 professional calculators covering everything from BRRRR analysis to syndication evaluation. The regional diversity is notable — servers exist for Korean (MOLIT API), Australian, Swedish (Booli.se), French, Spanish (Fotocasa), California, Philippine (DHSUD License to Sell), and Russian (Rosreestr cadastral) markets. Major gaps remain: no official servers from Zillow, Realtor.com, Redfin, or Trulia; no Zillow Rental Manager integration; limited commercial real estate coverage (no CoStar, LoopNet, or CREXi); no title search or closing automation; and no integration with major real estate CRMs like Follow Up Boss, kvCORE, or Sierra Interactive. The category earns 3.5/5 — impressive breadth across property search, valuation, mortgage analysis, and international markets, but the absence of official platform servers and the fragmentation across many low-star repositories limits production readiness."

Real estate MCP servers are connecting AI assistants to property data, market analytics, and transaction workflows. Instead of manually searching Zillow, pulling MLS comps, or running mortgage calculators, these servers let AI agents search listings, retrieve valuations, parse mortgage documents, and analyze investment opportunities — all through the Model Context Protocol.

The landscape spans six areas: **property search & listings** (Airbnb, Zillow, MLS access), **property data & valuation** (BatchData, appraisal tools), **real estate CRM & management** (agent tools, deal pipelines), **MLS & industry standards** (RESO-based servers), **mortgage & investment analysis** (document parsing, financial calculators), and **regional market servers** (country-specific property data).

The headline findings: **Airbnb dominates by star count** — openbnb-org/mcp-server-airbnb (394 stars) is the most popular real estate MCP server by a wide margin, though it only covers vacation rentals. **No major real estate platform has an official MCP server** — Zillow, Realtor.com, Redfin, and Trulia are all absent, leaving community implementations to fill the gap. **The MLS industry is paying attention** — David Gumpper's UNLOCK MLS RESO Reference server represents the first standards-based MLS data access via MCP, built on Bridge Interactive's RESO Web API. **Mortgage document parsing exists** — confersolutions/mcp-mortgage-server converts Loan Estimates and Closing Disclosures into MISMO-compliant JSON. **Regional diversity is remarkable** — servers exist for Korean, Australian, Swedish, French, Spanish, Philippine, and Russian property markets. **The biggest gap is commercial real estate** — no CoStar, LoopNet, CREXi, or commercial listing servers exist.

## Property Search & Listings

### mcp-server-airbnb (openbnb-org)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [openbnb-org/mcp-server-airbnb](https://github.com/openbnb-org/mcp-server-airbnb) | 394 | JavaScript | MIT | 2 |

The **most popular real estate MCP server** by far, with nearly 400 stars. Provides two focused tools:

- **airbnb_search** — location-based property search with filtering by dates, guest count, price range, and amenities, plus Google Maps Place ID integration for precise location targeting
- **airbnb_listing_details** — comprehensive property information including amenities, policies, and neighborhood details

Packaged as a Desktop Extension (DXT) for easy installation with Claude Desktop and other compatible clients. Version 0.1.3 (July 2025) suggests active maintenance. The narrow 2-tool design is intentional — search and detail retrieval cover the primary vacation rental use case cleanly.

### zillow-mcp-server (sap156)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [sap156/zillow-mcp-server](https://github.com/sap156/zillow-mcp-server) | 31 | Python | MIT | 7 |

The leading community-built Zillow integration, connecting to **Zillow's Bridge API** for real-time property data. Seven tools cover the core residential real estate workflow:

- **search_properties** — find listings with various search criteria
- **get_property_details** — comprehensive property information
- **get_zestimate** — Zillow's proprietary automated valuation model
- **get_market_trends** — area-level market analytics
- **calculate_mortgage** — payment estimation with principal, interest, taxes, and insurance
- **check_health** — API connectivity verification
- **get_server_tools** — tool discovery

Built with FastMCP and includes exponential retry logic via the backoff library. Requires a Bridge API key (from api@bridgeinteractive.com), which is a barrier for casual users. Multiple other Zillow MCP servers exist on Glama and PulseMCP (BACH-AI-Tools/zillow56, rohitsingh-iitd/zillow-mcp-server), but sap156's has the most stars and the most complete tool set.

### Repliers MCP Server (Repliers-io)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [Repliers-io/mcp-server](https://github.com/Repliers-io/mcp-server) | 14 | JavaScript | MIT | 8 |

The closest thing to **real MLS listing data** via MCP, providing access to the Repliers API for Canadian real estate data:

- **search** — advanced property search with filters
- **get-a-listing** — individual listing details
- **find-similar-listings** — comparable property discovery
- **get-address-history** — transaction history for an address
- **property-types-styles** — available property classifications
- **get-deleted-listings** — track removed listings
- **areas-cities-and-neighborhoods** — geographic boundary data
- **buildings** — building-level information for condos/apartments

The similar listings and address history tools are particularly valuable for real estate agents doing comparative market analysis (CMA). Requires a Repliers API key.

### HomeHarvest MCP (ZacharyHampton)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [ZacharyHampton/HomeHarvest](https://github.com/ZacharyHampton/HomeHarvest) | — | Python | — | — |

HomeHarvest is primarily a **real estate scraping library** (extracting data from Realtor.com, Zillow, and Redfin) that has added an MCP server interface. The library formats scraped data in MLS-style listing format. The MCP integration enables AI agents to pull property data directly, though the scraping approach raises questions about terms-of-service compliance compared to official API-based servers.

### Other Airbnb Servers

Multiple alternative Airbnb MCP servers exist: **vedantparmar12/airbnb-mcp** adds LiveKit voice interaction for natural language property search, **Domoteek/mcp-server-airbnb** provides a French-language alternative, and **josuebatista/mcp-agent** combines MCP with Claude for listing data processing. The openbnb-org server's 394 stars dwarfs all alternatives.

## Property Data & Valuation

### batchdata-mcp-real-estate (zellerhaus)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [zellerhaus/batchdata-mcp-real-estate](https://github.com/zellerhaus/batchdata-mcp-real-estate) | 27 | TypeScript | MIT | 8 |

Integrates with **BatchData.io's property and address APIs** across two tool categories:

Address operations (4 tools):
- **verify** — USPS address verification
- **autocomplete** — address suggestions
- **geocode** — address to lat/lng conversion
- **reverse-geocode** — lat/lng to address lookup

Property operations (4 tools):
- **lookup** — property details by address or APN (Assessor Parcel Number)
- **search** — advanced filtered property searches
- **boundary search** — geographic boundary queries
- **count** — match counting for search criteria

Supports installation via Smithery, npm, or Docker with multi-stage builds and health checks. Rate limits vary by endpoint (5,000 max for address verification, 90 for geocoding, 1,000 for property search). The APN-based lookup is notable — it's the identifier system that county assessors and title companies actually use.

### Property Valuation Server (creis-ai)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [creis-ai/mcp-property-valuation-server](https://github.com/creis-ai/mcp-property-valuation-server) | 3 | JavaScript | MIT | 3 |

A specialized server for **Chinese real estate market** valuation:

- **get_community_rating** — multidimensional community assessment based on activity levels, property management quality, educational resources, and location factors
- **get_community_valuation** — area-level price analysis
- **get_property_valuation** — individual property value estimation

Designed for real estate transactions, investment due diligence, and mortgage collateral evaluation in the Chinese market. The 46 commits suggest ongoing development despite low star count.

### Property MCP Server (noahw345)

Connects Claude to the **ATTOM Data API** for US property analysis. ATTOM aggregates data from county assessors, recorders, and other public records across 155M+ US properties. Less well-documented than BatchData but accesses a different (and in some cases more comprehensive) underlying dataset.

## Real Estate CRM & Management

### real-estate-mcp (agentic-ops)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [agentic-ops/real-estate-mcp](https://github.com/agentic-ops/real-estate-mcp) | 26 | Python | — | 30+ |

The **most comprehensive general-purpose real estate MCP server**, with 30+ tools across six categories:

- **Property Management** (7 tools) — listing CRUD, search, filtering
- **Agent Operations** (6 tools) — agent performance tracking, assignment management
- **Market Analysis** (7 tools) — pricing trends, comparative market analysis, demand indicators
- **Client Management** (3 tools) — buyer/seller relationship tracking
- **Area Intelligence** (9 tools) — neighborhood data, school ratings, demographics, commute analysis
- **System Management** (2 tools) — health checks, configuration

Also provides 10 resources (5 static + 5 dynamic templates), 11 prompts across 4 categories, and SSE transport support. This is a demo/showcase project that has been incorporated into several related real estate projects for renting, buying, and consulting workflows.

### propstack-mcp (ashev87)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [ashev87/propstack-mcp](https://github.com/ashev87/propstack-mcp) | 1 | TypeScript | MIT | 50 |

Integrates with **Propstack**, a real estate CRM platform used primarily in Europe, providing the **highest tool count** of any real estate MCP server:

- Contact management with GDPR tracking
- Property filtering by multiple criteria
- Deal pipeline management
- Viewing/showing scheduling
- Natural language buyer matching ("3-room apartment in Berlin under 400k with balcony")
- Email templating and task logging
- Pipeline dashboards and lead intake workflows

50 tools across 12 categories. Created February 2026, suggesting active development. Despite the low star count, the tool depth and CRM integration patterns are notable — this is what a production real estate agent workflow looks like.

### Other CRM Servers

**Inmovilla MCP Server** (laica-ayudavets) manages properties, clients, and owners via the Inmovilla CRM platform (Spanish market). Real estate CRM is an area ripe for growth — major platforms like Follow Up Boss, kvCORE, Sierra Interactive, and Wise Agent have no MCP servers yet.

## MLS & Industry Standards

### UNLOCK MLS RESO Reference MCP Server (GumpperGroup)

The most significant development in real estate MCP is the emergence of **standards-based MLS access**. David Gumpper (WAV Group partner, former CTO of Michael Saunders & Company) built this reference implementation using **UNLOCK MLS** data through **Bridge Interactive's RESO Web API**.

This matters because:
- **RESO (Real Estate Standards Organization)** standardized MLS listing data across MLSs — MCP is now standardizing how AI interacts with that data
- The server provides governed access with **full audit trails and compliance monitoring** — critical for an industry with strict data licensing rules
- It's positioned as a next-generation alternative to IDX feeds, but built for AI rather than websites
- WAV Group has published extensively about MLS MCP servers, signaling industry buy-in at the consulting/strategy level

The real estate industry's relationship with data access has always been complex (IDX, RETS, now RESO Web API). MCP servers that respect MLS data licensing while enabling AI workflows will be essential for mainstream adoption.

## Mortgage & Investment Analysis

### mcp-mortgage-server (confersolutions)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [confersolutions/mcp-mortgage-server](https://github.com/confersolutions/mcp-mortgage-server) | 2 | Python | MIT | 4 |

A specialized server for **AI-driven mortgage document analysis**:

- **parse_loan_estimate** — extract structured data from Loan Estimate PDFs
- **parse_closing_disclosure** — parse Closing Disclosure documents
- **compare_le_cd** — detect discrepancies between LE and CD for TRID compliance
- **hello** — connectivity test

Converts residential loan paperwork into **MISMO-compliant JSON** (MISMO is the mortgage industry data standard). The TRID compliance violation detection is particularly valuable — the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule governs what lenders must disclose and when, and violations can result in significant penalties.

Built with Pydantic validation, HTTPS enforcement, domain whitelisting, and SSRF prevention. The v2.0.0 release (November 2025) was a major rewrite from REST API to MCP. Despite only 2 stars, this fills a genuine industry need.

### RealVest MCP Server (sigaihealth)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [sigaihealth/realvestmcp](https://github.com/sigaihealth/realvestmcp) | — | JavaScript | MIT | 31 |

**31 professional real estate investment calculators** via MCP, covering:

- **calculate_affordability** — how much house can you afford
- **analyze_brrrr_deal** — Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat analysis
- **evaluate_house_hack** — owner-occupied investment evaluation
- **project_portfolio_growth** — multi-property portfolio modeling
- **analyze_syndication** — real estate syndication evaluation
- **calculate_mortgage_affordability** — DTI-based qualification
- **analyze_debt_to_income** — lender qualification ratios
- **compare_loans** — side-by-side loan comparison

The 241 tests and comprehensive calculator coverage suggest production-grade quality. Particularly useful for real estate investors who need to evaluate deals quickly — the BRRRR, house hacking, and syndication calculators reflect modern investment strategies that most basic mortgage calculators don't cover.

### Real Estate Investment MCP (ericnsibley)

Connects to a **Zillow SQLite database** containing ZHVI (Zillow Home Value Index), ZHVF (forecast), ZORI (Observed Rent Index), and ZORF (rent forecast) data. Useful for market-level investment analysis — identifying appreciation trends and rental yield by ZIP code or metro area.

## Regional & Specialized Servers

The real estate MCP ecosystem has notable **international breadth**:

| Server | Market | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [tae0y/real-estate-mcp](https://github.com/tae0y/real-estate-mcp) | South Korea | Korean apartment prices via MOLIT (Ministry of Land) open API |
| [gum798/A2A-MCP-RealEstate](https://github.com/gum798/A2A-MCP-RealEstate) | South Korea | AI-powered property recommendation with investment and quality-of-life scoring |
| BACH-AI-Tools/realty-in-au | Australia | Property listings and school lookups |
| matt1as/booli-mcp | Sweden | Swedish real estate via Booli.se with GraphQL |
| neil-ac/melo-mcp | France | French property search with price and location filtering |
| BACH-AI-Tools/fotocasa1 | Spain | Spanish listings via Fotocasa API |
| BACH-AI-Tools/realty-in-ca1 | California | California listings with demographic data |
| yasg1988/mcp-rosreestr | Russia | Rosreestr cadastral data with coordinates and valuations |
| GodModeArch/lts-mcp | Philippines | DHSUD License to Sell verification |

The Korean market is best served with two competing implementations — one for raw price data (MOLIT API), one for AI-powered recommendations. The BACH-AI-Tools pattern (multiple regional servers with the same architecture) provides the broadest geographic coverage from a single developer.

## What's Missing

The real estate MCP ecosystem has significant gaps:

- **No official platform servers** — Zillow, Realtor.com, Redfin, Trulia, and Homes.com have no official MCP servers, despite Zillow releasing APIs and (reportedly) exploring MCP
- **No commercial real estate** — CoStar, LoopNet, CREXi, and Crexi have no MCP presence; commercial RE data is notoriously locked behind expensive subscriptions
- **Limited CRM integration** — Follow Up Boss, kvCORE, Sierra Interactive, Wise Agent, LionDesk, and other major real estate CRMs are absent
- **No title & escrow** — no title search, lien check, or closing automation servers
- **No rental management** — Zillow Rental Manager, Apartments.com, RentSpree, and AppFolio have no MCP servers
- **No construction/development** — no new construction listing, permitting, or project management servers
- **No appraisal tools** — no integration with appraisal management companies (AMCs) or USPAP-compliant valuation workflows

## The Bottom Line

Real estate MCP servers earn **3.5 out of 5**. The ecosystem shows impressive breadth — from vacation rental search (Airbnb, 394 stars) to mortgage document parsing (MISMO-compliant) to 31 investment calculators to MLS standards-body involvement (RESO). International coverage is remarkable, with servers spanning 8+ countries.

But the category is held back by fragmentation and the absence of official platform servers. The highest-starred server (Airbnb, 394 stars) only covers vacation rentals. For traditional real estate, the best options hover around 30 stars each. Most servers require paid API keys (Zillow Bridge, BatchData, Repliers) that add friction. Commercial real estate — arguably the higher-value use case — is completely unserved.

The most promising signal is industry engagement: the MLS/RESO community is actively exploring MCP as the next evolution of real estate data access, positioning it as "IDX feeds for AI." If major platforms follow through with official servers and MLS data becomes broadly accessible via MCP, this category could jump to 4.5/5 within a year.

**Best for property search:** [openbnb-org/mcp-server-airbnb](https://github.com/openbnb-org/mcp-server-airbnb) (vacation rentals) or [sap156/zillow-mcp-server](https://github.com/sap156/zillow-mcp-server) (residential)

**Best for property data:** [zellerhaus/batchdata-mcp-real-estate](https://github.com/zellerhaus/batchdata-mcp-real-estate) (8 tools, address verification + property lookup)

**Best for investment analysis:** [sigaihealth/realvestmcp](https://github.com/sigaihealth/realvestmcp) (31 calculators including BRRRR, syndication, portfolio modeling)

**Best for mortgage:** [confersolutions/mcp-mortgage-server](https://github.com/confersolutions/mcp-mortgage-server) (MISMO-compliant document parsing)

**Best for MLS access:** [Repliers-io/mcp-server](https://github.com/Repliers-io/mcp-server) (8 tools, similar listings, address history)
