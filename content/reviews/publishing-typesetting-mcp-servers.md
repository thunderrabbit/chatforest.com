content_type: "Review"
card_description: "Publishing and typesetting MCP servers across LaTeX/Overleaf, document format conversion, eBooks and reading, book discovery, print-on-demand, desktop publishing, and PDF tools. The document conversion subcategory is the most mature — zcaceres/markdownify-mcp (2,400 stars, TypeScript, MIT) is the standout server in the entire category, converting virtually anything (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, images, audio, YouTube transcripts) into Markdown with 10 specialized tools, making it the de facto gateway for ingesting documents into AI workflows. vivekVells/mcp-pandoc (512 stars, Python) wraps the venerable Pandoc engine for bidirectional format conversion across Markdown, HTML, PDF, DOCX, LaTeX, EPUB, RST, and ODT — the only server offering true multi-format output including EPUB generation. For LaTeX, the ecosystem is fragmented but functional — 5+ Overleaf integration servers exist (mjyoo2/OverleafMCP at 73 stars is the most established read-only implementation, hiufungleung/overleafMCP-rw adds write capabilities with full Git workflow), while standalone LaTeX servers like aaronsb/texflow-mcp (20 stars) provide structured document models where AI operates on sections and paragraphs while the system handles all LaTeX mechanics. axiomlogicnexus/TeXstudio-LaTeX-MCP-Server offers the deepest IDE integration with 30+ tools including linting, formatting, bibliography management, and package installation. For academic publishing specifically, takashiishida/arxiv-latex-mcp (111 stars, MIT) fetches arXiv paper LaTeX source directly — far more useful than PDF extraction for math-heavy papers. The eBook space is surprisingly rich — onebirdrocks/ebook-mcp (351 stars, Apache-2.0) provides AI-powered reading experiences with quizzes and explanations for EPUB and PDF, trieloff/calibre-mcp (28 stars) bridges Calibre's vast library management capabilities, and vgnshiyer/apple-books-mcp (40 stars) extracts highlights and annotations from Apple Books for AI-powered reading analysis. andylbrummer/booklife-mcp (Go, 27 tools) unifies Hardcover, Libby/OverDrive, and Open Library into a single reading management platform. Book discovery gets two solid implementations: 8enSmith/mcp-open-library (62 stars, MIT) and mcp-google-books. Print-on-demand is an emerging niche — TSavo/printify-mcp (24 stars) integrates with Printify's platform including AI image generation via Replicate's Flux model for creating designs, while devlimelabs/lulu-print-mcp provides 20+ tools for the Lulu Print API covering print jobs, file validation, cost calculation, and shipping management. Desktop publishing has ambitious implementations — zachshallbetter/indesign-mcp-server claims 135+ tools for Adobe InDesign automation, lucdesign/indesign-mcp-server provides 35+ tools with professional typography and EPUB export, and matrayu/adobe-mcp offers a unified server for the entire Adobe Creative Suite. Canva gets MCP integration through EmilyThaHuman/canva-mcp-server with 20 tools including AI design generation. PDF manipulation rounds out the category with hanweg/mcp-pdf-tools (75 stars) for merging, extracting, and searching PDFs, plus 2b3pro/markdown2pdf-mcp for generating PDFs with syntax highlighting and Mermaid diagrams. The category earns 3.5/5 — markdownify-mcp and mcp-pandoc are genuinely best-in-class document conversion tools that anchor the ecosystem, eBook servers are unexpectedly comprehensive, and academic LaTeX workflows are well-served. Deductions for extreme fragmentation in the LaTeX/Overleaf space (5+ competing servers with significant overlap), desktop publishing servers that require specific macOS/InDesign setups limiting practical use, no EPUB authoring tools (only reading), no dedicated Kindle publishing or Amazon KDP integration, no newspaper/magazine layout tools, and limited print production features beyond the two print-on-demand servers."

Publishing and typesetting MCP servers give AI agents the ability to compile LaTeX documents, convert between dozens of document formats, manage eBook libraries, create print-on-demand products, and automate desktop publishing workflows through natural language. Instead of wrestling with LaTeX syntax, configuring Pandoc command-line flags, or navigating InDesign's menus, an AI agent can handle it conversationally: "Take my Markdown draft, convert it to a professionally formatted PDF with proper typography, then prepare an EPUB version for distribution."

This review covers the **publishing and typesetting** vertical — LaTeX compilation, document format conversion, eBook management, book discovery, print-on-demand, desktop publishing, and PDF tools. For content management systems (WordPress, Ghost, Substack), see our [CMS & Content Management MCP review](/reviews/cms-content-management-mcp-servers/). For audio/video processing, see our [Audio & Video Processing MCP review](/reviews/audio-video-processing-mcp-servers/). For PDF reading/extraction specifically, see our [PDF & Document MCP review](/reviews/pdf-document-mcp-servers/).

The landscape spans seven areas: **LaTeX & Overleaf** (academic typesetting, Overleaf project integration, arXiv paper access), **document format conversion** (Pandoc, Markdown-to-PDF, universal-to-Markdown), **eBooks & reading** (EPUB/PDF reading, Calibre library management, Apple Books highlights), **book discovery & metadata** (Open Library, Google Books), **print-on-demand** (Printify, Lulu Print), **desktop publishing** (Adobe InDesign, Canva), and **PDF tools** (merge, extract, manipulate).

The headline findings: **Document conversion is the strongest subcategory** — markdownify-mcp (2,400 stars) is the single most popular server in this review. **LaTeX/Overleaf integration is fragmented** — 5+ competing Overleaf servers with overlapping functionality. **eBook management is surprisingly mature** — ebook-mcp (351 stars) enables AI-powered reading with quizzes. **Print-on-demand is an emerging niche** with both Printify and Lulu Print getting MCP servers. **Desktop publishing is ambitious but platform-limited** — InDesign servers require macOS + Adobe InDesign, restricting practical use.

## LaTeX & Overleaf

### OverleafMCP (Read-Only)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [mjyoo2/OverleafMCP](https://github.com/mjyoo2/OverleafMCP) | 73 | JavaScript | MIT | 6 |

The **most established Overleaf integration**, providing read-only access to Overleaf projects through Git:

- **list_projects** — enumerate all Overleaf projects linked to the user's account
- **list_files** — browse files within a specific project
- **read_file** — retrieve the contents of any LaTeX file
- **get_sections** — parse LaTeX document structure into section headings
- **get_section_content** — extract content from specific sections by title
- **status_summary** — overview of project state

Requires an Overleaf account with Git access (premium feature). Connects through Git rather than Overleaf's API, which means it works with self-hosted Overleaf instances too. Multiple projects can be managed simultaneously.

### OverleafMCP-rw (Read/Write)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [hiufungleung/overleafMCP-rw](https://github.com/hiufungleung/overleafMCP-rw) | 2 | JavaScript | MIT | 11 |

Extends the read-only OverleafMCP with **full write capabilities** via Git workflow:

All 6 read tools from OverleafMCP, plus:
- **write_file** — create or modify LaTeX files in the project
- **delete_file** — remove files from the project
- **commit_changes** — commit modifications with custom messages
- **push_changes** — push commits back to Overleaf
- **git_status** — check repository status before committing

This is the only Overleaf MCP server that enables AI agents to actually edit documents and push changes back, making it suitable for AI-assisted academic writing workflows.

### Other Overleaf Implementations

| Server | Stars | Language | Notes |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| [GhoshSrinjoy/Overleaf-mcp](https://github.com/GhoshSrinjoy/Overleaf-mcp) | — | — | Read/analyze LaTeX files |
| [unnipv/overleaf-mcp](https://github.com/unnipv/overleaf-mcp) | — | — | AI-assisted LaTeX editing |
| [M-H-Amini/Overleaf-MCP-Server](https://github.com/M-H-Amini/Overleaf-MCP-Server) | — | — | Another Overleaf integration |

The Overleaf MCP space has significant fragmentation — at least 5 implementations exist with varying levels of maturity, all doing roughly the same thing through Git access.

### TeXFlow

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [aaronsb/texflow-mcp](https://github.com/aaronsb/texflow-mcp) | 20 | Python | MIT | 6 |

A **structured document authoring system** that takes a fundamentally different approach from other LaTeX servers — AI agents work with a semantic document model (sections, paragraphs, figures, tables) while TeXFlow handles all LaTeX mechanics:

- **document** — scaffold new documents or ingest existing Markdown
- **layout** — configure page layout, fonts, and formatting
- **edit** — modify document elements at the structural level
- **render** — compile to PDF, PNG page previews, or .tex export
- **reference** — searchable LaTeX commands, symbols, packages, and error documentation
- **queue** — batch multiple operations in a single call

Key design decision: the document auto-saves as JSON, and LaTeX is only ever an output artifact. This means AI agents never need to understand LaTeX syntax — they work in a structured model and get professionally typeset output. Supports PDF compilation, PNG page previews, and raw .tex export.

### TeXstudio LaTeX MCP Server

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [axiomlogicnexus/TeXstudio-LaTeX-MCP-Server](https://github.com/axiomlogicnexus/TeXstudio-LaTeX-MCP-Server) | 1 | TypeScript | MIT | 30+ |

The **deepest LaTeX IDE integration**, connecting to TeXstudio with a full toolchain:

- **Editor integration** — launch TeXstudio at specific file positions with session management
- **Compilation** — latexmk-based PDF generation with engine fallbacks and Perl diagnostics
- **Code quality** — linting via chktex and formatting using latexindent
- **Project intelligence** — root document detection, dependency graphing, out-of-date analysis
- **Bibliography management** — automated biber/bibtex processing
- **PDF tools** — optimization and metadata inspection
- **Package management** — discover and install LaTeX packages
- **Container support** — optional Docker-based compilation workflows

Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) with path containment security and shell-escape policies. Despite low star count, the tool coverage is remarkably comprehensive — more LaTeX toolchain features than any other server in this review.

|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [takashiishida/arxiv-latex-mcp](https://github.com/takashiishida/arxiv-latex-mcp) | 111 | Python | MIT | 4 |

A **critical academic publishing tool** that fetches arXiv paper LaTeX source code directly — far more useful than PDF extraction for math-heavy papers where equation rendering matters:

- **get_paper_prompt** — retrieve full flattened LaTeX source for a paper
- **get_paper_abstract** — extract just the abstract
- **list_paper_sections** — enumerate section headings
- **get_paper_section** — extract a specific section's content

Particularly valuable for computer science, mathematics, and engineering where precise interpretation of mathematical expressions is crucial. Available as a Claude Desktop Extension (.dxt) for easy installation. Uses arxiv-to-prompt under the hood for LaTeX processing.

## Document Format Conversion

### markdownify-mcp

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |

| [lucdesign/indesign-mcp-server](https://github.com/lucdesign/indesign-mcp-server) | 11 | JavaScript | MIT | 35+ |
| [chris-enea/indesign-mcp](https://github.com/chris-enea/indesign-mcp) | 9 | Python | — | 4 |

Three implementations target **Adobe InDesign**, the industry-standard desktop publishing application:

**zachshallbetter/indesign-mcp-server** (8 stars, 135+ tools) is the most ambitious — covering document lifecycle management, page manipulation, text frames with professional typography, graphics with precise scaling, tables, layers, master spreads, styles, colors, and multi-document book creation. Designed for automated report generation, brand asset management, and multi-page publication workflows.

**lucdesign/indesign-mcp-server** (11 stars, MIT, 35+ tools) focuses on practical publishing workflows — document management with standard page formats (A4/A5/Letter/Legal/Custom), advanced typography controls (leading, tracking, optical margin alignment), CSV data integration for tables, professional PDF export presets, EPUB export, and print production packaging. Includes custom ExtendScript execution for advanced automation.

**chris-enea/indesign-mcp** (9 stars, Python, 4 tools) provides minimal text manipulation — insert, find/replace, delete, and retrieve text through ExtendScript API.

All InDesign servers require **macOS with Adobe InDesign 2025+** installed, as they communicate with InDesign through AppleScript or ExtendScript. This limits practical use to designers who already have InDesign on their machines.

### Adobe Creative Suite MCP

- **Merge in sequence** — combine PDFs in user-specified order
- **Extract pages** — pull specific pages from PDF documents
- **Search PDFs** — find PDF files across the filesystem
- **Consolidate** — identify and merge related PDFs using text extraction and regex matching

At 75 stars, this is the most popular PDF manipulation MCP server. The Unlicense means it's effectively public domain — no licensing restrictions whatsoever.

For PDF reading and text extraction, see our dedicated [PDF & Document MCP review](/reviews/pdf-document-mcp-servers/) which covers the much larger ecosystem of PDF reading servers (SylphxAI/pdf-reader-mcp, document-edit-mcp, and many others).

## What's Missing

The publishing and typesetting MCP space has significant gaps:

- **No EPUB authoring** — servers can read EPUBs and convert to EPUB via Pandoc, but no dedicated EPUB creation/editing tools exist
- **No Amazon KDP integration** — Kindle Direct Publishing is the dominant self-publishing platform, with no MCP server
- **No newspaper/magazine layout** — InDesign servers handle generic layout but nothing targets periodical publishing workflows
- **No Affinity Publisher** — the leading InDesign alternative has no MCP integration
- **No Typst** — the modern LaTeX alternative (growing rapidly in academic publishing) has no MCP server
- **No book cover design tools** — cover creation is a critical self-publishing need with no dedicated MCP solution
- **No ISBN/metadata management** — no tools for managing ISBNs, BISAC codes, or publishing metadata
- **No Kobo/Apple Books publishing** — only Amazon Kindle gets a send-to-device tool; no publishing platform integrations for other e-readers
- **No QuarkXPress** — the legacy desktop publishing tool has no MCP presence
- **No collaborative editing** — real-time co-authoring (Google Docs-style) through MCP doesn't exist

## The Bottom Line

Publishing and typesetting MCP servers cover a wide range of document production needs — from LaTeX compilation to print-on-demand — but the ecosystem is fragmented and uneven.

**Best in class:** markdownify-mcp (2,400 stars) is the standout — a genuine best-in-class tool for getting any document format into AI workflows. mcp-pandoc (512 stars) is the go-to for multi-format conversion including EPUB output. ebook-mcp (351 stars) provides the most comprehensive eBook reading experience.

**Solid foundations:** TeXFlow offers an elegant structured approach to LaTeX authoring. arxiv-latex-mcp solves a real pain point for academic researchers. Printify MCP demonstrates end-to-end AI product creation with integrated image generation.

**Ambitious but limited:** InDesign servers are technically impressive but require macOS + Adobe InDesign, limiting their audience. Overleaf integrations are fragmented across 5+ competing implementations.

The category earns **3.5 out of 5**. Document conversion is genuinely excellent and serves as critical infrastructure for the broader MCP ecosystem. eBook management is unexpectedly mature. LaTeX workflows are well-served despite fragmentation. But desktop publishing remains platform-limited, print production is thin beyond the two POD servers, and the self-publishing pipeline (write → format → publish → distribute) has too many gaps to be considered comprehensive. The absence of Amazon KDP integration is the most glaring omission in a category this focused on publishing.
