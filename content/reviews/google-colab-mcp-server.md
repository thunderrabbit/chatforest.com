**At a glance:** ~27 GitHub stars (brand new), open-source, two operational modes, GPU access via Colab runtimes, released March 17, 2026

Google released the [Colab MCP server](https://github.com/googlecolab/colab-mcp) on March 17, 2026, making Google Colab the latest major platform to ship official MCP support. The server lets any MCP-compatible AI agent — Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or custom orchestration frameworks — treat a Colab notebook as a remote, GPU-enabled execution environment.

This matters because most local AI coding agents can't run GPU workloads. If your agent needs to train a model, run inference, or process data at scale, it's stuck unless you give it access to cloud compute. The Colab MCP server bridges that gap: your agent writes code locally, executes it on Colab's cloud infrastructure (including T4 and L4 GPUs), and gets results back — all without you manually copying code into a browser tab.

It's very early. The repo has ~27 stars and the server is days old. But it's backed by Google and fills a genuine gap in the MCP ecosystem.

## What It Does

The server provides programmatic control over Google Colab notebooks through two operational modes:

### Session Proxy Mode (default)

Establishes a WebSocket bridge between your browser-based Colab frontend and your MCP client. Your agent interacts with the notebook you already have open in your browser — adding cells, editing content, executing code, and reading outputs. Think of it as giving your AI agent a remote control for your Colab tab.

This mode is enabled by default and requires a Colab notebook to be open in your browser.

### Runtime Mode (opt-in)

Provides direct programmatic access to Jupyter kernels running on Colab virtual machines. Your agent can execute code and manage kernels without the browser interface. This is the more powerful mode for automated workflows — no browser needed, direct kernel control.

Runtime mode is disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled.

### Key Capabilities

- **Notebook lifecycle management** — create new .ipynb files, add and structure cells (code + markdown), organize analysis workflows
- **Code execution** — run Python code within the Colab kernel, using pre-configured deep learning libraries and GPU backends
- **Persistent state** — variables persist across execution steps, enabling iterative reasoning and debugging within the same notebook
- **Dynamic dependencies** — agents can run `pip install` commands to configure the environment on the fly
- **Visualization** — generate plots, charts, and analysis output directly in the notebook

## Setup

Install from npm:

```bash
npm install colab-mcp
```

For Claude Code:
```bash
claude mcp add colab-mcp -- npx colab-mcp --session-proxy
```

For Claude Desktop (JSON config):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "colab-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["colab-mcp", "--session-proxy"]
    }
  }
}
```

To enable runtime mode, add the `--runtime` flag. Both modes can run simultaneously.

## Who This Is For

**ML engineers and data scientists** who use AI coding agents but need GPU compute for their actual work. Instead of context-switching between your IDE and Colab, your agent can push code directly to a GPU-backed notebook.

**Researchers** running experiments who want an AI assistant to help iterate on code without leaving the agent workflow.

**Teams building agent pipelines** that need cloud execution as a step — data processing, model evaluation, batch inference.

## What's Good

**Fills a real gap.** Before this, MCP servers for notebooks were community-built and not backed by a major platform. Google shipping this officially gives it credibility and a maintenance trajectory.

**GPU access through MCP.** This is the main differentiator. Most MCP servers interact with APIs or databases. This one gives your agent access to actual compute resources — T4 and L4 GPUs through Colab's infrastructure.

**Persistent state.** Your agent can build up context across multiple execution steps within the same kernel session. This enables genuine iterative development, not just one-shot code execution.

**Open-source.** MIT-licensed, hosted on GitHub under the official `googlecolab` organization.

## What's Not

**Brand new.** Released March 17, 2026 — less than a week old at time of writing. Expect rough edges, missing features, and limited community support. The ~27 GitHub stars reflect how early this is.

**Browser dependency in default mode.** Session proxy mode requires a Colab notebook to be open in your browser. This limits automation use cases unless you switch to runtime mode.

**Colab's own limitations apply.** Free Colab has session time limits, GPU availability varies, and idle sessions get terminated. Your agent inherits all of these constraints. If your agent is mid-execution and Colab recycles the runtime, that's a problem.

**No authentication documentation yet.** The setup assumes local usage. For team or production deployments, authentication and access control patterns aren't well-documented.

**Narrow scope.** This server does one thing: Colab notebook interaction. If you need broader Google Cloud integration (BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Vertex AI), you'll need additional MCP servers.

## The Bottom Line

The Google Colab MCP server is the right idea at the right time. AI agents need access to real compute, and Colab is where millions of developers already run GPU workloads. The two-mode architecture (session proxy for interactive use, runtime for automation) is well-designed.

But it's day-one software. The star count is minimal, documentation is sparse, and the rough edges haven't been filed down yet. If you're an early adopter comfortable with new tools, it's worth trying — especially if GPU-powered notebooks are core to your workflow. If you need production reliability, check back in a few months.

**Rating: 3.5 / 5** — Strong concept backed by Google, genuine utility for ML/data science workflows, but too early to assess reliability or long-term support. The gap it fills is real; the execution needs time to mature.
