**At a glance:** Official HubSpot public beta, two server types (remote CRM + local developer), OAuth 2.0 auth, nine tools at launch, community server (peakmojo) at ~72 GitHub stars

HubSpot launched its [official MCP server](https://developers.hubspot.com/mcp) in public beta, making one of the world's most popular CRMs directly accessible to AI agents through the Model Context Protocol. If you're a sales rep, marketer, or service team member who uses AI coding agents, your agent can now pull contacts, search deals, and review engagement history without you manually querying the HubSpot API.

This is significant. CRM data is among the most valuable context an AI agent can have for business workflows — who your customers are, what deals are in progress, which contacts engaged recently. HubSpot connecting that data to the MCP ecosystem means agents can answer questions like "show me all deals closing this month" or "what's the engagement history for this company" in natural language.

Two server types serve different audiences: the remote MCP server for teams who want AI-powered CRM access, and the developer MCP server for builders creating HubSpot apps with AI assistance.

## What It Does

### Remote MCP Server (CRM Data)

The remote server connects MCP-compatible clients directly to your HubSpot account. Your agent gets structured, authenticated access to CRM objects — contacts, companies, deals, tickets, and their associated engagement data.

Nine tools shipped at launch covering the core workflows that marketing, sales, and service teams use daily. HubSpot has committed to expanding tool coverage throughout 2026.

Key operations include:
- **Contact management** — search, read, and manage contact records
- **Company data** — look up companies, retrieve activity history, review recent engagements
- **Deal tracking** — query deals by stage, close date, owner, or custom properties
- **Engagement history** — pull email opens, meeting logs, call records, and other touchpoints

### Developer MCP Server (Local)

A separate CLI-based server for HubSpot developers. This one helps you build on the HubSpot platform with AI assistance — scaffolding new projects, adding features like app cards and workflow actions, and uploading projects to HubSpot.

This is less about CRM data access and more about accelerating HubSpot app development with agentic tooling.

## Setup

### Remote MCP Server

Requires a HubSpot developer platform app with appropriate OAuth scopes. Add to Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hubspot": {
      "url": "https://mcp.hubspot.com/sse",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You'll need to create a user-level application on the [HubSpot Developer Platform](https://developers.hubspot.com) with read scopes for the CRM objects you want your agent to access.

### Developer MCP Server

Requires HubSpot CLI version 7.60.0 or later:

```bash
npm install -g @hubspot/cli
hs mcp setup
```

The CLI walks you through selecting which agentic tools to enable.

## Who This Is For

**Sales teams** who want AI agents to prep for meetings. Instead of manually pulling up a contact record, your agent can summarize the relationship history, recent communications, and deal status in seconds — what reportedly takes 30 seconds instead of 15 minutes.

**Marketing teams** analyzing lead quality or campaign performance. Your agent can query CRM data to answer questions about conversion rates, lead sources, and engagement patterns without waiting for a BI report.

**HubSpot developers** building custom integrations, workflow actions, or app cards. The developer MCP server accelerates scaffolding and project management.

**RevOps and service managers** monitoring pipeline health, SLA compliance, or customer health scores through conversational queries rather than dashboard navigation.

## What's Good

**Official and well-documented.** This isn't a community wrapper — it's HubSpot's own MCP server with dedicated documentation, a public beta program, and a commitment to expanding tools throughout 2026. That means maintenance and support trajectory.

**OAuth 2.0 authentication.** Proper security model from the start. Access is scoped to specific CRM objects, so you control exactly what your agent can see. This matters for enterprise adoption where data governance is non-negotiable.

**Two-server architecture.** Separating CRM data access (remote server) from developer tooling (local server) is a clean design. Different audiences, different security models, different deployment patterns.

**Massive user base.** HubSpot has over 200,000 customers across 120+ countries. The potential community and ecosystem around this MCP server is substantial — plugins, templates, and workflow recipes are likely to emerge quickly.

**Community alternatives exist.** The [peakmojo/mcp-hubspot](https://github.com/peakmojo/mcp-hubspot) community server (~72 stars) adds vector storage and caching to overcome HubSpot API rate limits. Having both official and community options gives users flexibility.

## What's Not

**Still in beta.** Nine tools at launch is reasonable, but HubSpot's CRM surface area is enormous. Many object types, custom properties, and workflow capabilities aren't yet exposed. If your workflow depends on a specific CRM feature, check whether it's covered before committing.

**HubSpot subscription required.** You need a HubSpot account with appropriate access levels. Free-tier CRM users may find limited utility depending on which scopes and objects are available to them.

**OAuth setup complexity.** While the authentication model is correct for production use, the setup process — creating a developer app, configuring OAuth scopes, managing tokens — is more involved than many community MCP servers that just take an API key. This is a trade-off: better security, more setup friction.

**Write operations unclear.** At launch, the emphasis is on reading and searching CRM data. Whether agents can reliably create contacts, update deal stages, or log activities is less well-documented. For teams wanting full CRUD through their agent, verify write capabilities before planning workflows around them.

**API rate limits apply.** HubSpot's API has rate limits that apply to MCP server calls too. High-frequency agent queries could hit limits, especially on lower-tier plans. The community peakmojo server's caching layer addresses this, but the official server doesn't appear to.

## The Bottom Line

HubSpot's MCP server is one of the most commercially significant MCP launches to date. CRM data is the lifeblood of sales, marketing, and service teams, and connecting it to AI agents through a standardized protocol unlocks real productivity gains. The OAuth security model, official backing, and two-server architecture show thoughtful design.

It's a beta — nine tools, expanding coverage, and rough edges are expected. But HubSpot has the resources and user base to iterate quickly. If your team lives in HubSpot and uses AI agents, this is worth setting up today. If you need advanced features or write operations, the community peakmojo server may fill gaps while HubSpot expands.

**Rating: 4 / 5** — Official backing from a major CRM platform, proper security model, clear roadmap for expansion. Beta limitations and setup complexity are real but expected for an enterprise-grade integration. The CRM-agent connection this enables is genuinely valuable.
