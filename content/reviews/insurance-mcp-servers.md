date: 2026-03-15T23:00:00+09:00
description: "Insurance MCP servers are enabling AI agents to process claims, assess underwriting risk, manage policies, and integrate with insurance platforms — but the category remains very early-stage. We reviewed 15+ servers across 5 subcategories. Claims Processing: ClaimsProcessingAssistant-MCP (TypeScript, Supabase — claim validation rules engine with duplicate detection and AI document analysis via Claude). Policy Management: insurance-mcp-server (Python — premium due tracking, overdue payment detection, customer search, policy summaries, analytics). Salesforce Insurance: mcp-server-salesforce-insurance (Salesforce PCM integration for insurance policy design via natural language, SOQL/SOSL queries, custom object management). Underwriting: AWS sample-quicksuite-chatagent-insurance-underwriting (Python, Apache 2.0 — 6 enterprise tools for fraud detection, risk assessment, and underwriting decisions with Amazon Nova Lite 2.0, DynamoDB, 1,000+ synthetic applicants), Insurance Underwriting Risk & Peril Scoring MCP on Apify (multi-peril scoring, disaster history, seismic/flood exposure, climate trajectory analysis at 5/10/25-year horizons for P&C underwriters). Enterprise Platforms: Socotra MCP Server (commercial — all insurance lines and geographic markets, capability-scoped auth, encrypted sessions, audit trails, 10-minute setup), Sure MCP (commercial — real-time quote generation, policy binding, claims initiation, multi-carrier access, regulatory compliance guardrails), One Inc MCP (commercial — AI-enhanced PremiumPay and ClaimsPay, fraud controls, on-demand reporting). Financial Services: mcp-financial-services/SecureLend (MIT — 20 tools, 10 prompts, 32 resources for loans, banking, credit cards, and insurance comparison, SOC 2 certified, 200+ lenders). Compliance: RegGuard (Python, MIT — regulatory compliance checking for financial marketing content across Singapore, Hong Kong, UAE, India). Rating: 3.0/5."

card_description: "Insurance MCP servers for claims processing, underwriting risk assessment, policy management, and enterprise platform integration. This is one of the most commercially-led MCP categories — enterprise vendors Socotra, Sure, and One Inc have all launched production MCP servers, while open source remains embryonic. ClaimsProcessingAssistant-MCP (TypeScript) provides claim validation with a rules engine covering policy checks, duplicate detection, high-value claim flagging, and AI document analysis via Claude with Supabase backend — the most feature-complete open source insurance MCP server, though with minimal community adoption. The AWS sample-quicksuite-chatagent-insurance-underwriting (Python, Apache 2.0) demonstrates enterprise underwriting with 6 tools, Amazon Nova Lite 2.0 for explainable AI decisions, fraud detection, risk assessment, 1,000+ synthetic applicants, and complete audit trails — a strong reference architecture from AWS. Insurance Underwriting Risk & Peril Scoring on Apify offers a novel pay-per-use model with multi-peril scoring, disaster history, seismic/flood/environmental exposure analysis, and 5/10/25-year climate trajectory projections for P&C underwriters. The insurance-mcp-server (Python) handles basic policy and premium payment management with analytics. The mcp-server-salesforce-insurance bridges Claude Desktop to Salesforce Product Catalog Management for insurance policy design via natural language. On the enterprise side, Socotra launched what they describe as 'the most mature MCP server in the insurance industry' with all-lines coverage, capability-scoped authentication, encrypted agent sessions, and human-in-the-loop checkpoints. Sure claimed the 'insurance industry's first' MCP capability (June 2025) for real-time quote generation, policy binding, claims processing, and multi-carrier access. One Inc (February 2026) enhances PremiumPay and ClaimsPay with MCP for AI-assisted integration, fraud controls, and on-demand reporting. mcp-financial-services from SecureLend (MIT, 20 tools, 32 resources) covers insurance comparison alongside broader financial services with SOC 2 certification. RegGuard (MIT) provides regulatory compliance checking for financial marketing content across 4 jurisdictions. Gaps: no open source underwriting-grade risk models; no actuarial calculation MCP servers; no reinsurance treaty management; no insurance-specific document OCR/extraction (ACORD forms, declarations pages); no telematics/usage-based insurance data integration; no regulatory filing (SERFF/state DOI) tools; no loss ratio or combined ratio analytics. The category earns 3.0/5 — commercial platforms are investing heavily, but open source tooling hasn't followed, leaving individual developers and smaller insurtech companies without accessible MCP infrastructure."

Insurance MCP servers are connecting AI agents to claims processing workflows, underwriting risk assessment, policy management systems, and enterprise insurance platforms. Instead of manually navigating claims queues or underwriting dashboards, an AI agent can validate a claim against policy rules, score multi-peril risk for a property, or generate a real-time insurance quote through standardized MCP tools.

The landscape divides into five areas: **claims processing** (ClaimsProcessingAssistant — rules engine with AI document analysis), **underwriting** (AWS sample with explainable AI decisions, Apify peril scoring for P&C), **policy management** (insurance-mcp-server for premium tracking, Salesforce PCM integration for policy design), **enterprise platforms** (Socotra, Sure, One Inc — production MCP servers from insurance technology vendors), and **financial services** (SecureLend — insurance comparison within broader fintech, RegGuard for marketing compliance).

The headline findings: **commercial vendors are leading the charge** — Socotra, Sure, and One Inc have all shipped production MCP implementations, making insurance one of the most commercially-invested vertical MCP categories. **Open source is embryonic** — most community projects have near-zero stars and are individual experiments rather than production tools. **Underwriting is the hottest subvertical** — multiple implementations target risk assessment specifically. **The gap between enterprise and community is wider than any other category we've reviewed** — there's essentially no middle ground between vendor-locked commercial platforms and single-developer hobby projects.

## Claims Processing

### ClaimsProcessingAssistant-MCP

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [chbhargavareddy/ClaimsProcessingAssistant-MCP](https://github.com/chbhargavareddy/ClaimsProcessingAssistant-MCP) | ~1 | TypeScript | — | Claims workflow |

The **most feature-complete open source insurance MCP server**, built around a claims validation rules engine with Supabase backend. Key capabilities:

- **Claim validation rules engine** — policy checks, duplicate detection, high-value claim flagging, document completeness verification
- **AI document analysis** — uses Claude for intelligent document review within the claims workflow
- **Redis caching** — performance optimization for repeated queries
- **Comprehensive error handling** — structured error responses across the workflow

The architecture is sound — separating validation rules from the AI analysis layer is the right design for insurance claims where auditability matters. The challenge is that this has minimal community adoption (roughly 1 star), meaning no battle-testing, no bug reports, and no contributions from insurance domain experts. For a category where accuracy is critical, that's a meaningful limitation.

### insurance-ai-mcp-server

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [chandan-akshronix/insurance-ai-mcp-server](https://github.com/chandan-akshronix/insurance-ai-mcp-server) | ~0 | Python | — | Claims + underwriting |

A backend MCP server for an **AI Automated Insurance Claim and Underwriting System** using Kafka-based messaging for claim orchestration. Integrates with AI agents, databases, and observability tools (Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry distributed tracing). More of an architectural reference than a ready-to-use tool — the Kafka-based event-driven design is appropriate for insurance workflows where multiple systems need to coordinate on a single claim.

## Policy Management

### insurance-mcp-server

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [wadhawan2411radhika/insurance-mcp-server](https://github.com/wadhawan2411radhika/insurance-mcp-server) | <5 | Python | — | 9+ tools |

A **policy and premium payment management** MCP server for Claude Desktop. Tools include:

- Premium due date tracking and overdue payment detection
- Customer search by name, policy lookup by ID
- Payment history retrieval
- Policy summaries grouped by type
- Average premium calculation
- Multi-policy customer identification
- Analytics and reporting

Supports custom database paths via `INSURANCE_DB_PATH` and optional WhatsApp MCP integration for notifications. This is a practical, if basic, implementation — the kind of tool a small insurance agency could use to give their AI assistant access to policy data. The limitation is the SQLite-based storage, which wouldn't scale to a real insurance book of business.

### mcp-server-salesforce-insurance

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [bruteforce17/mcp-server-salesforce-insurance](https://github.com/bruteforce17/mcp-server-salesforce-insurance) | ~0 | — | — | Salesforce PCM |

Connects Claude Desktop and Cursor to **Salesforce Product Catalog Management (PCM)** for insurance. Enables insurance policy design through natural language with SOQL queries, relationship support, Apex class management, cross-object search via SOSL, and full CRUD operations. For insurance companies already on Salesforce (which is many), this bridges the gap between their existing CRM/policy admin system and AI agents. Salesforce-specific error handling is included.

## Underwriting & Risk Assessment

### AWS Insurance Underwriting Sample

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [aws-samples/sample-quicksuite-chatagent-insurance-underwriting](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-quicksuite-chatagent-insurance-underwriting) | ~0 | Python | Apache 2.0 | 6 |

The **strongest reference architecture** for insurance underwriting MCP, from AWS. Six enterprise tools covering:

- **Fraud detection** — pattern analysis across applicant data
- **Risk assessment** — multi-factor evaluation
- **Underwriting decisions** — explainable AI via Amazon Nova Lite 2.0
- **Data integration** — DynamoDB + S3 backend
- **Audit trails** — complete decision logging
- **OAuth 2.0** — inbound authorization for security

Ships with 1,000+ synthetic applicants and 500+ claims for testing. Deployable via Amazon Bedrock AgentCore. While this is a sample project (not production-ready), it demonstrates the right patterns for AI-assisted underwriting: explainable decisions, audit trails, and fraud detection as a first-class concern. Insurance companies evaluating MCP for underwriting should start here.

### Insurance Underwriting Risk & Peril Scoring (Apify)

| Server | Stars | Platform | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| Insurance Underwriting Intelligence MCP | — | Apify | Pay-per-use | 8 actors |

A **novel pay-per-use MCP** for property & casualty underwriting, wrapping 8 specialized actors:

- Multi-peril risk scoring
- Disaster history analysis
- Seismic and flood exposure assessment
- Environmental liability evaluation
- Crime proximity scoring
- Climate trajectory analysis at **5-, 10-, and 25-year horizons**

This is one of the few MCP servers designed specifically for **P&C underwriters** making risk decisions. The climate trajectory feature is particularly forward-looking — most underwriting tools provide point-in-time risk scores, while this one models how risk evolves over policy periods. The pay-per-use model (via Apify credits) means no upfront investment, though it also means data processing happens on Apify's infrastructure rather than in-house.

A related server from the same developer covers **Construction Contractor Risk & Project Underwriting** — OSHA/EPA data for contractor risk scoring, site hazard evaluation, safety record audits, and environmental compliance. Useful for construction and contractor insurance lines.

## Enterprise Platforms

The commercial side of insurance MCP is significantly more mature than open source. Three vendors have shipped production implementations:

### Socotra MCP Server

| Server | Type | Launched | Coverage |
|--------|------|----------|----------|
| [Socotra MCP Server](https://docs.socotra.com/aiGuide/mcpServer/mcpServerOverview.html) | Commercial | September 2025 | All lines |

Socotra describes this as **"the most mature MCP server in the insurance industry."** Key features:

- **All insurance lines** and geographic markets
- **Capability-scoped authentication** — AI agents get precisely the permissions they need
- **Encrypted agent sessions** — security model built for insurance regulatory requirements
- **Complete audit trails** — every AI action logged and traceable
- **Human-in-the-loop checkpoints** — configurable approval gates
- **10-minute setup** for Claude Desktop, VS Code, and Cursor

For insurance companies already on the Socotra platform, this is the most comprehensive MCP integration available. The capability-scoped auth is the right security model for insurance — AI agents shouldn't have blanket access to all policy data.

### Sure MCP

| Server | Type | Launched | Coverage |
|--------|------|----------|----------|
| Sure MCP | Commercial | June 2025 | Quote/bind/service |

Sure claimed the **"insurance industry's first" MCP capability** when they launched in June 2025. Capabilities:

- Real-time insurance quote generation
- Policy binding decisions
- Policy change processing
- Claims initiation
- Customer service interactions
- **Regulatory compliance guardrails** — built-in
- **Multi-carrier access** — aggregate across insurance carriers

The community has built an unofficial wrapper ([robcerda/sure-mcp-server](https://github.com/robcerda/sure-mcp-server), Python) that connects Claude Desktop to Sure's API for those who want to experiment outside Sure's enterprise offering. Requires `SURE_API_URL` and `SURE_API_KEY` configuration.

### One Inc MCP

| Server | Type | Launched | Coverage |
|--------|------|----------|----------|
| One Inc MCP | Commercial | February 2026 | Payments |

The newest entrant, launched February 2026, enhancing One Inc's PremiumPay and ClaimsPay solutions:

- Operates within each customer's **IT-approved AI environment** (not centralized)
- Permissioned and auditable data access
- AI-assisted code generation for developer integrations
- Automated testing capabilities
- **Fraud controls** — critical for payment processing
- On-demand business reporting
- Supports Claude, ChatGPT Enterprise, and Microsoft Copilot

One Inc's approach is notably different from Socotra and Sure — rather than exposing insurance operations through MCP, they're using MCP to make their payment platform more developer-accessible. The focus is on integration acceleration rather than AI-driven insurance decisions.

## Financial Services & Compliance

### mcp-financial-services (SecureLend)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [SecureLend/mcp-financial-services](https://github.com/SecureLend/mcp-financial-services) | — | — | MIT | 20 tools, 32 resources |

A **cross-vertical financial services MCP** covering loans, banking, credit cards, and insurance:

- 20 tools, 10 prompts, 32 resources
- Insurance comparison functionality
- **SOC 2 Type 2 certified** — rare for an MCP server
- Connects to 200+ lenders via Skybridge Framework
- Claude Desktop extension (.mcpb file)
- AWS backend (DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway, S3)

This isn't insurance-specific, but the insurance comparison features and SOC 2 certification make it relevant for insurance distribution workflows. The compliance certification is notable — most MCP servers have no formal security auditing.

### RegGuard

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [Elnino0009/regguard-mcp](https://github.com/Elnino0009/regguard-mcp) | — | Python | MIT | Compliance checking |

AI-powered **regulatory compliance checking** for financial marketing content using GPT-4o-mini. Supports Singapore, Hong Kong, UAE, and India jurisdictions. Automatically inserts regulatory disclaimers and analyzes content for violations. Relevant to insurance marketing compliance — insurance advertising is heavily regulated, and this tool could catch violations before publication. The multi-jurisdiction support is practical for insurers operating across Asian markets.

## Industry Context

The insurance MCP ecosystem is shaped by several industry-specific forces:

**Regulation drives caution.** Insurance is one of the most heavily regulated industries globally. Every state in the US has its own insurance department, and AI in underwriting faces scrutiny around bias and fairness. This explains why commercial vendors (with compliance teams) are ahead of open source contributors.

**Commercial vendors see MCP as differentiation.** Socotra, Sure, and One Inc are all competing for insurtech platform market share. MCP integration is a competitive feature — it signals that their platform is AI-ready. This is why the commercial ecosystem is more developed than in many other MCP categories.

**The actuarial gap is glaring.** There are no MCP servers for actuarial calculations — loss reserving, pricing models, experience rating, or catastrophe modeling. Given that actuarial science is the mathematical core of insurance, this is a significant gap that likely reflects the specialized nature of actuarial tooling (SAS, R, proprietary models).

**Industry thought leaders are watching.** Allianz has published on MCP for unlocking legacy insurance systems. Root Platform has explored MCP as "the future of insurance." Sixfold AI is developing MCP connections for underwriting risk models. The interest is there; the open source implementations haven't followed yet.

## What's Missing

The gaps in insurance MCP tooling are extensive:

- **Actuarial calculations** — no loss reserving, pricing, experience rating, or cat modeling
- **ACORD forms** — no OCR/extraction for the industry-standard insurance document format
- **Reinsurance** — no treaty management, cession tracking, or bordereaux processing
- **Regulatory filing** — no SERFF or state DOI integration for rate/form filings
- **Telematics** — no usage-based insurance data integration (connected car, wearables)
- **Loss ratio analytics** — no combined ratio, loss development, or triangle analysis
- **Agency management** — no tools for independent agent workflows (commission tracking, carrier appointments)
- **Catastrophe modeling** — no integration with AIR, RMS, or CoreLogic models

## The Bottom Line

Insurance MCP servers earn **3.0 out of 5**. The commercial ecosystem is surprisingly developed — Socotra, Sure, and One Inc have all shipped production MCP implementations, making insurance one of the most vendor-invested vertical MCP categories. But the open source landscape is among the weakest we've reviewed. Most community projects have near-zero stars and represent individual experiments rather than production-ready tools.

The AWS underwriting sample provides a strong reference architecture, and the Apify underwriting intelligence MCP offers a novel pay-per-use model for P&C risk scoring. But there's no community momentum building toward shared, open infrastructure. For a $6+ trillion global industry, the contrast between vendor investment and community contribution is stark.

**Best for:** Insurance companies already on Socotra, Sure, or One Inc platforms who want to add AI agent capabilities. The AWS sample is the best starting point for custom underwriting MCP development.

**Skip if:** You need open source insurance tooling you can self-host and customize — it doesn't meaningfully exist yet. Consider building on the AWS sample or waiting for the ecosystem to mature.
