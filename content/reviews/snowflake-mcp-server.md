**At a glance:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/mcp) — 261 stars, 81 forks, Python, 6 tool domains. [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/snowflake-labs-mcp/) — snowflake-labs-mcp. Official first-party from [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/). Apache 2.0 license. Two deployment options: open-source server + managed cloud endpoint (GA). Part of our **[Data & Analytics](/categories/data-analytics/)** category.

The Snowflake MCP Server is the **official first-party MCP integration** for working with the [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) Data Cloud. It provides AI assistants with access to Snowflake's Cortex AI suite — search over unstructured data, natural language to SQL via semantic models, agentic orchestration across data sources — plus SQL execution with fine-grained permission controls, database object management, and semantic view querying.

[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) was founded in 2012 by Benoit Dageville, Thierry Cruanes, and Marcin Żukowski. The company pioneered cloud-native data warehousing with separation of storage and compute. As of fiscal year 2026: ~8,240 employees, $4.68B annual revenue (29% YoY growth), ~$60B market cap. Snowflake is publicly traded on NYSE (SNOW).

Snowflake offers **two MCP deployment options**: an open-source local server (Snowflake-Labs/mcp on GitHub) and a **managed MCP endpoint** built into the Snowflake platform (GA since November 2025). This review covers both, with emphasis on the open-source server.

## What It Does

The server provides integrated tooling across **six primary domains**:

### Cortex Search

Query unstructured data in Snowflake, commonly used in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. Search services are configured per database/schema with descriptive labels for the LLM to select the right source.

### Cortex Analyst

Query structured data via **semantic views** — Snowflake's approach to natural language SQL generation. The LLM describes what it wants, and Cortex Analyst generates the SQL based on the semantic model's business logic and relationships.

### Cortex Agent

Agentic orchestration across both structured and unstructured data sources. Cortex Agents combine Cortex Search and Cortex Analyst capabilities into a single tool that can reason across multiple data domains.

### Object Management

| Operation | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| Create objects | Create databases, schemas, tables, views |
| Drop objects | Remove database objects |
| Alter objects | Modify existing object properties |
| Describe objects | Get object metadata and structure |

### SQL Execution (Query Manager)

Run LLM-generated SQL with **user-configured permissions**. The permission system uses allowlists and blocklists to control which SQL statement types are permitted:

```yaml
sql_statement_permissions:
  - type: SELECT
    permission: ALLOW
  - type: CREATE
    permission: ALLOW
  - type: DROP
    permission: DENY
  - type: DELETE
    permission: DENY
```

This is a standout safety feature — you can let AI assistants query data while preventing destructive operations.

### Semantic View Querying (Semantic Manager)

Discover and interact with Snowflake's semantic views, which provide business-friendly abstractions over raw database tables.

## Setup & Configuration

The open-source server is installed and run via `uvx`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "snowflake": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "snowflake-labs-mcp",
        "--service-config-file", "/path/to/config.yaml",
        "--account", "your-account",
        "--user", "your-user",
        "--password", "your-password"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Service Configuration

Services are declared in YAML with three categories:

```yaml
agent_services:
  - name: "my_agent"
    description: "Orchestrates across sales and support data"
    database: "MY_DB"
    schema: "PUBLIC"

search_services:
  - name: "doc_search"
    description: "Search internal documentation"
    database: "DOCS_DB"
    schema: "PUBLIC"

analyst_services:
  - name: "revenue_analyst"
    description: "Revenue and financial metrics"
    semantic_model: "@MY_DB.PUBLIC.REVENUE_MODEL"

other_services:
  object_manager: true
  query_manager: true
  semantic_manager: true
```

### Authentication Methods

The server leverages the Snowflake Python Connector and supports:

| Method | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| Username/password | Quick setup, development |
| Key pair | CI/CD, service accounts |
| OAuth tokens | Enterprise SSO integration |
| MFA | Multi-factor authentication |
| SSO | Single sign-on via browser |

Connection parameters can be passed as CLI arguments or environment variables (`SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT`, `SNOWFLAKE_USER`, `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD`, `SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATE_KEY`, etc.).

### Transport Options

| Transport | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **stdio** (default) | Local development, direct client integration |
| **sse** (legacy) | Server-Sent Events for streaming |
| **streamable-http** | Container/remote deployments (port 9000, `/mcp` endpoint) |

### Supported AI Clients

Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code with GitHub Copilot, Codex CLI, fast-agent.

### Docker Deployment

Docker and Docker Compose configurations are provided for containerized deployments, with environment variable injection for credentials and volume mounting for config files.

## Managed MCP Server (Cloud Endpoint)

Snowflake also offers a **managed MCP endpoint** built directly into the platform — no separate server to deploy. This went GA in November 2025.

### Managed Server Tools

| Tool Type | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| `CORTEX_SEARCH_SERVICE_QUERY` | Unstructured data search |
| `CORTEX_ANALYST_MESSAGE` | Natural language to SQL (semantic views only) |
| `SYSTEM_EXECUTE_SQL` | Direct SQL query execution |
| `CORTEX_AGENT_RUN` | Invoke Cortex Agents as tools |
| `GENERIC` | Custom UDFs and stored procedures |

### Managed Server Setup

Created via SQL:

```sql
CREATE MCP SERVER my_mcp_server
  FROM SPECIFICATION $$
    tools:
      - name: "search_docs"
        type: "CORTEX_SEARCH_SERVICE_QUERY"
        identifier: "my_db.my_schema.doc_search"
        description: "Search internal documentation"
  $$;
```

**Endpoint format:** `https://<account_URL>/api/v2/databases/{db}/schemas/{schema}/mcp-servers/{name}`

### Managed Server Authentication

OAuth 2.0 via Snowflake security integrations. Snowflake explicitly recommends OAuth over hardcoded tokens to prevent credential leakage.

### Managed Server Limitations

- No resources, prompts, roots, or notifications support
- No streaming responses
- No version negotiation
- Semantic views only (not semantic models) for Cortex Analyst
- Not available in government regions

## Development History

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| October 2, 2025 | Snowflake-managed MCP server enters Public Preview |
| November 4, 2025 | Managed MCP server reaches General Availability |
| 2025–2026 | Open-source server (Snowflake-Labs/mcp) actively developed |
| March 2026 | 261 GitHub stars, 81 forks, active PR and issue activity |

The managed server launched alongside Snowflake Cortex AI for Financial Services, signaling Snowflake's investment in AI-native data access. The open-source server provides broader flexibility with local deployment and additional transport options.

## Pricing Impact

The **MCP servers themselves are free** — both the open-source server (Apache 2.0) and the managed endpoint. However, all operations run against Snowflake, which uses consumption-based pricing:

| Edition | Credit Price (On-Demand) | Key Features |
|---------|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Standard** | ~$2/credit | Core warehousing, 1-day Time Travel |
| **Enterprise** | ~$2.50/credit | 90-day Time Travel, multi-cluster warehouses |
| **Business Critical** | ~$3/credit | HIPAA/HITRUST, customer-managed encryption |
| **Virtual Private** | Contact sales | Isolated environment, strictest compliance |

Cortex AI features (Search, Analyst, Agents) consume additional credits based on usage. Prepaid capacity contracts offer 15-40% discounts over on-demand pricing.

## Comparison with Alternatives

| Feature | Snowflake-Labs MCP (Official) | isaacwasserman MCP | dynamike MCP | Managed Endpoint |
|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Official** | Yes (Snowflake Labs) | Community | Community | Yes (first-party) |
| **Focus** | Full platform (Cortex + SQL + objects) | SQL queries + schema | Read-only queries | Cortex AI + SQL + custom tools |
| **Cortex AI** | Search, Analyst, Agent | No | No | Search, Analyst, Agent |
| **SQL execution** | Yes (permission-gated) | Yes (read/write) | Yes (read-only) | Yes |
| **Object management** | Yes (create, drop, alter) | No | No | Via custom UDFs |
| **Auth** | Password, key pair, OAuth, SSO, MFA | Password, key pair | Password | OAuth 2.0 |
| **Transport** | stdio, SSE, HTTP | stdio | stdio | HTTPS (managed) |
| **Deployment** | Local (uvx/Docker) | Local (uvx) | Local | Cloud (zero infrastructure) |
| **Stars** | 261 | 142 | 11 | N/A |
| **License** | Apache 2.0 | GPL v3 | MIT | Proprietary |

**Snowflake-Labs MCP vs isaacwasserman's server:** The official server integrates deeply with Cortex AI (Search, Analyst, Agents) — capabilities the community server doesn't offer. isaacwasserman's server focuses on direct SQL execution and schema discovery, with a simpler setup and an insights memo feature that summarizes discovered data patterns. For pure SQL workflows, either works; for Cortex AI, only the official server applies.

**Open-source vs Managed endpoint:** The managed endpoint requires zero infrastructure — just a `CREATE MCP SERVER` SQL statement — and provides built-in OAuth, RBAC, and Snowflake-managed security. The open-source server offers more flexibility: local deployment, Docker containers, multiple transports, and the full object management toolkit. Organizations with strict compliance requirements may prefer the managed endpoint; developers wanting maximum control will prefer the open-source server.

## Known Issues

1. **Hostname underscore bug** — Hostnames containing underscores cause connection failures. Use hyphens instead. This is a known gotcha that affects users with certain Snowflake account identifiers
2. **Semantic views only (managed)** — The managed MCP server's Cortex Analyst tool only supports semantic views, not the older semantic models format. Organizations with existing semantic models must migrate to semantic views
3. **No streaming responses (managed)** — The managed endpoint does not support streaming, which can be noticeable for large result sets or complex queries
4. **Permission granularity complexity** — The managed endpoint requires separate permission grants for the MCP server itself and for each individual tool. This is good for security but can be tedious to configure for many tools
5. **Government region exclusion** — The managed MCP server is not available in Snowflake government regions, limiting options for public sector organizations
6. **Tool poisoning risk** — Snowflake warns that using multiple MCP servers without verification can lead to tool poisoning or tool shadowing vulnerabilities. They recommend verifying third-party servers before use
7. **Deprecated CLI arguments** — Several CLI arguments (`--account-identifier`, `--pat`) are deprecated in favor of new names (`--account`, `--password`). Documentation and examples may still reference the old names
8. **Open issues on GitHub** — 16 open issues as of review, indicating active development but also unresolved bugs in the open-source server

## The Bottom Line

**Rating: 4 out of 5**

The Snowflake MCP Server earns its rating through **official first-party backing from a major data platform** ($4.68B revenue, ~8,240 employees), **deep Cortex AI integration** that no community server offers (Search for RAG, Analyst for natural language SQL, Agents for multi-source orchestration), and a **thoughtful SQL permission system** that lets you control exactly which statement types AI assistants can execute. The dual deployment model — open-source local server plus managed cloud endpoint — gives organizations flexibility to choose based on their security and infrastructure requirements.

It loses a point for **managed endpoint limitations** (no streaming, no semantic models, no government regions), **setup complexity** for the open-source server (YAML configuration, authentication, service declarations), and **ecosystem maturity** — at 261 stars and 16 open issues, the open-source server is still maturing compared to more established MCP implementations. The hostname underscore bug is a surprising rough edge for an enterprise product.

For data engineers and analysts working with Snowflake, this MCP server unlocks AI-assisted data exploration that goes well beyond raw SQL. The Cortex Search integration enables RAG over your unstructured data, Cortex Analyst turns natural language into SQL through semantic models, and the permission-gated SQL execution provides a safety net against destructive operations. If you're already invested in the Snowflake ecosystem, the managed endpoint offers the easiest path to getting started — a single `CREATE MCP SERVER` statement with built-in OAuth and RBAC.
