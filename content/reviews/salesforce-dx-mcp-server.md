**At a glance:** [GitHub](https://github.com/salesforcecli/mcp) — 323 stars, TypeScript, 60+ tools, stdio transport. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@salesforce/mcp) — @salesforce/mcp v0.26.9, ~105K monthly downloads. Official first-party from [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/). Apache 2.0 license. Beta/pilot status.

The Salesforce DX MCP Server is the **official first-party MCP integration** for developers building on the [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) platform. It provides AI assistants with deep access to Salesforce development workflows — deploying metadata, running SOQL queries, analyzing code quality, managing DevOps Center pipelines, building Lightning Web Components, and migrating Aura components to LWC.

[Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) was founded in 1999 by Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez. The company pioneered cloud-based CRM and has grown into the world's largest enterprise software company by revenue. As of fiscal year 2026 (ending January 31, 2026): ~76,400 employees, $41.5B annual revenue (up 10% YoY), ~$186B market cap. Salesforce is publicly traded on NYSE (CRM). The DX MCP server launched in June 2025 as part of Salesforce's broader MCP strategy announced alongside Agentforce 3.

Beyond the DX MCP server, Salesforce's MCP ecosystem includes the **Heroku Platform MCP Server** (GA, 30+ tools for app management) and the **MuleSoft MCP Server** (GA, integration platform management). This review focuses on the DX MCP server, with context on the broader ecosystem.

## What It Does

- **Users** — User and permission management
- **Testing** — Code and feature testing workflows
- **Scale Products** — Apex performance detection and optimization
- **Mobile** — Mobile development capabilities including AR space capture
- **Mobile Core** — Essential mobile features subset

## Setup & Configuration

The server requires the **Salesforce CLI** (`sf`) with at least one authorized org. Install via npx:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "salesforce-dx": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@salesforce/mcp", "--orgs", "DEFAULT_TARGET_ORG"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add salesforce-dx -- npx -y @salesforce/mcp --orgs DEFAULT_TARGET_ORG
```

### Org Access Options

| `--orgs` Value | What It Does |
|----------------|-------------|
| `DEFAULT_TARGET_ORG` | Uses your default configured org |
| `DEFAULT_TARGET_DEV_HUB` | Uses your default dev hub |
| `ALLOW_ALL_ORGS` | Grants access to all authorized orgs |
| `username@example.com` | Specific org by username or alias |

### Command-Line Flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--toolsets` | Enable specific tool groups (e.g., `--toolsets data,metadata,lwc-experts`) |
| `--tools` | Enable individual tools by name |
| `--allow-non-ga-tools` | Enable experimental/non-GA tools |
| `--dynamic-tools` | Experimental: dynamic tool discovery to reduce initial context |
| `--no-telemetry` | Disable telemetry collection |
| `--debug` | Print debug logs |

### Supported AI Clients

Claude Code, Cline, Cursor, Trae, Windsurf, Zed, VS Code (with Copilot).

### Selective Tool Loading

With 60+ tools, loading everything can overwhelm LLM context windows. The `--toolsets` flag lets you load only what you need:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "salesforce-dx": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@salesforce/mcp", "--orgs", "DEFAULT_TARGET_ORG", "--toolsets", "data,metadata,code-analysis"]
    }
  }
}
```

The experimental `--dynamic-tools` flag takes this further by discovering tools on-demand rather than loading them all upfront.

## Development History

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| June 23, 2025 | Salesforce announces MCP support across the platform |
| June 2025 | DX MCP Server launched (Developer Preview) |
| August 27, 2025 | Issue tracking moved from salesforcecli/mcp to forcedotcom/mcp |
| March 2026 | v0.26.9 released (latest as of review) |
| Ongoing | 323 GitHub stars, 81 forks, 684 commits, ~105K monthly npm downloads, 26+ npm releases |

The server has been actively developed since launch, with 684 commits and 26+ releases in ~9 months. The rapid iteration from v0.1 to v0.26 reflects active feature expansion, particularly in LWC tooling and DevOps Center integration.

## Pricing Impact

The **DX MCP server itself is free** and open source (Apache 2.0). However, it operates against Salesforce orgs, which require Salesforce licenses:

| Edition | Price | Use Case |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Developer** | Free | Development and testing (limited features) |
| **Enterprise** | From $165/user/mo | Full CRM + customization |
| **Unlimited** | From $330/user/mo | Advanced support + customization |
| **Einstein 1** | From $500/user/mo | AI features + Data Cloud |

DevOps Center is available in **Enterprise edition and above**. The DX MCP server works with any org edition, including free Developer Edition orgs.

For the broader Salesforce MCP ecosystem:

- **Heroku MCP Server** — Free to use, but Heroku hosting starts at $5/mo (Eco dynos) to $25/mo (Basic)
- **MuleSoft MCP Server** — Free to use, but MuleSoft Anypoint Platform pricing is enterprise-only (contact sales)

## Salesforce MCP Ecosystem

Salesforce offers three official MCP servers, each targeting a different domain:

| Server | Status | Tools | Focus |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| **DX MCP** | Developer Preview (Beta) | 60+ | Salesforce development workflows |
| **Heroku MCP** | Generally Available | 30+ | Heroku app management, PostgreSQL, pipelines |
| **MuleSoft MCP** | Generally Available | Integration tools | API management, Mule app deployment |

Additionally, **Agentforce** (Salesforce's AI agent platform) is adding native MCP client support (Pilot, July 2025 target), with enterprise-grade MCP Server registry and governance. Salesforce is also piloting **hosted MCP servers** for direct platform API access.

## Comparison with Alternatives

| Feature | Salesforce DX MCP | SurajAdsul MCP | CodeFriar sf-mcp | Advanced Communities MCP |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| **Official** | Yes (first-party) | Community | Community | Community |
| **Focus** | Dev workflows (deploy, LWC, code analysis) | Data operations (CRUD, SOQL, SOSL) | CLI command exposure | Data + admin operations |
| **Tools** | 60+ across 15 toolsets | ~15 (CRUD + schema) | All SF CLI commands | 50+ |
| **Auth** | Salesforce CLI pre-auth | Username/password or OAuth | Salesforce CLI | Username/password |
| **Transport** | stdio | stdio | stdio | stdio |
| **LWC support** | 20+ dedicated tools | No | No | No |
| **Code analysis** | Yes (4 tools) | No | No | No |
| **DevOps Center** | Yes (9 tools) | No | No | No |
| **Data operations** | SOQL queries only | Full CRUD + SOSL + schema | Via CLI commands | Full CRUD + admin |
| **License** | Apache 2.0 | MIT | MIT | ISC |
| **npm downloads** | ~105K/mo | ~1K/mo | N/A | ~6K/mo |

**Salesforce DX MCP vs SurajAdsul's MCP Server:** These serve fundamentally different purposes. The DX MCP server is for *developers building on the platform* — deploying code, creating LWC components, running code analysis, managing DevOps workflows. SurajAdsul's server is for *interacting with Salesforce data* — querying records, creating objects, managing schemas via natural language. Many Salesforce developers will want both.

**Salesforce DX MCP vs CodeFriar's sf-mcp:** CodeFriar's approach exposes all Salesforce CLI commands as MCP tools through dynamic discovery. The DX MCP server provides curated, purpose-built tools with richer context and guidance. CodeFriar's is more flexible but less structured.

**Unique advantage:** The DX MCP server is the only Salesforce MCP implementation with **dedicated LWC tooling** (20+ tools for component creation, testing, accessibility, design-to-code conversion) and **DevOps Center integration** (9 tools for the full CI/CD pipeline). No community server comes close to this depth for platform development.

## Known Issues

1. **Beta/pilot status** — The DX MCP server is explicitly marked as a "pilot or beta service" subject to Salesforce's Beta Services Terms. Features may change, break, or be removed without notice. Not recommended for production-critical workflows without fallback plans
2. **Requires Salesforce CLI pre-authentication** — Unlike servers that handle auth inline, you must first authenticate your Salesforce org via `sf org login` before the MCP server can connect. This adds a setup step that can trip up new users
3. **60+ tools can overwhelm context** — Loading all toolsets at once consumes significant LLM context window space. The `--toolsets` flag mitigates this but requires knowing which tools you need upfront. The `--dynamic-tools` experimental flag helps but is not yet stable
4. **Metadata deployment issues** — Multiple open issues report problems with `deploy_metadata` failing to recognize changed metadata, providing insufficient error details, or generating invalid paths in certain IDEs (particularly Zed)
5. **Zed IDE compatibility** — Two open issues (#3, #4) report argument validation errors and incorrect metadata paths when using Zed. Claude Code, Cursor, and VS Code appear more reliable
6. **SOQL-only data access** — The `run_soql_query` tool supports reads but there are no tools for creating, updating, or deleting records. For data manipulation, you need a community MCP server like SurajAdsul's
7. **Telemetry enabled by default** — The server collects usage telemetry unless you explicitly pass `--no-telemetry`
8. **JWT authentication issues** — Open issue #10 reports problems with JWT-based auth and metadata deployment, which can affect CI/CD environments that use certificate-based authentication

## The Bottom Line

**Rating: 4 out of 5**

The Salesforce DX MCP Server earns its rating through **official first-party backing from the world's largest enterprise software company** ($41.5B revenue, ~76,400 employees), an **unmatched depth of 60+ tools** organized into logical toolsets, and **capabilities no community server offers** — particularly the 20+ LWC development tools, 9 DevOps Center tools, and integrated code analysis. The selective toolset loading is a thoughtful design for managing context window constraints. At ~105K monthly npm downloads, it's already seeing significant adoption.

It loses a point for **beta/pilot status** (features may change without notice), **SOQL-only data access** (no CRUD operations for records), and **metadata deployment bugs** that appear across multiple open issues. The requirement for Salesforce CLI pre-authentication adds friction compared to servers that handle auth inline.

For Salesforce developers, the DX MCP server is a powerful addition to your workflow — especially if you work with Lightning Web Components, where the 20+ dedicated tools for component creation, testing, accessibility, and design-to-code conversion are unmatched. For data-focused work (querying records, managing objects), pair it with a community server like SurajAdsul's. For the full Salesforce AI development stack, combine it with the Heroku and MuleSoft MCP servers to cover deployment, integration, and platform management.
