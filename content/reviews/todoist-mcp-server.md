---

The Todoist MCP server is Doist's official bridge between AI assistants and their task management platform. It's part of a broader `todoist-ai` SDK — the tools aren't just for MCP but can be imported directly into custom AI applications. The MCP server is one distribution surface for a reusable tool library.

The server provides 28+ tools covering the full task lifecycle: creating and finding tasks, managing projects and sections, commenting, handling assignments, tracking activity, and even searching across your entire Todoist workspace. A hosted endpoint at `ai.todoist.net/mcp` means zero local installation for most users.

What sets this apart from community Todoist MCP servers: it's the official implementation, actively developed, with MCP Apps support for rendering interactive task widgets directly in chat interfaces.

The key question: does the official server deliver enough to replace the half-dozen community alternatives?

## What It Does

The Todoist MCP server exposes tools across seven functional categories:

**Task management (7 tools):**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `add-tasks` | Create new tasks with titles, descriptions, due dates, priorities, labels |
| `find-tasks` | Search tasks with filtering |
| `find-tasks-by-date` | Locate tasks within specific timeframes |
| `find-completed-tasks` | Retrieve finished tasks |
| `complete-tasks` | Mark tasks as done |
| `uncomplete-tasks` | Reopen completed tasks |
| `update-tasks` | Modify task properties |

**Project management (5 tools):**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `add-projects` | Create new projects |
| `find-projects` | Search projects |
| `update-projects` | Edit project details |
| `project-management` | General project operations |
| `project-move` | Relocate projects within hierarchy |

**Sections (3 tools):**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `add-sections` | Create project sections |
| `find-sections` | Search sections |
| `update-sections` | Modify section details |

**Comments & collaboration (5 tools):**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `add-comments` | Add comments to tasks or projects |
| `find-comments` | Search comments |
| `update-comments` | Edit existing comments |
| `manage-assignments` | Handle task assignments in shared projects |
| `find-project-collaborators` | List project members |

**Labels & organization (2 tools):**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `add-labels` | Create labels |
| `find-labels` | Search labels |

**Information & search (4 tools):**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `user-info` | Retrieve account details |
| `list-workspaces` | Display available workspaces |
| `get-overview` | Dashboard summary of current state |
| `find-activity` | Activity tracking and history |

**Data operations (3 tools):**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search` | General search (OpenAI MCP spec compliant) |
| `fetch` / `fetch-object` | Retrieve specific data objects |
| `delete-object` | Delete tasks, projects, or other objects |

The `get-overview` tool is a nice design choice — it gives agents a quick snapshot of your Todoist state without requiring multiple calls to list tasks, projects, and sections separately.

## Setup

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http todoist https://ai.todoist.net/mcp
```

Launch Claude, run `/mcp`, select the todoist server, and authenticate via browser.

**Claude Desktop / claude.ai:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "todoist": {
      "url": "https://ai.todoist.net/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Cursor / VS Code (via mcp-remote):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "todoist": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://ai.todoist.net/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Local stdio (for development or custom setups):**

```bash
npx @doist/todoist-ai
```

The hosted endpoint is the recommended path. First connection triggers a browser-based OAuth wizard — authorize with your Todoist account and you're connected. No API keys to manage locally.

## Authentication

OAuth 2.0 via browser-based authorization flow. The hosted server at `ai.todoist.net/mcp` handles the OAuth dance — you authenticate in your browser, and your MCP client stores tokens locally. No API keys stored on disk.

For local development or direct SDK usage, you can use a `TODOIST_API_KEY` environment variable with a personal API token (Settings > Integrations > Developer in Todoist).

The transport protocol support is comprehensive:
- **Streamable HTTP** at `https://ai.todoist.net/mcp` — the primary hosted endpoint
- **SSE** (Server-Sent Events) — supported for clients that need it
- **stdio** — local process execution via `npx @doist/todoist-ai`

All three transports in one server is rare. Among the productivity MCP servers we've reviewed, only Todoist offers this flexibility — Linear and Notion have moved to hosted-only or are deprecating non-HTTP transports.

## What's Good

**The SDK-first architecture is forward-thinking.** Most MCP servers are just MCP servers — tools built specifically for the MCP protocol. Todoist-ai inverts this: it's a reusable tool library that happens to expose an MCP server as one interface. The same tools can be imported into Vercel AI SDK projects, custom agent pipelines, or any TypeScript application. This means the tools get tested and used across more surfaces, which tends to improve quality.

**Three transport protocols covers every client.** Streamable HTTP for hosted deployments, SSE for clients that need it, and stdio for local development. You're not locked into one client ecosystem. Claude Desktop uses HTTP, Cursor uses mcp-remote, Claude Code uses HTTP directly, and you can run it locally for custom agent work — all with the same server.

**MCP Apps bring interactive UI to chat.** Instead of plain text task lists, Todoist can render interactive widgets directly in chat interfaces. This isn't just cosmetic — interactive task lists, checkable items, and visual project overviews are genuinely more useful than text dumps. This is early (supported in limited clients), but it's the direction MCP is heading.

**The `get-overview` tool reduces round trips.** One call gives agents a dashboard-style summary of your Todoist state — upcoming tasks, active projects, inbox items. Without this, an agent would need to call `find-tasks`, `find-projects`, and `find-sections` separately to understand context. Small optimization, meaningful token savings.

**Delete operations exist.** Unlike Linear's MCP server (which has no delete or archive), Todoist includes `delete-object` for removing tasks, projects, and other entities. Full CRUD coverage is what you'd expect from a task manager, and Todoist delivers it.

**Official and actively maintained.** 382 stars, MIT license, automated releases via release-please, ~1,425 weekly npm downloads. This isn't abandonware — Doist is actively developing it. The deprecation of the older `Doist/todoist-mcp` repo in favor of the broader `todoist-ai` SDK shows strategic investment.

## What's Not

**Critical bugs in core tools.** As of this review, `add-sections` is "completely non-functional" (GitHub issue #333, p1) and `manage-assignments` "silently fails to assign tasks" (#330, p1). Two p1 bugs in core CRUD tools is concerning for a production server. The project self-describes as "early stages," and it shows.

**Batch operations can time out.** Creating multiple tasks in a single call can fail with timeouts (#337). For agents that want to create a structured project with dozens of tasks at once, this is a workflow-breaking limitation.

**Project management is incomplete.** `add-projects` doesn't support workspace or folder placement (#332). `searchProjects` misses projects with a `parentId` (#358). Project responses are missing `folder_id`, `parent_id`, and `child_order` fields (#329). The project hierarchy features are half-implemented — you can create projects but can't reliably organize them.

**No reordering.** You can't reorder tasks within sections (#280) or projects within workspaces. For agents helping users organize their task lists, this is a gap. Todoist's power users rely heavily on manual ordering, and the MCP server can't replicate that.

**No reminders or attachments.** The `add-tasks` and `update-tasks` tools don't support reminders (#92). Agents can't read task attachments (#327). These are Todoist features that users depend on but the MCP server doesn't expose.

**Self-described "early stages."** Doist is transparent about this, which is honest. But it means the tool surface is still stabilizing. Tools may change names, parameters may shift, and existing integrations may break across updates.

## Community & Alternatives

The Todoist MCP ecosystem is fragmented, with at least six community servers predating the official one:

- **abhiz123/todoist-mcp-server** — The most referenced community server. Node.js, stdio, natural language task management. Simpler but more stable for basic CRUD.
- **greirson/mcp-todoist** — Connects Claude to Todoist with bulk operation support. Good for batch task creation if the official server's timeouts are a problem.
- **stanislavlysenko0912/todoist-mcp-server** — Full REST API v2 and Sync API implementation. The most complete community alternative in terms of API coverage.
- **mikemc/todoist-mcp-server** — Python implementation using the Todoist Python API.
- **IAMSamuelRodda/todoist-mcp** — FastMCP-based, Python.
- **Hint-Services/mcp-todoist** — Covers tasks, projects, sections, and labels.

The official server doesn't fully replace these yet — its critical bugs in sections and assignments mean community servers may be more reliable for those specific operations today. But the trajectory is clear: the official server has more tools, better authentication, and the backing of Doist's engineering team.

## How It Compares

| Feature | Todoist | Linear | Notion | Slack |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Official server** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Transport** | HTTP + SSE + stdio | Streamable HTTP | HTTP + stdio | HTTP |
| **Auth** | OAuth | OAuth 2.1 | OAuth / API key | OAuth |
| **Tool count** | 28+ | 23+ | 18 | 8 |
| **Delete support** | Yes | No | Yes | N/A |
| **MCP Apps (widgets)** | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Local option** | Yes (stdio) | No | Yes (stdio) | No |
| **Critical bugs** | Yes (2 p1) | No | No | No |
| **Maturity** | Early | Stable | Stable | Stable |

**vs. Linear:** Linear has better tool design (flat parameters, embedded enums, "me" shortcuts) and is more stable. Todoist has more transport options, delete support, and MCP Apps. Linear is a project management platform; Todoist is a personal/team task manager. Different use cases, but Linear's MCP is more polished.

**vs. Notion:** Notion covers knowledge management alongside tasks. Todoist is laser-focused on task management with a wider tool surface for that specific domain. Notion's MCP is more stable but had its own growing pains (the v2.0.0 breaking rename). Both support local and hosted deployment.

**vs. community Todoist servers:** The official server wins on tool count, authentication (OAuth vs API keys), transport flexibility, and MCP Apps. The community servers win on stability — no critical bugs in core operations. For today, the official server is the right choice if you can work around the section and assignment bugs.

## Who's It For

The Todoist MCP server works best for **individual users and small teams already on Todoist** who want to manage tasks conversationally. "Add a task to submit the report by Friday #Work p1" through Claude is genuinely faster than opening the Todoist app.

For **developers building AI agents** that need task management, the SDK-first architecture is the real selling point. Import the tools directly into your Vercel AI SDK project or custom pipeline — you're not locked into the MCP protocol.

For **teams evaluating task management MCP servers**, Todoist's transport flexibility (HTTP + SSE + stdio) and MCP Apps set it apart architecturally. But the critical bugs in sections and assignments mean you should test your specific workflows before committing.

For **heavy Todoist users** who rely on reminders, attachments, task reordering, or complex project hierarchies — the MCP server doesn't cover your full workflow yet. You'll still need the Todoist app for those operations.

## The Bottom Line

Todoist's MCP server is a **4/5**. The SDK-first architecture, three transport protocols, OAuth authentication, MCP Apps support, and 28+ tools represent the most ambitious productivity MCP server we've seen in terms of scope. The `get-overview` tool and delete support show design thinking that's absent from competitors.

But two p1 bugs in core tools (`add-sections` broken, `manage-assignments` failing silently), incomplete project hierarchy support, and the self-described "early stages" status mean you'll hit rough edges. The tool surface is wide but not yet deep — batch timeouts, missing reminders, and no reordering limit real-world workflows.

The trajectory is promising. Doist is actively investing in this as part of their broader AI strategy, not just shipping a minimal MCP checkbox. If the critical bugs get fixed and the project management gaps close, this could be the reference implementation for productivity MCP servers. Today, it's a strong foundation with some holes.

**Rating: 4/5** — Most ambitious productivity MCP server with SDK-first architecture and MCP Apps, but critical bugs in core tools and incomplete project features keep it from its potential.
