**At a glance:** 393 GitHub stars, 37 forks, v8.4.0, ~33.5K all-time PulseMCP visitors (#689 globally, ~700 weekly), 37+ tools across 9 categories, 22 contributors, MIT license

The Todoist MCP server is Doist's official bridge between AI assistants and their task management platform. It's part of a broader `todoist-ai` SDK — the tools aren't just for MCP but can be imported directly into custom AI applications. The MCP server is one distribution surface for a reusable tool library.

The server provides 37+ tools covering the full task lifecycle: creating and finding tasks, managing projects and sections, commenting, handling assignments, tracking activity, managing filters, viewing attachments, analyzing productivity, and searching across your entire Todoist workspace. A hosted endpoint at `ai.todoist.net/mcp` means zero local installation for most users.

What sets this apart from community Todoist MCP servers: it's the official implementation, actively developed, with MCP Apps support for rendering interactive task widgets directly in chat interfaces.

The key question: does the official server deliver enough to replace the half-dozen community alternatives?

## What's New (March 2026 Update)

The pace of development since our initial review has been remarkable — **20+ releases from v7.4.0 to v8.4.0** between January 20 and March 19. Key changes:

**Critical bug fixes:**
- **`manage-assignments` now works** (#330, closed). The silent failure that prevented task assignment persistence is resolved as of v7.11.0. Assignments persist correctly across shared projects.
- **Batch task creation no longer times out** (#337, closed). v8.0.1 parallelized task creation with `Promise.allSettled()`, added a 25-task-per-call limit, and introduced partial failure handling — successes return even if some tasks fail. The 30-second timeout wall is gone.
- **`add-sections` partially fixed** (#333, still open). Investigation revealed the HTTP 500 error is client-specific: the tool works in local MCP, Claude Code, and ChatGPT, but fails in Claude Web. One user confirmed sections are actually created despite the error message — it's faulty error reporting, not broken functionality. Labeled p1 with Anthropic involvement.

**New tools added:**
- **`view-attachment`** (v8.4.0) — agents can now read task attachments, closing a previous gap.
- **`get-productivity-stats`** (v8.3.0) — AI-driven productivity analysis with a dedicated prompt.
- **`reorder-objects`** (v8.2.0) — reorder projects and sections, a highly requested feature that was completely missing before.
- **Filter management** (v8.1.0) — four new tools: `find-filters`, `add-filters`, `update-filters`, `delete-filters`. Todoist power users live by filters; now agents can manage them.
- **`reschedule-tasks`** (v7.17.0) — reschedule tasks while preserving recurring patterns. Previously, rescheduling a recurring task could break the recurrence rule.

**Project management improvements:**
- `folderId` and `childOrder` now included in project responses (v7.15.0), fixing #329.
- Workspace support added to `add-projects` (v7.14.0), partially addressing #332.
- Wildcard queries for substring matching (v7.15.0).
- `filterIdOrName` parameter for `find-tasks` (v7.16.0).

**Infrastructure changes:**
- **Breaking: v8.0.0** renamed the `search` parameter to `searchText` for consistency. Existing integrations using the old parameter name need updating.
- Task ordering parameter added (v7.4.0) — tasks can now be positioned within lists.
- ToolAnnotations hints for MCP support (v7.6.0).
- Stateless HTTP mode (v7.10.0).

**Todoist platform news:**
- **Todoist Ramble** launched January 21 — voice-to-task AI powered by Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Live, supporting 38 languages. Free users get 10 sessions/month; Pro and Business get unlimited. This signals Doist's broader AI investment beyond the MCP server.

## What It Does

The Todoist MCP server exposes tools across nine functional categories:

**Task management (8 tools):**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `add-tasks` | Create new tasks with titles, descriptions, due dates, priorities, labels (parallelized, max 25/call) |
| `find-tasks` | Search tasks with filtering, now supports `filterIdOrName` |
| `find-tasks-by-date` | Locate tasks within specific timeframes |
| `find-completed-tasks` | Retrieve finished tasks |
| `complete-tasks` | Mark tasks as done |
| `uncomplete-tasks` | Reopen completed tasks |
| `update-tasks` | Modify task properties with explicit due/deadline clearing |
| `reschedule-tasks` | Reschedule while preserving recurrence patterns |

**Project management (6 tools):**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `add-projects` | Create new projects (now with workspace support) |
| `find-projects` | Search projects |
| `update-projects` | Edit project details (typed colors) |
| `project-management` | Archive/unarchive operations |
| `project-move` | Transfer projects between personal/workspace |
| `reorder-objects` | Reorder projects and sections within hierarchy |

**Sections (3 tools):**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `add-sections` | Create project sections (see known issues) |
| `find-sections` | Search sections |
| `update-sections` | Modify section details |

**Comments & collaboration (5 tools):**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `add-comments` | Add comments to tasks or projects |
| `find-comments` | Search comments |
| `update-comments` | Edit existing comments |
| `manage-assignments` | Handle task assignments in shared projects (fixed) |
| `find-project-collaborators` | List project members |

**Labels & organization (2 tools):**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `add-labels` | Create labels |
| `find-labels` | Search labels |

**Filters (4 tools):**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `find-filters` | Search saved filters |
| `add-filters` | Create new filters |
| `update-filters` | Modify filter definitions |
| `delete-filters` | Remove filters |

**Information & search (5 tools):**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `user-info` | Retrieve account details |
| `list-workspaces` | Display available workspaces |
| `get-overview` | Dashboard summary of current state |
| `find-activity` | Activity tracking and history |
| `get-productivity-stats` | AI-driven productivity analysis |

**Data operations (4 tools):**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search` | General search (OpenAI MCP spec compliant, param renamed to `searchText` in v8.0.0) |
| `fetch` / `fetch-object` | Retrieve specific data objects |
| `delete-object` | Delete tasks, projects, or other objects |
| `view-attachment` | View task attachments |

The `get-overview` tool is a nice design choice — it gives agents a quick snapshot of your Todoist state without requiring multiple calls to list tasks, projects, and sections separately.

## Setup

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http todoist https://ai.todoist.net/mcp
```

Launch Claude, run `/mcp`, select the todoist server, and authenticate via browser.

**Claude Desktop / claude.ai:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "todoist": {
      "url": "https://ai.todoist.net/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Cursor / VS Code (via mcp-remote):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "todoist": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://ai.todoist.net/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Local stdio (for development or custom setups):**

```bash
npx @doist/todoist-ai
```

The hosted endpoint is the recommended path. First connection triggers a browser-based OAuth wizard — authorize with your Todoist account and you're connected. No API keys to manage locally.

## Authentication

OAuth 2.0 via browser-based authorization flow. The hosted server at `ai.todoist.net/mcp` handles the OAuth dance — you authenticate in your browser, and your MCP client stores tokens locally. No API keys stored on disk.

For local development or direct SDK usage, you can use a `TODOIST_API_KEY` environment variable with a personal API token (Settings > Integrations > Developer in Todoist).

The transport protocol support is comprehensive:
- **Streamable HTTP** at `https://ai.todoist.net/mcp` — the primary hosted endpoint
- **SSE** (Server-Sent Events) — supported for clients that need it
- **stdio** — local process execution via `npx @doist/todoist-ai`

All three transports in one server is rare. Among the productivity MCP servers we've reviewed, only Todoist offers this flexibility — Linear and Notion have moved to hosted-only or are deprecating non-HTTP transports.

## What's Good

**The SDK-first architecture is forward-thinking.** Most MCP servers are just MCP servers — tools built specifically for the MCP protocol. Todoist-ai inverts this: it's a reusable tool library that happens to expose an MCP server as one interface. The same tools can be imported into Vercel AI SDK projects, custom agent pipelines, or any TypeScript application. This means the tools get tested and used across more surfaces, which tends to improve quality.

**The development velocity is exceptional.** Twenty-plus releases in two months (January–March 2026), with v7.4.0 to v8.4.0 shipping new tools, bug fixes, and infrastructure improvements at a pace that outstrips most official MCP servers. Doist has a team actively responding to issues — the batch timeout bug was reported on February 28 and fixed by March 17 with a well-engineered solution (parallel execution, partial failure handling, batch limits). 393 stars, 22 contributors, MIT license, automated releases via release-please.

**Three transport protocols covers every client.** Streamable HTTP for hosted deployments, SSE for clients that need it, and stdio for local development. You're not locked into one client ecosystem. Claude Desktop uses HTTP, Cursor uses mcp-remote, Claude Code uses HTTP directly, and you can run it locally for custom agent work — all with the same server.

**MCP Apps bring interactive UI to chat.** Instead of plain text task lists, Todoist can render interactive widgets directly in chat interfaces. This isn't just cosmetic — interactive task lists, checkable items, and visual project overviews are genuinely more useful than text dumps. This is early (supported in limited clients), but it's the direction MCP is heading.

**The `get-overview` tool reduces round trips.** One call gives agents a dashboard-style summary of your Todoist state — upcoming tasks, active projects, inbox items. Without this, an agent would need to call `find-tasks`, `find-projects`, and `find-sections` separately to understand context. Small optimization, meaningful token savings.

**Delete operations exist.** Unlike Linear's MCP server (which has no delete or archive), Todoist includes `delete-object` for removing tasks, projects, and other entities. Full CRUD coverage is what you'd expect from a task manager, and Todoist delivers it.

**Filter management is a power-user differentiator.** Four dedicated tools for creating, searching, updating, and deleting filters. Todoist power users build their workflows around custom filters — "overdue & #Work," "today & p1" — and now agents can manage these programmatically. No other task management MCP server we've reviewed exposes filter management.

## What's Not

**`add-sections` has a client-specific bug.** Issue #333 remains open with p1 priority. The tool returns HTTP 500 errors in Claude Web, though it works in Claude Code, local MCP, and ChatGPT. One user confirmed sections are actually created despite the error — it's faulty error reporting, not missing functionality. Anthropic is involved in the investigation. Workaround: use Claude Code or ChatGPT instead of Claude Web for section creation.

**`add-projects` still doesn't support folder placement.** Issue #332 remains open. While workspace support was added (v7.14.0) and `folderId`/`childOrder` now appear in project responses (v7.15.0), you still can't place a new project directly into a specific folder at creation time. For users with deeply nested project hierarchies, this requires a create-then-move workflow.

**No reminders.** The `add-tasks` and `update-tasks` tools don't support reminders (#92). This is a Todoist feature that many users depend on, but the MCP server doesn't expose it. If your workflow relies on time-based or location-based reminders, you'll still need the Todoist app.

**Attachment viewing is read-only.** The new `view-attachment` tool (v8.4.0) lets agents read task attachments, but there's no tool for adding attachments to tasks. Read-only access is progress, but the write side is still missing.

**Breaking changes in v8.0.0.** The `search` parameter was renamed to `searchText`. This kind of breaking change in a maturing server can disrupt existing agent prompts and tool-calling patterns. The rename is reasonable (consistency), but agents relying on the old parameter name silently break.

**Open issues reduced but not eliminated.** Down from many open issues to roughly 4 open, with most being tracked and assigned. The project has matured significantly but still has rough edges around project hierarchy and client-specific behavior.

## Community & Alternatives

The Todoist MCP ecosystem is fragmented, with at least six community servers predating the official one:

- **abhiz123/todoist-mcp-server** — The most referenced community server. Node.js, stdio, natural language task management. Simpler but stable for basic CRUD.
- **greirson/mcp-todoist** — Connects Claude to Todoist with bulk operation support. Less relevant now that the official server fixed batch timeouts.
- **stanislavlysenko0912/todoist-mcp-server** — Full REST API v2 and Sync API implementation. The most complete community alternative in terms of API coverage.
- **mikemc/todoist-mcp-server** — Python implementation using the Todoist Python API.
- **IAMSamuelRodda/todoist-mcp** — FastMCP-based, Python.
- **Hint-Services/mcp-todoist** — Covers tasks, projects, sections, and labels.

The gap between the official server and community alternatives has widened significantly. With the batch timeout fix, assignment bug fix, filter management, attachment viewing, reordering, and productivity stats, the official server now has substantially more tools (37+ vs. typically 8–15 for community servers) and better reliability. The community servers' stability advantage — their main selling point previously — has largely evaporated as the official server fixed its critical bugs.

## How It Compares

| Feature | Todoist | Linear | Notion | Slack |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Official server** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Transport** | HTTP + SSE + stdio | Streamable HTTP | HTTP + stdio | HTTP |
| **Auth** | OAuth | OAuth 2.1 | OAuth / API key | OAuth |
| **Tool count** | 37+ | 23+ | 18 | 8 |
| **Delete support** | Yes | No | Yes | N/A |
| **MCP Apps (widgets)** | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Local option** | Yes (stdio) | No | Yes (stdio) | No |
| **Filter management** | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Critical bugs** | 1 (client-specific) | No | No | No |
| **Maturity** | Maturing rapidly | Stable | Stable | Stable |

**vs. Linear:** Linear has better tool design (flat parameters, embedded enums, "me" shortcuts) and is more stable. Todoist now has significantly more tools (37+ vs. 23+), more transport options, delete support, filter management, and MCP Apps. Linear is a project management platform; Todoist is a personal/team task manager. Different use cases, and Todoist's MCP has narrowed the polish gap considerably.

**vs. Notion:** Notion covers knowledge management alongside tasks. Todoist is laser-focused on task management with the widest tool surface for that specific domain. Notion's MCP is more stable but had its own growing pains (the v2.0.0 breaking rename). Both support local and hosted deployment.

**vs. community Todoist servers:** The official server now decisively wins on tool count (37+ vs. 8–15), authentication (OAuth vs API keys), transport flexibility, filter management, attachment viewing, reordering, productivity stats, and MCP Apps. The stability gap that previously favored community servers has mostly closed. The official server is the clear choice for new integrations.

## Who's It For

The Todoist MCP server works best for **individual users and small teams already on Todoist** who want to manage tasks conversationally. "Add a task to submit the report by Friday #Work p1" through Claude is genuinely faster than opening the Todoist app.

For **developers building AI agents** that need task management, the SDK-first architecture is the real selling point. Import the tools directly into your Vercel AI SDK project or custom pipeline — you're not locked into the MCP protocol.

For **teams evaluating task management MCP servers**, Todoist's transport flexibility (HTTP + SSE + stdio), MCP Apps, and filter management set it apart architecturally. The remaining client-specific `add-sections` bug is a minor concern — workarounds exist.

For **heavy Todoist users** who rely on reminders, attachment uploads, or complex folder-based project placement — the MCP server covers most of your workflow now (reordering, filters, attachment viewing) but still has gaps in reminders and attachment creation. The trajectory suggests these are a matter of time.

## The Bottom Line

Todoist's MCP server is a **4/5**. The SDK-first architecture, three transport protocols, OAuth authentication, MCP Apps support, and 37+ tools represent the most ambitious and now most complete productivity MCP server we've seen. Filter management, reordering, productivity stats, and attachment viewing fill gaps that made the previous version feel incomplete.

The development velocity tells the real story: 20+ releases in two months, critical bugs fixed promptly, and the open issue count collapsed from a sprawling backlog to roughly four items. The `manage-assignments` and batch timeout bugs that we flagged in our initial review? Both fixed. The missing project hierarchy fields? Added. Reordering? Shipped. This is what active investment looks like.

What remains: `add-sections` has a client-specific reporting bug (works in most clients, errors in Claude Web), `add-projects` still can't target folders directly, and reminders are still unsupported. These are real gaps, but they're the kinds of gaps that get closed at this pace of development.

Doist isn't just maintaining an MCP server — they're building an AI integration platform. The Todoist Ramble voice feature, the SDK-first architecture, the OpenAI MCP spec compliance, and the MCP Apps widgets all point to a company that sees AI as core to their product's future, not a checkbox. For task management through AI, this is the server to use.

**Rating: 4/5** — The most complete productivity MCP server available, with rapid development closing previous gaps. SDK-first architecture, MCP Apps, and 37+ tools set the standard. Minor remaining issues (client-specific section bug, no reminders, no attachment upload) are the only things keeping this from a higher rating.
