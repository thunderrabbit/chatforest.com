card_description: "Apple and macOS MCP servers for AI-powered Mac automation, Siri Shortcuts, HomeKit smart home control, Apple Music, Notes, Reminders, and more. **supermemoryai/apple-mcp is the standout** — 3,000 stars and growing, it's a comprehensive collection of apple-native tools covering Notes, Reminders, Calendar, Contacts, Mail, Messages, Music, and Finder through the Model Context Protocol. It features explicit access permission requests with clear error messages and step-by-step instructions for granting macOS permissions. Complex multi-app workflows are possible — 'Read my conference notes, find contacts for the people I met, and send them a thank you message.' **macOS automation gets a massive knowledge base** — steipete/macos-automator-mcp (709 stars) transforms your AI assistant into a macOS power user with 200+ pre-built AppleScript and JXA (JavaScript for Automation) recipes. From toggling dark mode to extracting URLs from Safari, the knowledge base can be loaded lazily or eagerly at startup. Custom automation recipes can be added. Published on npm as @steipete/macos-automator-mcp. Created by Peter Steinberger, well-known in the Apple developer community. **Siri Shortcuts bridge the MCP-iOS gap** — dvcrn/mcp-server-siri-shortcuts lets AI assistants list, open, and run macOS Shortcuts directly. recursechat/mcp-server-apple-shortcuts provides safe, controlled Shortcuts execution for AI models. CaseyRo/mac_shortcuts_mcp offers a Python-based alternative. Since Shortcuts can control HomeKit, trigger automations, and interact with hundreds of apps, this effectively gives MCP access to the entire Apple Shortcuts ecosystem. **HomeKit gets multiple MCP implementations** — somethingwithproof/home-mcp controls HomeKit devices, scenes, and automations via Apple Home on macOS. jaebinsim/HomeMCP takes a zero-infrastructure approach using iOS Shortcuts and Apple Intelligence — no local LLM or GPU required. omarshahine/HomeClaw is a unified Catalyst app providing HomeKit control for lights, locks, thermostats, and scenes via MCP, compatible with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and OpenClaw. **Apple Music has 4+ MCP server implementations** — kennethreitz/mcp-applemusic (experimental, AppleScript-based — play, pause, search, create playlists, browse library) is the most well-known. samwang0723/mcp-applemusic provides TypeScript implementation with Express.js. epheterson/mcp-applemusic manages playlists via the official Apple Music REST API. pedrocid/music-mcp offers another AppleScript-based control option. **Notes and Reminders have dedicated servers** — karlhepler/apple-mcp provides full CRUD operations for both Apple Notes and Reminders with folder/list management, search, and robust error handling (TypeScript + AppleScript). mggrim/apple-reminders-mcp-server is the most feature-rich Reminders server with 18 tools and natural language date parsing. Multiple other Reminders implementations exist from shadowfax92 and dbmcco. FradSer/mcp-server-apple-events provides native EventKit integration covering both Reminders and Calendar. **iCloud integration exists** — iteratio/icloud-mcp provides a local MCP server for iCloud Calendar, Mail, and Reminders with credentials securely stored in the macOS Keychain. **Screenshots and screen control are well-served** — steipete/Peekaboo captures application or system screenshots with optional visual question answering (VQA) through local or remote AI models — excellent for agentic workflows that need to 'see' the screen. jhead/macos-screen-mcp provides screenshot and window control capabilities. **Safari has its own MCP server** — lxman/safari-mcp-server enables AI-controlled Safari browsing, complementing the more common Playwright/Puppeteer-based browser automation. **Clipboard integration exists** — vlad-ds/maccy-clipboard-mcp connects to Maccy clipboard history with search, retrieval, and management for both text and images. **Raycast gets MCP integration** — ExpertVagabond/raycast-mcp-server provides 9 tools for AI-native macOS workflow automation through the popular Raycast launcher. **Major gaps remain** — no Xcode project management or build automation via MCP. No macOS System Settings/Preferences control. No Time Machine backup management. No AirDrop file transfer. No Keychain password retrieval (understandably — security concerns). No macOS Automator workflow import/conversion. No Focus/Do Not Disturb mode control. No disk utility or storage management. No accessibility feature control. No Terminal.app integration beyond standard shell MCP servers. The category earns 4/5 — Apple and macOS MCP is surprisingly mature thanks to the massive supermemoryai/apple-mcp project (3,000 stars) serving as a comprehensive hub and steipete/macos-automator-mcp (709 stars) providing deep automation knowledge. The key insight is that AppleScript, despite being decades old, acts as a powerful bridge between MCP and virtually every macOS application. Siri Shortcuts extend this further into iOS territory. HomeKit gets multiple implementations. Apple Music has 4+ servers. The ecosystem benefits from macOS's strong automation foundations — AppleScript, JXA, Shortcuts, and Automator all provide hooks that MCP servers can leverage. The main weakness is that these servers are macOS-only by nature, limiting the audience. But for Mac users, this is one of the most practical MCP categories — controlling your actual desktop environment, apps, and smart home through AI."

## What's Missing

Despite strong coverage, significant gaps remain:

- **No Xcode integration** — no project management, build automation, or test running via MCP
- **No System Settings/Preferences control** — can't toggle Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or other system preferences
- **No Time Machine** — no backup management or restore capabilities
- **No AirDrop** — no file transfer between Apple devices
- **No Keychain password retrieval** — understandable given security implications
- **No Focus/Do Not Disturb** — no mode switching
- **No Disk Utility** — no storage management
- **No Terminal.app integration** — beyond standard shell MCP servers
- **No macOS Automator workflow import** — can't convert existing .workflow files

## The Bottom Line

**Rating: 4/5** — Apple and macOS MCP is surprisingly mature, anchored by supermemoryai/apple-mcp (3,000 stars) covering 8+ apps in one package and steipete/macos-automator-mcp (709 stars) providing 200+ automation recipes.

The key insight: **AppleScript, despite being decades old, is the perfect bridge between MCP and macOS applications.** Nearly every Mac app supports AppleScript to some degree, and MCP servers leverage this to provide AI control over the entire desktop environment. Siri Shortcuts extend this further, bridging into iOS and HomeKit.

HomeKit gets three independent implementations. Apple Music has four. Notes and Reminders have multiple dedicated servers. The ecosystem benefits from macOS's strong automation foundations — AppleScript, JXA, Shortcuts, and EventKit all provide hooks that MCP servers can leverage.

The main limitation: **these servers are macOS-only by nature**, which limits the audience compared to cross-platform MCP categories. But for Mac users, this is one of the most practical MCP categories — you're controlling your actual desktop environment, apps, and smart home through AI, not just accessing remote APIs.
