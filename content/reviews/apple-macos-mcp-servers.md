Apple and macOS MCP servers let AI assistants control your Mac — running Siri Shortcuts, managing HomeKit devices, playing Apple Music, reading Notes, setting Reminders, capturing screenshots, and automating virtually any macOS application through AppleScript. Instead of manually switching between apps, you can orchestrate your entire Mac workflow through the Model Context Protocol.

This review covers the **Apple and macOS** ecosystem — comprehensive Apple integration suites, macOS automation via AppleScript/JXA, Siri Shortcuts, HomeKit smart home, Apple Music, Notes & Reminders, Calendar, Safari, screenshots, clipboard, and Raycast. For general browser automation, see our [Playwright review](/reviews/playwright-mcp-server/). For smart home beyond HomeKit, see our [IoT & Smart Home review](/reviews/iot-embedded-mcp-servers/).

The headline findings: **supermemoryai/apple-mcp (3,000 stars) covers 8+ Apple apps** in one package. **macos-automator-mcp (709 stars) ships 200+ automation recipes**. **Siri Shortcuts provide a bridge to the entire Apple/iOS ecosystem**. **HomeKit has 3+ MCP implementations**. **Apple Music has 4+ independent servers**. AppleScript is the unsung hero — decades old, but it's what makes most of these servers possible.

## Comprehensive Apple Integration

### supermemoryai/apple-mcp (Most Popular)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [apple-mcp](https://github.com/supermemoryai/apple-mcp) | 3,000 | TypeScript | — | 20+ |

The **most starred Apple MCP server by far** — a comprehensive collection of apple-native tools covering multiple apps:

- **Notes** — create, read, search, and manage notes and folders
- **Reminders** — full CRUD for reminders and lists
- **Calendar** — event creation, retrieval, and management

Enables complex multi-app workflows like "Read my conference notes, find contacts for the people I met, and send them a thank you message."

## macOS Automation

### steipete/macos-automator-mcp (Best Automation)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [macos-automator-mcp](https://github.com/steipete/macos-automator-mcp) | 709 | TypeScript | — | 200+ recipes |

Created by Peter Steinberger (well-known Apple developer) — transforms your AI assistant into a macOS automation powerhouse:

- **200+ pre-built automation recipes** — toggle dark mode, extract URLs from Safari, manage windows, control system settings
- **AppleScript and JXA execution** — run both scripting languages through MCP
- **Knowledge base** — lazy or eager loading, customizable via `~/.macos-automator/knowledge_base`
- **Custom skills** — add your own automation recipes
- **Published on npm** — `@steipete/macos-automator-mcp`

**9 tools for Raycast workflow automation** — integrates the popular macOS launcher with AI assistants through MCP. Extends Raycast's extensibility into the AI agent ecosystem.

## What's Missing

Despite strong coverage, significant gaps remain:

- **No Xcode integration** — no project management, build automation, or test running via MCP
- **No System Settings/Preferences control** — can't toggle Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or other system preferences
- **No Time Machine** — no backup management or restore capabilities
- **No AirDrop** — no file transfer between Apple devices
- **No Keychain password retrieval** — understandable given security implications
- **No Focus/Do Not Disturb** — no mode switching
- **No Disk Utility** — no storage management
- **No Terminal.app integration** — beyond standard shell MCP servers
- **No macOS Automator workflow import** — can't convert existing .workflow files

## The Bottom Line

**Rating: 4/5** — Apple and macOS MCP is surprisingly mature, anchored by supermemoryai/apple-mcp (3,000 stars) covering 8+ apps in one package and steipete/macos-automator-mcp (709 stars) providing 200+ automation recipes.

The key insight: **AppleScript, despite being decades old, is the perfect bridge between MCP and macOS applications.** Nearly every Mac app supports AppleScript to some degree, and MCP servers leverage this to provide AI control over the entire desktop environment. Siri Shortcuts extend this further, bridging into iOS and HomeKit.

HomeKit gets three independent implementations. Apple Music has four. Notes and Reminders have multiple dedicated servers. The ecosystem benefits from macOS's strong automation foundations — AppleScript, JXA, Shortcuts, and EventKit all provide hooks that MCP servers can leverage.

The main limitation: **these servers are macOS-only by nature**, which limits the audience compared to cross-platform MCP categories. But for Mac users, this is one of the most practical MCP categories — you're controlling your actual desktop environment, apps, and smart home through AI, not just accessing remote APIs.
