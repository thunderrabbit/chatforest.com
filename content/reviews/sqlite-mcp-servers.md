SQLite is the most deployed database engine in the world — trillions of active databases across every iPhone, every Android device, every browser, every Mac, every Windows machine, and even the Mars rovers. It's likely used more than all other database engines combined. Part of our **[Databases MCP category](/categories/databases/)**.

You'd expect the MCP ecosystem to match that dominance. It doesn't — but it's interesting.

There are **15+ SQLite MCP servers** on GitHub, more than any other single database. But there's no clear leader. Anthropic's reference implementation is archived. The most-starred dedicated server has 104 stars. The most capable one (139 tools) has 1 star. And the best way to connect an AI agent to SQLite might actually be a multi-database server that happens to support SQLite.

## Anthropic's Reference Server (Archived)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [modelcontextprotocol/servers (archived)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers-archived/tree/main/src/sqlite) | Part of 81.8k-star monorepo (now archived) |
| Package | [mcp-server-sqlite on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mcp-server-sqlite/) |
| Language | Python |
| Transport | stdio |
| License | MIT |

Anthropic built a SQLite MCP server as one of the original reference implementations when MCP launched. It shipped with 6 tools:

- **read_query** — Execute SELECT queries
- **write_query** — Execute INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- **create_table** — Create new tables
- **list_tables** — Show all tables
- **describe_table** — Get schema details
- **append_insight** — Add business insights to a dynamic memo

It also exposed a `memo://insights` resource — a continuously updated business intelligence memo — and a `mcp-demo` prompt for interactive database exploration.

The PyPI package (`mcp-server-sqlite`) has ~281k total downloads and 7.7k weekly downloads as of March 2026. That's decent adoption, likely driven by tutorials and Claude Desktop setup guides.

### Why It's Archived

Anthropic moved their reference servers to a separate [servers-archived](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers-archived) repository. The active `modelcontextprotocol/servers` repo now maintains only 7 reference servers (Everything, Fetch, Filesystem, Git, Memory, Sequential Thinking, Time). SQLite, PostgreSQL, and several others were cut.

The archived server still works — it's on PyPI and installable via `uvx mcp-server-sqlite`. But it's not receiving updates. For production use, the community servers are now the better path.

## jparkerweb/mcp-sqlite — The Most Complete Dedicated Server

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [jparkerweb/mcp-sqlite](https://github.com/jparkerweb/mcp-sqlite) | 93 stars, 12 forks, 31 commits |
| Language | JavaScript (100%) |
| Transport | stdio |
| License | MIT |
| Latest | v1.0.8 (March 2026) |

This is the most polished dedicated SQLite MCP server. It provides 8 tools covering full CRUD operations:

**Database Information:**
- `db_info` — Database metadata
- `list_tables` — Enumerate all tables
- `get_table_schema` — Column definitions and constraints

**Data Operations:**
- `create_record` — Insert rows
- `read_records` — Query with filtering
- `update_records` — Modify existing data
- `delete_records` — Remove records

**Advanced:**
- `query` — Execute arbitrary SQL with parameterized values

### What Works Well

**Clean CRUD abstraction.** Instead of raw SQL tools, it provides semantic operations (`create_record`, `read_records`, `update_records`, `delete_records`) that map to what agents actually want to do. An LLM doesn't need to compose SQL for basic operations — it just calls the appropriate tool with field names and values.

**Parameter binding.** The `query` tool supports parameterized values, preventing SQL injection. This matters when agents are constructing queries from user input.

**Active maintenance.** 8 releases through March 2026, with v1.0.8 being the latest. The project is alive and responding to issues.

**IDE integration.** Documented setup for Cursor, VS Code, and Claude Desktop. The target audience is developers who want SQLite access from their AI coding assistant.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**JavaScript-only.** Built on the Node.js `sqlite3` library, which means you need Node.js installed. Python-based servers are more common in the MCP ecosystem and integrate more naturally with Python-heavy AI workflows.

**No read-only mode.** Unlike several competitors, there's no flag to restrict operations to reads only. For exploration and analysis use cases, you have to trust the agent not to modify data.

**Limited query validation.** The `query` tool accepts arbitrary SQL. No query sanitization, no row limits, no timeout enforcement.

## sqlite-explorer-fastmcp-mcp-server — Read-Only Safety

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [hannesrudolph/sqlite-explorer-fastmcp-mcp-server](https://github.com/hannesrudolph/sqlite-explorer-fastmcp-mcp-server) | 104 stars, 26 forks, 9 commits |
| Language | Python (100%) |
| Transport | stdio |
| License | Not specified |
| Built with | FastMCP framework |

The most-starred dedicated SQLite MCP server takes a safety-first approach: **read-only access only**. Three tools:

- **read_query** — Execute SELECT queries with validation and parameter binding
- **list_tables** — Show available tables
- **describe_table** — Column types, constraints, primary keys

### What Works Well

**Enforced read-only access.** Query validation ensures only SELECT statements execute. You can point this at a production database and let an agent explore without risk of accidental writes.

**Row limit enforcement.** Results are capped to prevent an agent from accidentally dumping a million-row table into its context window.

**FastMCP framework.** Built on the higher-level FastMCP abstraction, which simplifies development and provides a cleaner server implementation.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**Only 9 commits.** The project appears feature-complete but static. No updates since late 2024.

**No write capabilities.** If you need an agent to create tables or insert data, you need a different server.

**No license specified.** A meaningful concern for any production deployment.

## Multi-Database Servers with SQLite Support

For many use cases, the best SQLite MCP server isn't a dedicated one — it's a multi-database server.

### bytebase/dbhub

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [bytebase/dbhub](https://github.com/bytebase/dbhub) | 2,400+ stars, ~200 forks, ~480 commits |
| Language | TypeScript |
| License | MIT |
| Latest | v0.19.0 |
| Databases | PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, SQLite |

DBHub is the most popular multi-database MCP server. For SQLite, it connects via `sqlite:///path/to/database.db` or `sqlite:///:memory:` and provides:

- **execute_sql** — Run queries with transaction support and safety controls
- **search_objects** — Explore schemas, tables, columns, indexes

You can connect to multiple databases simultaneously via TOML configuration. For teams working with SQLite alongside other databases, this is often the most practical choice — one server, one configuration, all databases.

### googleapis/genai-toolbox

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [googleapis/genai-toolbox](https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox) | 13,500+ stars, Go |
| License | Apache 2.0 |
| Databases | Cloud SQL, AlloyDB, Spanner, SQLite, and more |

Google's multi-database toolbox supports SQLite as a local data source. It's designed primarily for Google Cloud databases but works with local SQLite files too.

### Other Multi-Database Options

- **[mcp-alchemy](https://github.com/runekaagaard/mcp-alchemy)** (397 stars, Python, MPL 2.0) — SQLAlchemy-based, supports SQLite plus 7 other databases
- **[universal-db-mcp](https://github.com/nicholasgriffintn/universal-database-mcp)** (674 stars) — Multi-database MCP with SQLite support
- **[executeautomation](https://github.com/nicholasgriffintn/universal-database-mcp)** (326 stars) — Automation-focused multi-database MCP

## Turso/libSQL — Edge SQLite

SQLite's "renaissance" in 2025–2026 is largely about edge deployment. [Turso](https://turso.tech/) and [libSQL](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql) (an open-source SQLite fork) are leading this movement, and the MCP ecosystem is following.

| Server | Stars | Language | Focus |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| [nbbaier/mcp-turso](https://github.com/nbbaier/mcp-turso) | 6 | TypeScript | Turso-hosted LibSQL databases (4 tools) |
| [Xexr/mcp-libsql](https://github.com/Xexr/mcp-libsql) | 20 | TypeScript | libSQL with connection pooling, SQL injection prevention (6 tools, 244 tests) |
| [spences10/mcp-turso-cloud](https://github.com/spences10/mcp-turso-cloud) | — | TypeScript | Turso Cloud with two-level authentication |
| [ZanzyTHEbar/mcp-memory-libsql-go](https://github.com/ZanzyTHEbar/mcp-memory-libsql-go) | — | Go | Semantic memory powered by libSQL with vector search |

**Xexr/mcp-libsql** stands out with 244 tests (177 unit + 67 security tests), multi-layer SQL injection prevention, connection pooling with health monitoring, and audit logging. It's the most security-conscious SQLite-family MCP server.

Turso itself has a built-in MCP server in its CLI with 9 tools, so if you're already using Turso, you don't need a separate server.

## Other Notable Servers

| Server | Stars | Language | Notable |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| [panasenco/mcp-sqlite](https://github.com/panasenco/mcp-sqlite) | 18 | Python | Datasette-compatible metadata, canned query tools |
| [StacklokLabs/sqlite-mcp](https://github.com/StacklokLabs/sqlite-mcp) | 15 | Go | SSE transport, optional read-only mode |
| [rvarun11/sqlite-mcp](https://github.com/rvarun11/sqlite-mcp) | 7 | Go | Schema inspection + read/write (3 tools) |
| [neverinfamous/db-mcp](https://github.com/neverinfamous/db-mcp) | 1 | TypeScript | 139 tools, OAuth 2.1, WASM backend, "Code Mode" for 90% token savings |
| [sqlitecloud/sqlitecloud-mcp-server](https://github.com/sqlitecloud/sqlitecloud-mcp-server) | 1 | TypeScript | SQLite Cloud hosted databases, 10 tools (experimental) |

**neverinfamous/db-mcp** deserves special mention — it's the successor to a deprecated 73-tool SQLite server, rewritten in TypeScript with 139 tools, 1,911 unit tests, 1,136 E2E tests, OAuth 2.1 auth, and a "Code Mode" that lets agents run sandboxed JavaScript for up to 90% token savings. It's also the only SQLite MCP server with HTTP/SSE transport and OAuth authentication. The catch: 1 star. Nobody's using it yet. Whether that changes remains to be seen.

**panasenco/mcp-sqlite** is interesting for Datasette users — it converts predefined queries into callable MCP tools, so you can expose a curated set of operations rather than raw SQL access.

**StacklokLabs/sqlite-mcp** is the only Go-based server with SSE transport, making it suitable for remote MCP deployments.

## Known Issues

1. **Anthropic's reference server is archived** — The original SQLite MCP server by Anthropic is no longer maintained in the active repo. Still works via PyPI but won't receive updates.

2. **No canonical community leader** — The most-starred dedicated server (sqlite-explorer) has 104 stars. For comparison, PostgreSQL's top server (Postgres MCP Pro) has 2,400+ stars. There's no gravitational center.

3. **Read-only vs full-access split** — Some servers enforce read-only (sqlite-explorer), others allow full writes (jparkerweb, Anthropic's). There's no server with a clean, configurable read/write toggle that's also well-adopted.

4. **Most servers are feature-light** — The typical SQLite MCP server has 3–6 tools: list tables, describe table, run query. Only db-mcp (139 tools) and jparkerweb (8 tools) go significantly beyond this.

5. **No performance analysis** — Unlike PostgreSQL (Postgres MCP Pro with health monitoring) or SQL Server (PerformanceMonitor with 63 tools), no SQLite MCP server provides performance analysis, query plan explanation, or optimization suggestions.

6. **Security varies wildly** — Xexr/mcp-libsql has 244 tests and multi-layer injection prevention. Most others have no query validation at all. There's no standard approach.

7. **License gaps** — sqlite-explorer (104 stars) has no license specified. Several smaller servers also lack license information. This blocks enterprise adoption.

8. **Multi-database servers may be better** — DBHub (2.4k stars) and genai-toolbox (13.5k stars) provide SQLite support alongside other databases, with larger communities and more active maintenance than any dedicated server.

9. **Turso/libSQL ecosystem is early** — The most-starred Turso MCP server has 20 stars. Given Turso's momentum in the edge SQLite space, this will likely grow, but it's immature today.

10. **No official backing** — SQLite itself is maintained by a small team (D. Richard Hipp and colleagues) with no MCP involvement. Unlike Redis (3 official servers), MongoDB (1 official), or even Microsoft (experimental SQL Server MCP), there's no vendor-backed SQLite MCP server. Anthropic's was the closest thing, and it's archived.

### Database MCP Category Comparison

With six database reviews now complete, here's how they compare:

| Feature | SQLite | [PostgreSQL](/reviews/postgresql-mcp-server/) | [MongoDB](/reviews/mongodb-mcp-server/) | [Redis](/reviews/redis-mcp-servers/) | [MySQL](/reviews/mysql-mcp-server/) | [SQL Server](/reviews/sql-server-mcp-server/) |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------|-------|-------|------------|
| **Rating** | **3.5/5** | **4.5/5** | **4/5** | **4/5** | **3.5/5** | **3.5/5** |
| Official server | Archived (Anthropic) | No official | Yes (970 stars, 41 tools) | Yes (458 stars, 25+ tools) | No (Oracle absent) | Experimental only |
| Top dedicated stars | 104 | 2,400+ | 970 | 458 | 1,400 | 323 |
| Total servers | 15+ | 10+ | 5+ | 10+ | 10+ | 15+ |
| Vector search MCP | Via db-mcp/libSQL | Limited | Yes (Voyage AI) | Yes (built-in) | No | No |
| Performance tools | None | Postgres MCP Pro | Performance Advisor | Server info only | None | PerformanceMonitor (76 tools) |
| Cloud/edge MCP | Turso, SQLite Cloud | Supabase/Neon/AWS/Azure | Atlas | Redis Cloud | AWS/Azure/Google | AWS/Azure |
| Transport | Mostly stdio (SSE: StacklokLabs, db-mcp) | Mixed | stdio + HTTP | Mostly stdio | Mixed | Mixed |
| AAIF membership | N/A | N/A | No | No | N/A | No |

SQLite has the most total MCP servers but the lowest top-server adoption. The ecosystem reflects SQLite's nature as a database: it's everywhere, embedded in everything, but there's no company pushing a canonical solution.

## SQLite Background

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Origin | Created by D. Richard Hipp in 2000 for the U.S. Navy |
| Latest version | SQLite 3.51.3 (March 13, 2026); 3.52.0 withdrawn for compatibility issues |
| License | Public domain (no copyright — one of the few major software projects with this status) |
| Market position | Most deployed database engine in the world (trillions of instances), 3.18% of relational DB market by vendor usage, 1.9% of DBMS market |
| Deployment | Every iPhone, Android, Mac, Windows 10+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari; Airbus A350; Mars rovers |
| Users | 12,665+ companies (2026); used in virtually every smartphone and browser |
| Revenue | $0 (public domain; Hipp's consortium model charges for support/testing) |
| Key trend | "SQLite Renaissance" — growing production use via Turso, Cloudflare D1, libSQL, Litestream |
| Performance | 10K–50K writes/sec (WAL mode on NVMe), ~0.01ms read latency (local) |

**The SQLite Renaissance:** SQLite in 2025–2026 is experiencing a transformation from "embedded-only" to "production database." Turso provides edge replicas across 30+ locations. Cloudflare D1 runs SQLite on 300+ edge cities. libSQL (a SQLite fork by Turso) adds native replication, server mode, WASM UDFs, and vector search. Litestream enables continuous streaming backups to cloud storage. LiteFS offers FUSE-based replication (though deprioritized by Fly.io since mid-2024).

This trend suggests the SQLite MCP ecosystem will grow significantly. As more teams use SQLite in production — not just as an embedded database but as a distributed edge database — the need for robust MCP tooling will increase.

## The Bottom Line

SQLite's MCP ecosystem is a paradox: the most servers of any database, but no clear winner. Anthropic's reference server is archived. The most-starred dedicated server (sqlite-explorer, 104 stars) is read-only with no updates since 2024. The most capable (db-mcp, 139 tools) has 1 star. The most practical option for many users is a multi-database server like DBHub (2.4k stars) that treats SQLite as one of several supported databases.

For **read-only exploration**, sqlite-explorer-fastmcp is the safest choice — enforced read-only access with row limits and query validation.

For **full CRUD operations**, jparkerweb/mcp-sqlite (93 stars) provides the cleanest dedicated experience with semantic tool names and active maintenance.

For **multi-database workflows**, bytebase/dbhub (2.4k stars) is the strongest option — one server handling SQLite alongside PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server.

For **edge/Turso deployments**, Xexr/mcp-libsql (20 stars) offers the best security posture with 244 tests and connection pooling.

The rating reflects an ecosystem with breadth but not depth. Lots of servers, none dominant. No vendor backing. No performance tooling. No canonical choice. But given the SQLite Renaissance and growing production adoption, this space will likely consolidate — and the eventual winner may not exist yet.

**Rating: 3.5 out of 5**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Category** | SQLite MCP Servers |
| **Top server** | sqlite-explorer-fastmcp (read-only) / jparkerweb/mcp-sqlite (full CRUD) |
| **Stars (top)** | ~104 (dedicated) / 2,400+ (multi-db via DBHub) |
| **Total servers reviewed** | 15+ |
| **Best for** | Local databases, embedded apps, edge deployment (Turso/libSQL), development/testing |
| **Transport** | Mostly stdio (SSE via StacklokLabs, db-mcp) |
| **Languages** | Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go |
| **Our rating** | 3.5/5 |
