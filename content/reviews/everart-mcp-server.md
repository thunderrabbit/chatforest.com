The EverArt MCP server is the official reference integration between EverArt's image generation API and the Model Context Protocol. It lets AI agents generate images from text prompts using five models spanning photorealistic, artistic, and vector styles — all through a single `generate_image` tool.

It was built as part of Anthropic's reference MCP server collection at [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers), but has since been moved to the [servers-archived](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers-archived/tree/main/src/everart) repository. The codebase is read-only as of May 2025. The npm package `everart` gets about 231 weekly downloads — making it one of the least-used servers in the reference collection.

This is our first review of an image generation MCP server. It opens a category we've been watching: creative tools for AI agents. The promise is compelling — agents that can generate visuals as part of their workflows, not just text. The execution here doesn't match the promise.

## What It Does

The server exposes a single tool:

**`generate_image`** — Creates images using EverArt's API from a text prompt. Returns a URL to the generated image and opens it in the default browser.

Parameters:
- `prompt` (required) — Text description of the image to generate
- `model` (optional) — Model identifier. Defaults to `207910310772879360`
- `image_count` (optional) — Number of images to generate. Defaults to 1

### Available Models

| Model ID | Name | Style |
|----------|------|-------|
| 5000 | FLUX1.1 | Standard quality, general-purpose |
| 9000 | FLUX1.1-ultra | Ultra high quality, detailed |
| 6000 | SD3.5 | Stable Diffusion 3.5, diverse styles |
| 7000 | Recraft-Real | Photorealistic |
| 8000 | Recraft-Vector | Vector art (logos, icons, scalable graphics) |

All images generate at 1024x1024 resolution. No other sizes are available through this server.

That's it. One tool, five model options, fixed resolution. The entire implementation fits in a single `index.ts` file.

## Setup

You need an EverArt API key, which requires an EverArt account. EverArt's plans start at $15/month — there is no free tier.

### Via npx

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "everart": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@anthropic/everart-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "EVERART_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Via Docker

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "everart": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-e", "EVERART_API_KEY", "mcp/everart"],
      "env": {
        "EVERART_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Setup is straightforward once you have the API key. The barrier is the API key itself — you need a paid EverArt account before you can generate a single image.

## What Works

**Model variety.** Five models covering different styles means agents can choose the right tool for the job — photorealistic for product mockups, vector for logos and icons, FLUX-ultra for high-detail work. The Recraft-Vector model outputting actual vector art (SVG-compatible) is genuinely useful for web-oriented workflows.

**Simplicity.** One tool, three parameters. There's nothing to misconfigure. An agent can generate an image with just a prompt string. For a reference implementation demonstrating how image generation *could* work over MCP, the minimal surface area makes sense.

**It works.** When configured correctly with a valid API key, the server does generate images. The FLUX and Recraft models produce reasonable quality output. It delivers on its narrow promise.

## What Doesn't Work

**Archived and abandoned.** The codebase has been moved to `servers-archived` and is read-only since May 2025. No bug fixes, no feature additions, no updates to newer EverArt API capabilities. With 231 weekly npm downloads, the community has largely moved on.

**Paid API with no free tier.** EverArt requires a $15/month subscription minimum. Every other MCP server in the reference collection works with free APIs or free tiers — Brave Search has 2,000 free queries/month, Exa offers 1,000 free requests/month, even the PostgreSQL server just needs a database you already have. EverArt is the only reference server that requires a paid subscription to function at all.

**Fixed 1024x1024 resolution.** No control over image dimensions. Need a banner image? A thumbnail? A social media graphic? You get 1024x1024 or nothing. The EverArt API likely supports other sizes, but the MCP server doesn't expose them.

**No image editing or variation.** Modern image generation APIs support inpainting, outpainting, style transfer, image-to-image generation, and variations. This server supports none of that — it's text-to-image only. GPT Image 1.5, the current industry leader, treats editing as a core capability alongside generation.

**Browser-opening side effect.** The server automatically opens generated images in the default browser. This is a UI decision baked into a server that should be headless. In automated agent workflows — CI/CD, batch processing, background tasks — popping open browser tabs is actively disruptive. The URL is returned in the response, which is all the server should do.

**No image storage or management.** Generated images exist only as URLs pointing to EverArt's servers. There's no local download, no file management, no way to reference previous generations. The community fork [everart-forge-mcp](https://github.com/nickbaumann98/everart-forge-mcp) exists specifically to address this gap, adding local storage, format conversion, and image listing.

**Single tool limits agent reasoning.** One tool that does one thing gives agents no room to optimize. There's no "list available models" tool, no "check generation status" tool, no "get image details" tool. Compare this to the Exa MCP server (9 tools) or Sentry MCP server (~20 tools) — more tools give agents more ways to solve problems.

## Who Should Use This

**Almost nobody, in its current state.** The archived status, paid-only API, and minimal functionality make this hard to recommend. If you're already paying for EverArt and want the simplest possible MCP integration, it works. But there are better options for every use case.

## Who Shouldn't

**Anyone who wants production image generation.** The lack of size control, editing capabilities, and local storage makes this unsuitable for real workflows. Use a multi-provider MCP server instead.

**Anyone exploring image generation for the first time.** The $15/month minimum before you can generate a single image is a poor starting experience. OpenAI's GPT Image 1.5, accessible through community MCP servers, offers pay-per-image pricing that starts at zero.

## Alternatives

**[merlinrabens/image-gen-mcp-server](https://github.com/merlinrabens/image-gen-mcp-server)** — Multi-provider MCP server supporting OpenAI DALL-E/GPT Image, Stability AI, and Google Gemini. Multiple providers with automatic fallback means you're not locked into one API. Better model coverage, better resilience.

**[spartanz51/imagegen-mcp](https://github.com/spartanz51/imagegen-mcp)** — OpenAI-focused MCP server for image generation and editing. Supports text-to-image and image-to-image with masking — the editing capabilities EverArt lacks. If you have an OpenAI API key, this is more capable.

**[nickbaumann98/everart-forge-mcp](https://github.com/nickbaumann98/everart-forge-mcp)** — Community fork that addresses EverArt's biggest gaps: local file storage, SVG optimization, format conversion, image listing, and image viewing. If you're committed to EverArt's API, use this instead. 10 stars, last updated February 2025.

**FAL.ai MCP servers** — FAL aggregates 600+ image generation models (FLUX, Recraft, Stable Diffusion, and more) through a single API. Faster inference than most providers (custom CUDA kernels), competitive pricing, and broader model access. The [fal-ai-image-generation MCP server](https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers/sshtunnelvision-fal-ai-image-generation) wraps this for agent use.

**[sammyl720/dall-e-image-generator](https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers/sammyl720-dall-e-image-generator)** — DALL-E/GPT Image MCP server. OpenAI's image generation is the current industry benchmark for prompt understanding and text rendering. Pay-per-image pricing avoids the subscription commitment.

## The Verdict

{{< verdict rating="2.5" summary="A minimal reference implementation that demonstrates image generation over MCP, but the archived codebase, paid-only API, fixed resolution, and single tool make it hard to recommend when multi-provider alternatives exist." >}}

The EverArt MCP server earns a 2.5/5 because it occupies an awkward middle ground: too minimal to be useful in production, too expensive to be a good learning tool. One tool with no editing, no size control, no local storage, and a $15/month minimum entry fee — in a market where community MCP servers offer multi-provider support, image editing, and pay-per-image pricing.

The concept is sound. Agents that can generate images are more capable than agents that can only produce text. The MCP ecosystem needs good image generation servers. But this isn't one of them — it's a reference implementation that served its purpose as a proof of concept and was rightly archived when the ecosystem outgrew it.

The model variety (FLUX, SD3.5, Recraft) is the one genuine strength — particularly Recraft-Vector for SVG output, which most image generation APIs don't offer through MCP. If EverArt's specific models are what you need, the community fork [everart-forge-mcp](https://github.com/nickbaumann98/everart-forge-mcp) is a strictly better implementation.

For everyone else: look at multi-provider image generation MCP servers that give you access to GPT Image 1.5, FLUX, Stable Diffusion, and more through a single integration. The image generation MCP space has matured past single-vendor wrappers.
