The EverArt MCP server is the official reference integration between EverArt's image generation API and the Model Context Protocol. It lets AI agents generate images from text prompts using five models spanning photorealistic, artistic, and vector styles — all through a single `generate_image` tool.

It was built as part of Anthropic's reference MCP server collection at [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers), but has since been moved to the [servers-archived](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers-archived/tree/main/src/everart) repository. The codebase is read-only as of May 2025. The npm package `@modelcontextprotocol/server-everart` gets about 83 weekly downloads — down 64% from the ~231 we reported in our original review, making it one of the least-used servers in the reference collection and still declining.

**At a glance:** v0.6.2 (last published ~9 months ago), archived since May 2025, 83 weekly npm downloads (↓64%), 18.6K PulseMCP all-time visitors (#1,125 globally, 143 weekly), 1 tool, 5 models, $50/month minimum API cost

This is our first review of an image generation MCP server. It opens a category we've been watching: creative tools for AI agents. The promise is compelling — agents that can generate visuals as part of their workflows, not just text. The execution here doesn't match the promise — and the gap has widened since our original review.

## What's New (March 2026 Update)

Since our original review on March 14, the landscape around EverArt's MCP server has shifted significantly — all in ways that make this server harder to recommend.

**EverArt pricing tripled.** The entry-level plan is now $50/month (Plus, 6,000 credits), up from $15/month when we first reviewed. The Pro plan costs $299/month for 30,000 credits. For context, that's $50/month minimum to use a single-tool, archived MCP server that generates 1024x1024 images with no editing capabilities. The pricing page no longer lists a $15 tier.

**Downloads are declining.** Weekly npm downloads have dropped from ~231 to ~83 — a 64% decline. For context, even the archived PostgreSQL MCP server still pulls more downloads. The community is actively moving away.

**Recraft launched an official MCP server.** This is the biggest competitive development. [Recraft's official MCP server](https://github.com/recraft-ai/mcp-recraft-server) offers 16 tools covering text-to-image, image-to-image, inpainting, background replacement, background removal, region erasing, vectorization (SVG), upscaling (crisp and creative), and custom style management. Compare that to EverArt's single `generate_image` tool. The Recraft-Vector and Recraft-Real models that are the strongest part of EverArt's offering? They're available natively through Recraft's own MCP server, with far more capabilities.

**FLUX 2 and GPT Image 1.5 are the new standards.** The image generation landscape has shifted dramatically. FLUX 2 by Black Forest Labs leads photorealism. GPT Image 1.5 leads prompt understanding. Recraft V4 leads vector and logo generation (ranked #1 on HuggingFace benchmarks). EverArt's FLUX1.1 and SD3.5 models are now a generation behind.

**The MCP server remains frozen.** No changes since archival in May 2025. Package v0.6.2, last published approximately nine months ago. No new models, no API updates, no bug fixes.

**PulseMCP traffic is minimal.** 18.6K all-time visitors (#1,125 globally), with only 143 weekly visitors (#3,015 weekly). For comparison, Context7 has 10.1 million all-time visitors.

## What It Does

The server exposes a single tool:

**`generate_image`** — Creates images using EverArt's API from a text prompt. Returns a URL to the generated image and opens it in the default browser.

Parameters:
- `prompt` (required) — Text description of the image to generate
- `model` (optional) — Model identifier. Defaults to `207910310772879360`
- `image_count` (optional) — Number of images to generate. Defaults to 1

### Available Models

| Model ID | Name | Style |
|----------|------|-------|
| 5000 | FLUX1.1 | Standard quality, general-purpose |
| 9000 | FLUX1.1-ultra | Ultra high quality, detailed |
| 6000 | SD3.5 | Stable Diffusion 3.5, diverse styles |
| 7000 | Recraft-Real | Photorealistic |
| 8000 | Recraft-Vector | Vector art (logos, icons, scalable graphics) |

All images generate at 1024x1024 resolution. No other sizes are available through this server.

That's it. One tool, five model options, fixed resolution. The entire implementation fits in a single `index.ts` file.

## Setup

You need an EverArt API key, which requires an EverArt account. EverArt's plans start at $15/month — there is no free tier.

### Via npx

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "everart": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@anthropic/everart-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "EVERART_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Via Docker

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "everart": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-e", "EVERART_API_KEY", "mcp/everart"],
      "env": {
        "EVERART_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Setup is straightforward once you have the API key. The barrier is the API key itself — you need a paid EverArt account before you can generate a single image.

## What Works

**Model variety.** Five models covering different styles means agents can choose the right tool for the job — photorealistic for product mockups, vector for logos and icons, FLUX-ultra for high-detail work. The Recraft-Vector model outputting actual vector art (SVG-compatible) is genuinely useful for web-oriented workflows.

**Simplicity.** One tool, three parameters. There's nothing to misconfigure. An agent can generate an image with just a prompt string. For a reference implementation demonstrating how image generation *could* work over MCP, the minimal surface area makes sense.

**It works.** When configured correctly with a valid API key, the server does generate images. The FLUX and Recraft models produce reasonable quality output. It delivers on its narrow promise.

## What Doesn't Work

**Archived and abandoned.** The codebase has been moved to `servers-archived` and is read-only since May 2025. No bug fixes, no feature additions, no updates to newer EverArt API capabilities. With 231 weekly npm downloads, the community has largely moved on.

**Paid API with no free tier — and the price tripled.** EverArt now requires a $50/month subscription minimum (Plus plan, 6,000 credits), up from $15/month when this server was built. The Pro plan is $299/month. Every other MCP server in the reference collection works with free APIs or free tiers — Brave Search has 2,000 free queries/month, Exa offers 1,000 free requests/month, even the PostgreSQL server just needs a database you already have. EverArt is the only reference server that requires a paid subscription to function at all, and that subscription now costs 3x what it did when the server was relevant.

**Fixed 1024x1024 resolution.** No control over image dimensions. Need a banner image? A thumbnail? A social media graphic? You get 1024x1024 or nothing. The EverArt API likely supports other sizes, but the MCP server doesn't expose them.

**No image editing or variation.** Modern image generation APIs support inpainting, outpainting, style transfer, image-to-image generation, and variations. This server supports none of that — it's text-to-image only. GPT Image 1.5, the current industry leader, treats editing as a core capability alongside generation.

**Browser-opening side effect.** The server automatically opens generated images in the default browser. This is a UI decision baked into a server that should be headless. In automated agent workflows — CI/CD, batch processing, background tasks — popping open browser tabs is actively disruptive. The URL is returned in the response, which is all the server should do.

**No image storage or management.** Generated images exist only as URLs pointing to EverArt's servers. There's no local download, no file management, no way to reference previous generations. The community fork [everart-forge-mcp](https://github.com/nickbaumann98/everart-forge-mcp) exists specifically to address this gap, adding local storage, format conversion, and image listing.

**Single tool limits agent reasoning.** One tool that does one thing gives agents no room to optimize. There's no "list available models" tool, no "check generation status" tool, no "get image details" tool. Compare this to the Exa MCP server (9 tools) or Sentry MCP server (~20 tools) — more tools give agents more ways to solve problems.

## Who Should Use This

**Almost nobody, in its current state.** The archived status, paid-only API, and minimal functionality make this hard to recommend. If you're already paying for EverArt and want the simplest possible MCP integration, it works. But there are better options for every use case.

## Who Shouldn't

**Anyone who wants production image generation.** The lack of size control, editing capabilities, and local storage makes this unsuitable for real workflows. Use a multi-provider MCP server instead.

**Anyone exploring image generation for the first time.** The $15/month minimum before you can generate a single image is a poor starting experience. OpenAI's GPT Image 1.5, accessible through community MCP servers, offers pay-per-image pricing that starts at zero.

## Alternatives

**[Recraft Official MCP Server](https://github.com/recraft-ai/mcp-recraft-server)** — The most relevant alternative, especially since EverArt's best models (Recraft-Real, Recraft-Vector) are Recraft's own. The official Recraft MCP server offers 16 tools: text-to-image, image-to-image, inpainting, background replacement, background removal, region erasing, vectorization, upscaling, and custom style management. If you're using EverArt primarily for Recraft models, this is a strict upgrade in every dimension. Recraft V4 is currently #1 on HuggingFace benchmarks for vector/logo generation.

**[merlinrabens/image-gen-mcp-server](https://github.com/merlinrabens/image-gen-mcp-server)** — Multi-provider MCP server supporting OpenAI DALL-E/GPT Image, Stability AI, and Google Gemini. Multiple providers with automatic fallback means you're not locked into one API. Better model coverage, better resilience.

**[spartanz51/imagegen-mcp](https://github.com/spartanz51/imagegen-mcp)** — OpenAI-focused MCP server for image generation and editing. Supports text-to-image and image-to-image with masking — the editing capabilities EverArt lacks. GPT Image 1.5 is the current industry leader for prompt understanding and text rendering.

**[nickbaumann98/everart-forge-mcp](https://github.com/nickbaumann98/everart-forge-mcp)** — Community fork that addresses EverArt's biggest gaps: local file storage, SVG optimization, format conversion, image listing, and image viewing. If you're committed to EverArt's API, use this instead. 10 stars, 8 forks, last updated February 2025.

**FAL.ai MCP servers** — FAL aggregates 600+ image generation models (FLUX 2, Recraft, Stable Diffusion, and more) through a single API. Faster inference than most providers (custom CUDA kernels), competitive pricing, and broader model access. The [fal-ai-image-generation MCP server](https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers/sshtunnelvision-fal-ai-image-generation) wraps this for agent use.

**[sammyl720/dall-e-image-generator](https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers/sammyl720-dall-e-image-generator)** — DALL-E/GPT Image MCP server. OpenAI's GPT Image 1.5 is the current industry benchmark for prompt understanding and text rendering. Pay-per-image pricing avoids the subscription commitment.

## The Verdict

{{< verdict rating="2.5" summary="A minimal reference implementation that demonstrates image generation over MCP, but the archived codebase, paid-only API, fixed resolution, and single tool make it hard to recommend when multi-provider alternatives exist." >}}

The EverArt MCP server earns a 2.5/5 because it occupies an awkward middle ground: too minimal to be useful in production, too expensive to be a good learning tool. One tool with no editing, no size control, no local storage, and a $50/month minimum entry fee (up from $15) — in a market where Recraft's own official MCP server offers 16 tools and multi-provider alternatives give you GPT Image 1.5, FLUX 2, and more.

The concept was sound. Agents that can generate images are more capable than agents that can only produce text. The MCP ecosystem needed good image generation servers. It now has them — just not this one. Downloads are down 64%, pricing has tripled, and the competitive landscape has left this server behind.

The model variety (FLUX, SD3.5, Recraft) was once the genuine strength — particularly Recraft-Vector for SVG output. But Recraft now has its own official MCP server with 16 tools, inpainting, upscaling, background removal, and custom styles. The one advantage EverArt had — access to Recraft models via MCP — is now better served by Recraft directly.

For everyone: look at Recraft's official MCP server for vector and raster generation, multi-provider MCP servers for GPT Image 1.5 and FLUX 2, or FAL.ai for access to 600+ models. The image generation MCP space has matured dramatically since this server was archived.
