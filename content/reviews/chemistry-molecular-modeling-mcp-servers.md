The Augmented-Nature organization dominates the database-access layer (PubChem, ChEMBL, PDB, AlphaFold, STRING-db, SureChEMBL) but most of their servers have low star counts. The category earns 3.5/5 — the breadth of coverage from databases to docking to dynamics is impressive for such a specialized field, ChatMol and the RDKit servers provide genuine cheminformatics utility, and the BioChemAIgent framework shows where multi-agent drug discovery is heading. But star counts are low across the board (~89 max), no major chemical software vendor ships an official MCP server (contrast with MathWorks for MATLAB), and critical workflows like quantum chemistry and retrosynthesis have no MCP coverage."

Chemistry and molecular modeling MCP servers let AI agents search chemical databases, compute molecular properties, run docking simulations, visualize protein structures, and perform molecular dynamics — all through the Model Context Protocol. Instead of manually querying PubChem, writing RDKit scripts, or setting up AutoDock Vina runs, researchers can have AI assistants handle these workflows conversationally. Part of our **[Science & Research MCP category](/categories/science-research/)**.

This review covers MCP servers for **chemistry and molecular modeling** — cheminformatics toolkits (RDKit), chemical databases (PubChem, ChEMBL, DrugBank), molecular visualization (PyMOL, ChimeraX), docking simulation (AutoDock Vina, DiffDock), protein structure (AlphaFold, PDB), molecular dynamics (LAMMPS, GROMACS), and pharmacology databases. For broader life sciences and genomics, see our [Bioinformatics & Life Sciences review](/reviews/bioinformatics-life-sciences-mcp-servers/). For numerical computing and symbolic math, see our [Scientific Computing & Mathematics review](/reviews/scientific-computing-mathematics-mcp-servers/).

The headline findings: **ChatMol/molecule-mcp leads visualization** (~89 stars) — connecting PyMOL and ChimeraX to AI agents. **RDKit gets two MCP servers** for full cheminformatics access through natural language. **Augmented-Nature ships a prolific suite** of database-access servers (PubChem, ChEMBL, AlphaFold, PDB, STRING-db, SureChEMBL). **BioChemAIgent integrates five docking methods** in one multi-agent framework. **No major chemical software vendor ships an official MCP server** — a notable gap compared to MathWorks' MATLAB support.

## Molecular Visualization

### ChatMol/molecule-mcp

| Server | Stars | Language | License |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| [molecule-mcp](https://github.com/ChatMol/molecule-mcp) | ~89 | Python | — |

The **highest-starred chemistry MCP server** we found. Molecule-MCP connects AI agents to PyMOL and ChimeraX — the two most widely used molecular visualization tools in structural biology and chemistry.

### What Works Well

**AI as co-scientist.** Claude can directly execute PyMOL and ChimeraX commands, render molecular structures, capture images, and analyze structural features. The workflow treats the AI as a collaborator, not just a query interface.

**Dual visualization backend.** Supports both PyMOL (the workhorse of protein crystallography) and UCSF ChimeraX (the modern successor to Chimera), with separate server scripts for each. Researchers can use whichever tool their lab prefers.

**GROMACS integration.** Beyond static visualization, molecule-mcp includes support for GROMACS molecular dynamics simulation workflows — setup, execution, and trajectory visualization in one server.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**Requires local installations.** PyMOL and/or ChimeraX must be installed locally. PyMOL has both open-source and commercial versions; ChimeraX is free for academic use but licensed commercially.

**Low documentation.** The repository is relatively sparse on setup instructions and example workflows compared to more mature MCP servers.

## Cheminformatics (RDKit)

### tandemai-inc/rdkit-mcp-server

| Server | Stars | Language | License |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| [rdkit-mcp-server](https://github.com/tandemai-inc/rdkit-mcp-server) | — | Python | — |

Built by TandemAI, this server aims to **expose every function in RDKit 2025.3.1** via MCP — molecular property calculation, fingerprinting, similarity search, substructure matching, and more, all through natural language without writing code.

### What Works Well

**Full RDKit coverage ambition.** Rather than wrapping a handful of functions, the stated goal is agent-level access to the entire RDKit API. This is the most ambitious cheminformatics MCP server in scope.

**Any MCP-compatible LLM.** Not locked to Claude — works with any LLM that supports MCP, making it useful across different AI platforms.

### s20ss/mcp_rdkit

| Server | Stars | Language | License |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| [mcp_rdkit](https://github.com/s20ss/mcp_rdkit) | — | Python | — |

A complementary RDKit MCP server focused on **molecular visualization, descriptor calculation, and chemical interaction tools**. Listed on MCP marketplaces as "RDKit Chemical Informatics Server" — provides a more curated subset of RDKit functionality compared to tandemai-inc's comprehensive approach.

## Chemical Databases

### Augmented-Nature/PubChem-MCP-Server

### cyanheads/pubchem-mcp-server

| Server | Stars | Language | License |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| [pubchem-mcp-server](https://github.com/cyanheads/pubchem-mcp-server) | — | — | — |

An independent PubChem MCP implementation providing comprehensive LLM tools for the PubChem PUG REST API. Offers an alternative to the Augmented-Nature version.

### Augmented-Nature/ChEMBL-MCP-Server

| Server | Stars | Language | License |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| [ChEMBL-MCP-Server](https://github.com/Augmented-Nature/ChEMBL-MCP-Server) | — | Python | — |

**22 specialized tools** for drug discovery research via the ChEMBL REST API:

- **Compound search and retrieval** — by name, structure, or identifier
- **Target search** — protein targets, gene names, organisms
- **Bioactivity lookup** — IC50, EC50, Ki values across assays
- **Similarity and substructure search** — find structurally related compounds
- **Drug-likeness analysis** — property summaries and filtering

ChEMBL contains bioactivity data for ~2.4 million compounds — this server makes that accessible conversationally. Also available from BioMCP-Hub and JackKuo666 as alternative implementations.

## Drug & Pharmacology Databases

### openpharma-org/drugbank-mcp-server

| Server | Stars | Language | License |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| [drugbank-mcp-server](https://github.com/openpharma-org/drugbank-mcp-server) | — | TypeScript | MIT |

Access to **17,430+ drugs** with a high-performance SQLite backend:

- **Sub-10ms queries** with 50-100MB memory usage
- **Search by name** (supports partial matching)
- **Search by structure** (SMILES or InChI)
- **Cross-database identifiers** — PubChem, ChEMBL, KEGG, RxCUI
- **Therapeutic category search**

A single unified `drugbank_info` tool with 16 methods. The SQLite approach means fast local queries without hitting external APIs — useful for offline research workflows.

### longevity-genie/pharmacology-mcp

| Server | Stars | Language | License |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| [pharmacology-mcp](https://github.com/longevity-genie/pharmacology-mcp) | — | Python | — |

Connects to the **Guide to PHARMACOLOGY** — the authoritative reference for drug targets, ligands, and interactions maintained by IUPHAR/BPS. Built with FastMCP for type safety and natural language queries.

Part of the **Holy Bio MCP** framework (longevity-genie/holy-bio-mcp), which bundles 50+ specialized bioinformatics tools under a unified configuration — pharmacology, OpenGenes (aging/longevity), and more.

### aditya-damerla128/Certus

| Server | Stars | Language | License |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| [Certus](https://github.com/aditya-damerla128/Certus) | — | — | — |

**Live FDA drug data** — shortages, recalls, and labeling via openFDA APIs. A production-ready MCP server for real-time, authoritative medication information. Integrates with Claude Desktop for clinical and regulatory workflows.

## Molecular Docking

### shogo-d-nakamura/mcp_vina

| Server | Stars | Language | License |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| [mcp_vina](https://github.com/shogo-d-nakamura/mcp_vina) | — | Python | — |

**AutoDock Vina docking from SMILES input.** Provide a SMILES string and a target protein name, and the server handles ligand preparation, receptor setup, and docking simulation. Currently supports AKT1 as a target, with the architecture designed for additional targets.

### What Works Well

**Low-friction docking.** Traditional docking workflows require manual ligand prep (OpenBabel), receptor prep (AutoDockTools), grid box configuration, and Vina execution. This server collapses that into a single MCP tool call.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**Limited target library.** Currently only AKT1 — researchers need to add their own targets. The gap between "one target demo" and "useful screening tool" is significant.

### BioChemAIgent (Multi-Docking Framework)

A research framework documented in a [bioRxiv preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2025.12.17.694892v1.full) that integrates **five docking methods** through MCP:

- **AutoDock Vina** — physics-based, the standard
- **Smina** — Vina fork with custom scoring
- **Gnina** — deep learning scoring function
- **DiffDock** — diffusion-based pose generation
- **AlphaFold 3** — structure prediction + docking

Built on CrewAI multi-agent architecture with PubChem-MCP-Server and PDB-MCP-Server as data sources, plus a custom BioChemAIgent-MCP-Server for protein modeling, ligand processing, and interaction analysis. This is the most ambitious integration of AI-driven drug discovery we've seen in the MCP ecosystem — but it's a research prototype, not a production tool.

## Protein Structure

### Augmented-Nature/AlphaFold-MCP-Server

| Server | Stars | Language | License |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| [AlphaFold-MCP-Server](https://github.com/Augmented-Nature/AlphaFold-MCP-Server) | — | Node.js | — |

All data retrieved directly from the official AlphaFold API — no local caching or storage.

### Augmented-Nature/PDB-MCP-Server

| Server | Stars | Language | License |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| [PDB-MCP-Server](https://github.com/Augmented-Nature/PDB-MCP-Server) | — | Node.js | — |

Access to the **Protein Data Bank** — the worldwide repository of experimentally determined 3D structures of proteins, nucleic acids, and complex assemblies. Search by keyword, PDB ID, or UniProt accession. Download coordinates in PDB, mmCIF, mmTF, or XML format. Quality metrics included.

### Augmented-Nature/STRING-db-MCP-Server

| Server | Stars | Language | License |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| [STRING-db-MCP-Server](https://github.com/Augmented-Nature/STRING-db-MCP-Server) | — | Node.js | — |

**Protein interaction network analysis** via the STRING database — interaction partners, functional enrichment, comparative genomics, and network visualization data. Useful for understanding protein function in biological context.

## Molecular Dynamics

### Chenghao-Wu/MCP_LAMMPS

| Server | Stars | Language | License |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| [MCP_LAMMPS](https://github.com/Chenghao-Wu/MCP_LAMMPS) | — | Python | — |

**LAMMPS molecular dynamics** through MCP — enables AI assistants to set up, configure, and run molecular dynamics simulations for autonomous computational materials design. Experimental status, part of a research workflow combining LLMs with atomistic simulation.

Supports SMILES input for molecular setup. The vision is AI-driven materials discovery where the agent designs, simulates, and analyzes materials properties autonomously.

## Chemical Naming & Patents

### tom832/chemdraw-server

| Server | Stars | Language | License |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| [chemdraw-server](https://github.com/tom832/chemdraw-server) | — | Python | — |

Converts between **ChemDraw chemical names and SMILES** — a unified FastAPI + MCP wrapper using RDKit as the backend. Supports name→SMILES, SMILES→name, and SMILES→RDKit molecule object conversion. Includes API key authentication and Prometheus monitoring.

### Augmented-Nature/SureChEMBL-MCP-Server

| Server | Stars | Language | License |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| [SureChEMBL-MCP-Server](https://github.com/Augmented-Nature/SureChEMBL-MCP-Server) | — | Node.js | — |

Access to the **SureChEMBL chemical patent database** — search patents by chemical structure, discover novel compounds in patent literature, and analyze patent-chemistry relationships. Valuable for IP landscaping in drug discovery.

## The Augmented-Nature Suite

One organization deserves special mention: **Augmented-Nature** ships MCP servers for nearly every major scientific database — PubChem, ChEMBL, AlphaFold, PDB, STRING-db, SureChEMBL, UniProt, and Reactome. Their approach is consistent (Node.js, REST API wrappers, standard MCP protocol) and comprehensive.

The trade-off: most of these servers have low star counts and appear to be generated with a consistent template. The question is whether they're production-tested or primarily proof-of-concept wrappers. For researchers who need quick API access through MCP, they fill an important gap.

## What's Missing

Notable gaps in the chemistry MCP ecosystem:

- **Quantum chemistry** — no Gaussian, ORCA, NWChem, or Psi4 MCP servers
- **Commercial drug discovery platforms** — no Schrödinger (Maestro/Glide), no Chemical Computing Group (MOE), no OpenEye
- **Molecular dynamics beyond LAMMPS** — no AMBER, NAMD, or Desmond servers
- **ADMET prediction** — no dedicated absorption/distribution/metabolism/excretion/toxicity server
- **Retrosynthesis** — no AI-driven retrosynthetic analysis (e.g., ASKCOS, IBM RXN)
- **Spectroscopy** — no NMR, mass spectrometry, or IR analysis servers
- **Materials science** — no Materials Studio, VASP (though VASPilot exists as a separate multi-agent system), or Quantum ESPRESSO MCP servers

## The Bottom Line

**Rating: 3.5/5** — Chemistry MCP servers cover an impressive breadth for such a specialized field: from database queries (PubChem, ChEMBL, DrugBank) through cheminformatics (RDKit) to molecular visualization (PyMOL/ChimeraX), docking (Vina, DiffDock), and molecular dynamics (LAMMPS). The BioChemAIgent framework shows where multi-agent drug discovery is heading.

But star counts are low across the board (~89 max), which means limited community testing. No major chemical software vendor ships an official MCP server — contrast this with MathWorks' official MATLAB server or DocuSign's official e-signature server. Critical computational chemistry workflows (quantum chemistry, retrosynthesis, ADMET) have zero MCP coverage. The Augmented-Nature suite provides breadth but uncertain depth.

For researchers already using PyMOL or RDKit, ChatMol and the RDKit MCP servers offer genuine utility today. For drug discovery workflows, the ChEMBL and DrugBank servers provide solid database access. For everything else, the ecosystem is still forming.
