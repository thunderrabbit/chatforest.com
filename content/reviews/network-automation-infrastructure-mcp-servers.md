card_description: "Network automation and infrastructure MCP servers for multi-vendor device management, DCIM/IPAM, SSH device automation, network diagnostics, and network digital twins. **Cisco dominates this category** — between the network-mcp-docker-suite (10 Docker-based MCP servers covering Meraki, Catalyst Center, IOS XE, ISE, ThousandEyes, Splunk, and NetBox), pyATS_MCP (66 stars, structured pyATS/Genie interaction), netclaw (135 stars, 82 skills across 37 MCP servers for autonomous network operations), and CML MCP (lab provisioning via natural language), the Cisco ecosystem has the most comprehensive MCP coverage of any network vendor. **For multi-vendor environments**, E-Conners-Lab/NetworkOps_Platform provides 178 tools supporting Cisco, Juniper, Nokia, Arista, and Linux devices with self-healing agents, drift detection, and a real-time web dashboard with force-directed topology visualization. **NetBox is the DCIM/IPAM standard** — netboxlabs/netbox-mcp-server (127 stars) provides official read-only access to device inventories, IP addressing, circuits, and rack layouts, making it the source of truth for AI-driven network operations. **SSH device automation** has multiple Netmiko-based options — melihteke/mcp-server-netmiko and upa/mcp-netmiko-server both wrap the popular Netmiko library for multi-vendor SSH sessions supporting Cisco, Juniper, Arista, and dozens more. **Network diagnostics are well-served** — patrickdappollonio/mcp-domaintools provides DNS lookups, WHOIS queries, TLS certificate analysis, HTTP endpoint monitoring, and connectivity testing in a single server. kumarprobeops/probeops-mcp-server runs diagnostics from 6 global regions (US East/West, EU Central, Canada, India, Australia) with zero API keys required. **For network analysis at scale**, forwardnetworks/forward-mcp (55+ tools) creates a vendor-agnostic network digital twin with path tracing, configuration auditing, topology analysis, and semantic search using embedding-based similarity. **Safety is a key theme** — netclaw enforces pre-change state capture and ServiceNow Change Request approval before any configuration push; NetworkOps_Platform includes drift detection; NetBox MCP is deliberately read-only. **Gaps remain** — no dedicated Juniper or Arista MCP server (only multi-vendor tools), no Palo Alto or Fortinet firewall MCP, no YANG/NETCONF-native MCP beyond what Juniper/netclaw provides, no carrier/ISP routing policy management, no Wi-Fi controller MCP (Meraki covers cloud-managed but not on-prem), and no network simulation/emulation beyond Cisco CML."

Network automation and infrastructure MCP servers let AI agents manage routers, switches, and firewalls across vendors, query DCIM/IPAM systems for device inventories, automate CLI commands over SSH, perform DNS and WHOIS lookups, trace network paths, and interact with network digital twins — all through natural language. Instead of writing Ansible playbooks or SSH scripts, an AI agent can ask "show me all BGP neighbors on the core routers" or "what IPs are available in the 10.0.1.0/24 subnet" and get structured results.

This review covers **network automation and infrastructure MCP servers** — multi-vendor management platforms, Cisco-specific tools, DCIM/IPAM, SSH device automation, network diagnostics, and network digital twins. For security-focused network tools (packet capture, port scanning, pentesting), see our [Network Security review](/reviews/network-security-mcp-servers/). For monitoring and observability platforms, see [Time-Series Database MCP](/reviews/time-series-database-mcp-servers/).

The headline findings: **Cisco has the strongest MCP ecosystem** of any network vendor, with 10+ dedicated servers covering everything from Meraki cloud networking to IOS XE device management. **Multi-vendor platforms are ambitious** — NetworkOps_Platform provides 178 tools across 5 vendors. **NetBox is the DCIM/IPAM standard** with an official MCP server. **Network diagnostics have solid coverage** with DNS, WHOIS, TLS, and distributed probing available. **Safety-first design is emerging** — several servers enforce change control workflows and read-only access by default.

**Enterprise-grade network analysis** powered by Forward Networks' vendor-agnostic digital twin technology:

- **55+ tools** for network topology analysis, path tracing, device management, and configuration auditing
- **Path verification** — trace traffic paths across the entire network, identify where packets would be dropped or redirected
- **Semantic search** using embedding-based similarity matching of network queries (NQE)
- **Bloomsearch integration** for efficient handling of large result sets with automatic bloom filter generation
- **Snapshot management** for point-in-time network state capture and comparison
- **Instance lock protection** to prevent multiple server instances
- Works with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients via stdio

Forward Enterprise creates a mathematical model of your entire network — this MCP server makes that model queryable by AI agents. The path tracing capability is unique: ask "can traffic from 10.0.1.5 reach the database server on port 5432?" and get a definitive answer based on the actual forwarding tables and ACLs.

## What's Missing

Despite strong coverage for Cisco and multi-vendor platforms, significant gaps remain:

- **No dedicated Juniper MCP** — Juniper/JunOS access is only available through multi-vendor tools like netclaw (via PyEZ/NETCONF) and NetworkOps_Platform
- **No Arista-specific MCP** — same situation, only available through multi-vendor platforms
- **No Palo Alto or Fortinet firewall MCP** — firewall management is absent from the MCP ecosystem
- **No YANG/NETCONF-native MCP** — model-driven programmability, the industry's future direction, has no dedicated MCP server
- **No carrier/ISP routing policy management** — BGP policy, route filtering, and peering management tools are missing
- **No Wi-Fi controller MCP** (beyond Meraki cloud-managed) — on-premises wireless management is uncovered
- **No network simulation/emulation** beyond Cisco CML — no GNS3, EVE-NG, or Containerlab MCP
- **No SD-WAN management MCP** — despite SD-WAN being widely deployed
- **No SNMP-first MCP** — while SNMP SSE exists, there's no comprehensive SNMP management server

---

## The Bottom Line

Network automation MCP servers are in an exciting early phase. **Cisco leads** with the most comprehensive vendor-specific MCP ecosystem — between netclaw's 82 skills, the Docker suite's 10 servers, and pyATS integration, Cisco shops have strong AI automation options today. **Multi-vendor platforms are ambitious but early** — NetworkOps_Platform's 178 tools across 5 vendors is impressive scope, though maturity varies. **NetBox provides the source of truth** that all these tools need — official MCP access to the industry-standard DCIM/IPAM is foundational. **Safety-first design is encouraging** — the emphasis on read-only defaults, pre-change state capture, and change control integration shows the community understands the stakes of AI-driven network changes.

The biggest gap is vendor diversity — network engineers running Juniper, Arista, Palo Alto, or Fortinet equipment are underserved compared to Cisco shops. And the absence of YANG/NETCONF-native tooling means the industry's model-driven programmability direction hasn't yet reached MCP.

**Rating: 4/5** — Strong Cisco coverage, impressive multi-vendor ambition, solid diagnostics tooling, and emerging safety-first patterns. Points off for vendor concentration and missing next-generation programmability standards.
