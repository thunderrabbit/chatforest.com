Email is the most sensitive data most people have. Bank confirmations, medical records, password resets, private conversations — it's all in your inbox. Giving an AI agent access to it deserves serious thought.

That said, the use cases are compelling. An agent that can search your email for a specific receipt, draft a reply to a client, or triage your inbox by priority could save hours per week. The Gmail MCP ecosystem is trying to make this happen, with varying degrees of maturity and security. Part of our **[Communication & Collaboration MCP category](/categories/communication-collaboration/)**.

## The Landscape

Unlike most MCP categories, Gmail has no official reference server from the MCP project (modelcontextprotocol/servers). What it does have is:

1. **Google's own MCP endpoint** — a remote Workspace MCP server covering Gmail, Calendar, Docs, Sheets, and more
2. **taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp** — the dominant community server (1,700+ stars), covering 12 Google services
3. **MarkusPfundstein/mcp-gsuite** — a focused Gmail + Calendar server (477 stars)
4. **Several Gmail-only servers** — ranging from well-maintained to abandoned

## Google's Official Workspace MCP

**What it is:** Google maintains remote MCP servers at `https://workspace-developer.goog/mcp`, covering Gmail alongside Docs, Sheets, Slides, Calendar, and other Workspace services.

**Why it matters:** This is Google providing first-party MCP access to their own APIs. No third-party code touching your credentials. No local token storage. The server runs on Google's infrastructure with Google's security model.

**The catch:** Documentation is sparse compared to community options. The tool surface isn't as well-documented for MCP-specific integration, and the remote-only model means you can't inspect or modify the server code. You're trusting Google's implementation entirely — which, for a Google service, is probably fine.

## taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp — The Community Standard

**What it is:** The most popular Google Workspace MCP server by a wide margin. [google_workspace_mcp](https://github.com/taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp) (1,700+ stars) covers 12 Google services with 100+ tools total. Gmail is one piece of a much larger puzzle.

**Gmail tools:**

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| Search messages | Gmail query syntax (from:, subject:, has:attachment, etc.) |
| Get message content | Full email body, headers, metadata |
| Send email | New messages with recipients, subject, body |
| Reply to email | Reply to existing threads |
| Create draft | New drafts and reply drafts |
| List labels | All Gmail labels (system + custom) |
| Create/update/delete labels | Full label management |
| Add/remove labels | Apply or remove labels from messages |

**Setup:** `pip install workspace-mcp` or Docker. Supports OAuth 2.1 with remote multi-user capability. Also has a 1-click Claude Desktop install option.

**What works:** The three-tier tool system (Core/Extended/Full) is smart — you can start with read-only access and expand as trust builds. The breadth is impressive: if you're already using this for Google Calendar or Docs, adding Gmail is trivial. Active maintenance with frequent releases (v1.6.0 as of this writing). CLI mode for use outside MCP.

**What doesn't:** The breadth is also a risk. Installing this server gives the OAuth token access to 12 Google services. If you only need Gmail, you're granting permissions you don't need. The `gmail.modify` scope is powerful — an agent with this access can delete emails, not just read them.

## MarkusPfundstein/mcp-gsuite — The Focused Alternative

**What it is:** [mcp-gsuite](https://github.com/MarkusPfundstein/mcp-gsuite) (477 stars, 96 forks) covers Gmail and Google Calendar only. If you don't need Docs, Sheets, Slides, and the rest, this is a narrower-scope option.

**Gmail tools:** Query emails (flexible search), get email by ID, create draft, delete draft, reply to emails, save attachments.

**Setup:** Python (requires 3.13+), install via pip or uvx. OAuth2 authentication.

**Why consider it:** Smaller scope means fewer OAuth permissions requested. The tool set covers the most common email operations without the overhead of a 12-service server. Actively maintained (v0.4.1).

**Limitation:** The Python 3.13+ requirement is unusually strict — many systems still run 3.11 or 3.12. The tool count is modest (6 Gmail tools vs. 10+ in the Workspace server).

## Gmail-Only Servers

### GongRzhe/Gmail-MCP-Server (and ArtyMcLabin fork)

The [original server](https://github.com/GongRzhe/Gmail-MCP-Server) was once popular but has been **abandoned since August 2025** — 72+ unmerged pull requests and counting. The [ArtyMcLabin fork](https://github.com/ArtyMcLabin/Gmail-MCP-Server) is the active continuation.

**Tools:** Send email (plain text, HTML, multipart + attachments), create draft, get email by ID, search emails, add/remove labels, create/update/delete labels, batch processing (up to 50 emails at once).

**Install:** `npm install @gongrzhe/server-gmail-mcp` (also available via Smithery).

**Notable:** Batch processing of up to 50 emails at once is unique among Gmail MCP servers. But the maintenance situation is a red flag — use the ArtyMcLabin fork if you go this route.

### baryhuang/mcp-headless-gmail

**What it is:** [mcp-headless-gmail](https://github.com/baryhuang/mcp-headless-gmail) (53 stars) is designed for server/container deployments where no browser is available for OAuth flow.

**Why it's interesting:** The decoupled credential model — OAuth flow can be completed by any client, credentials passed as context — is a genuine security advantage for multi-user or containerized setups. Most Gmail MCP servers assume you have a browser for the OAuth dance, which doesn't work in headless environments.

**Tools:** Get recent emails (first 1K chars), get full email body (chunked with offset), send emails, token refresh. Minimal but functional.

### shinzo-labs/gmail-mcp

[gmail-mcp](https://github.com/shinzo-labs/gmail-mcp) (34 stars) attempts full Gmail API coverage — messages, threads, labels, drafts, settings, push notifications, and profile retrieval. Install via npx. The settings and push notification management tools are broader than most servers offer, which means broader permissions required.

### Other Servers

- **theposch/gmail-mcp** (17 stars) — minimal server with send and read. GPL-3.0 licensed.
- **cafferychen777/gmail-mcp** — Chrome extension approach. No OAuth setup needed (uses browser session), but only works with a running Chrome instance.
- **david-strejc/gmail-mcp-server** — uses IMAP/SMTP instead of the Gmail API. Works with app-specific passwords. Could theoretically work with any IMAP email provider, not just Gmail.

## The Security Question

Gmail MCP servers deserve more security scrutiny than most MCP categories. Here's why:

**OAuth scope creep.** Most servers request `gmail.modify` or even the full `mail.google.com` scope. This grants read, write, send, and delete access to your entire email history. Few servers offer a read-only mode.

**Token storage.** OAuth refresh tokens are typically stored in local files. If your machine is compromised, your email is compromised. The headless-gmail server's decoupled model is a notable exception.

**Send permission.** An AI agent that can send emails on your behalf is powerful and dangerous. A hallucinated email sent to the wrong person could cause real damage. There's no "undo send" via the API.

**No official reference server.** The MCP project maintains reference servers for filesystem, fetch, GitHub, and others — but not Gmail. Every option is community-built (except Google's own endpoint). This means varying quality, security practices, and maintenance commitments.

**Our recommendation:** Start with read-only access if your chosen server supports it (taylorwilsdon's tier system does). Only enable send/compose after you've built confidence in the agent's behavior. And seriously consider Google's own endpoint if you're uncomfortable with third-party code handling your email credentials.

## Which One Should You Use?

**For most users:** [taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp](https://github.com/taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp) is the default choice. Largest community, most active development, broadest feature set, tiered permissions. If you're already using Google Workspace, start here.

**For Gmail + Calendar only:** [MarkusPfundstein/mcp-gsuite](https://github.com/MarkusPfundstein/mcp-gsuite) gives you what you need without the 12-service scope. Narrower permissions is a real security advantage.

**For server/headless deployments:** [baryhuang/mcp-headless-gmail](https://github.com/baryhuang/mcp-headless-gmail) is purpose-built for environments without a browser.

**For maximum trust:** Google's own Workspace MCP endpoint. First-party code, Google's security model, no third-party token handling.

**Avoid:** The original GongRzhe/Gmail-MCP-Server (abandoned). Use the ArtyMcLabin fork if you want that codebase.

## The Bottom Line

Gmail MCP servers work. The ecosystem is mature enough for real use, with taylorwilsdon's Workspace server and Google's own endpoint providing solid options. The tool coverage is good — search, read, draft, send, label management.

But this is the category where security matters most. Your email is the skeleton key to your digital life (password resets, 2FA codes, financial confirmations). Every Gmail MCP server is asking you to hand that key to an AI agent running third-party code.

The technology is ready. The question is whether your risk tolerance is.

**Rating: 3.5/5** — Solid functionality with multiple mature options, but the inherent security sensitivity of email access and lack of an official MCP reference server keep the ceiling lower than less sensitive categories.
