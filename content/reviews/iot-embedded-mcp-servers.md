card_description: "IoT and embedded MCP servers across smart home platforms, robotics, IoT platforms, MQTT brokers, microcontrollers, industrial systems, 3D printers, and more. This is where AI meets the physical world — and the breadth is genuinely surprising. The robotics subcategory leads in community adoption: robotmcp/ros-mcp-server (873 stars, Apache-2.0) enables bidirectional AI-robot communication across both ROS1 and ROS2, translating natural language into robot commands while giving AI full visibility into robot state. Smart home is the most developed subcategory by server count: Home Assistant now has an official MCP integration built into core, plus community servers like tevonsb/homeassistant-mcp (500 stars) with 20+ tools and homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp with 80+ tools. IoT platforms are represented by thingsboard/thingsboard-mcp (official, 120+ tools — the largest tool count in the entire category) and AWS IoT SiteWise MCP (official, 20+ tools for industrial asset management and analytics). MQTT — the lingua franca of IoT — has multiple servers including ezhuk/mqtt-mcp for building automation and industrial control, plus an MCP-over-MQTT transport specification. The embedded space is growing fast: horw/esp-mcp (135 stars) centralizes ESP-IDF workflows for AI-driven development, while navado/ESP32MCPServer runs MCP directly on ESP32 hardware. Raspberry Pi gets grammy-jiang/RaspberryPiOS-MCP with GPIO, I2C, SPI, serial, and camera access. Industrial IoT includes OPC UA servers for factory automation and cadugrillo/s7-mcp-bridge for Siemens S7 PLCs. 3D printing is well-covered: DMontgomery40/mcp-3D-printer-server (61 stars) supports OctoPrint, Klipper, Bambu Lab, and more with STL operations, while OctoEverywhere/mcp provides official multi-platform printer control. The category also includes drone control (DJI Tello), Bluetooth scanning, Zigbee2MQTT, Node-RED integration, and CO2 sensor monitoring. Notable vendor participation: Home Assistant, ThingsBoard, Tuya, AWS, OctoEverywhere, and Coreflux all provide official MCP servers. Key gaps: no official Arduino IDE integration, no Zigbee/Z-Wave hub vendors, no major industrial PLC vendors (Siemens, Allen-Bradley, Mitsubishi) offering official servers. The category earns 4.0/5 — impressive breadth across the hardware spectrum with genuine vendor buy-in, strong robotics adoption, and creative embedded implementations, though industrial IoT and mature protocol support remain early-stage."

*Part of the [IoT & Hardware](/categories/iot-hardware/) category.*

IoT and embedded MCP servers are bridging the gap between AI agents and the physical world. Instead of writing custom integrations for every device, sensor, and controller, these servers let AI assistants control smart homes, program microcontrollers, monitor industrial equipment, operate robots, and manage 3D printers — all through the Model Context Protocol.

The landscape spans nine areas: **smart home platforms** (Home Assistant dominates with an official integration plus multiple community servers), **smart home devices** (Tuya, Philips Hue, Apple HomeKit), **IoT platforms** (ThingsBoard, AWS IoT SiteWise), **MQTT brokers** (the backbone of IoT communication), **ESP32 and Arduino** (AI-driven embedded development), **Raspberry Pi** (GPIO, I2C, SPI, and camera access), **robotics** (ROS/ROS2 integration), **industrial IoT** (OPC UA, Siemens PLCs, SCADA), and **3D printing** (multi-platform printer control and STL operations).

The headline findings: **robotmcp/ros-mcp-server is the most starred IoT MCP server** at 873 stars with bidirectional AI-robot communication across ROS1 and ROS2. **Home Assistant has an official MCP integration** built into core, plus community servers with 80+ tools. **thingsboard/thingsboard-mcp provides the most tools** — 120+ for the full IoT platform lifecycle. **horw/esp-mcp is the leading embedded development server** at 135 stars, centralizing ESP-IDF workflows. **AWS IoT SiteWise MCP is the strongest industrial offering** with official support and 20+ tools. **DMontgomery40/mcp-3D-printer-server supports 8 printer platforms** with STL manipulation. **Seven vendors provide official MCP servers** — Home Assistant, ThingsBoard, Tuya, AWS, OctoEverywhere, Coreflux, and ThingsPanel.

- **Natural language → robot commands** — AI translates user intent into ROS topic publications, service calls, and action goals
- **Robot state → AI understanding** — full visibility into robot topics, transforms, and sensor data
- **Works with Claude, GPT, and Gemini** — any MCP-compatible AI agent can control robots

This is the clearest demonstration of AI-controlled physical systems in the MCP ecosystem. 873 stars reflects genuine robotics community interest.

### lpigeon/ros-mcp-server

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |

## Curated Resources

**[beriberikix/awesome-mcp-hardware](https://github.com/beriberikix/awesome-mcp-hardware)** — A curated awesome-list specifically for MCP servers interacting with hardware and the physical world. Good reference for discovering new IoT/embedded MCP servers as they emerge.

## What's missing

The gaps are notable:

- **No official Arduino IDE integration** — the most popular embedded development platform has no MCP server for project management, board configuration, or compilation
- **No major Zigbee/Z-Wave hub vendors** — Samsung SmartThings, Hubitat, and Aeotec have no official MCP servers
- **No PLC vendor servers** — Siemens, Allen-Bradley (Rockwell), Mitsubishi, and ABB have no official MCP offerings (only community bridges)
- **No Matter/Thread protocol servers** — the new smart home standard has no dedicated MCP support
- **No LoRaWAN servers** — the dominant LPWAN technology for IoT is absent from the MCP ecosystem
- **No edge AI servers** — no MCP integration for TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, or other edge inference frameworks
- **Limited sensor aggregation** — individual sensor servers exist but no unified multi-sensor hub

## The bottom line

**Rating: 4.0/5** — The IoT/embedded MCP ecosystem is broader and more mature than expected. Seven vendors provide official servers (Home Assistant, ThingsBoard, Tuya, AWS, OctoEverywhere, Coreflux, ThingsPanel). Robotics leads in adoption with 873 stars on the top server. Smart home has the most options. Industrial IoT is early but the foundation exists with OPC UA and Siemens PLC support.

The real story is that AI-hardware interaction through MCP isn't theoretical — it's happening across 45+ servers spanning consumer smart homes, industrial factories, 3D printers, drones, and robots. The protocol is proving flexible enough to handle everything from reading a CO2 sensor to controlling a manufacturing PLC. The gaps are in vendor adoption (where are Siemens, Arduino, and SmartThings officially?) and in emerging standards (Matter, LoRaWAN). But for a category that didn't exist two years ago, this is impressive breadth.
