card_description: "Education and LMS MCP servers across learning management systems, educational content platforms, spaced repetition tools, coding education, math tutoring, and academic research. Canvas LMS is the runaway leader — no other platform comes close to the depth of MCP integration. Six independent Canvas MCP servers have emerged, led by vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp with 90+ tools spanning course management, discussion boards, rubric-based bulk grading, assignment analytics, and code execution — all with FERPA-compliant data anonymization. DMontgomery40/mcp-canvas-lms (60 stars, MIT) provides 54 tools as the most starred Canvas server. The diversity of Canvas implementations (Python, TypeScript, some combining Gradescope or macOS Calendar integration) reflects genuine student and instructor demand. Moodle, the world's most widely deployed open-source LMS, has peancor/moodle-mcp-server (27 stars) with 8+ tools for student management, assignments, quizzes, and grading — importantly with read AND write access for providing feedback. Google Classroom has minimal coverage (3 tools), while D2L Brightspace has a creative web-scraping approach since students lack official API access. Educational content servers include EduBase/MCP (official, full e-learning platform with advanced quiz parametrization, SCORM support, and cheating detection), openedu-mcp (20+ tools aggregating OpenLibrary/Wikipedia/arXiv/Dictionary APIs with grade-level filtering), and O'Reilly's official discovery MCP (built by their CTO). Spaced repetition is well-served by ankimcp/anki-mcp-server with 27 tools covering deck sync, card review, note management with media files, and evidence-based flashcard creation prompts. Coding education features jinzcdev/leetcode-mcp-server (57+ stars) supporting both global and Chinese LeetCode with advanced search, plus interactive-leetcode-mcp enforcing pedagogical best practices with progressive 4-level hints before revealing solutions. Math tutoring gets a dedicated server with 12+ tools for calculation, statistics, plotting, and formula explanation. The category earns 3.5/5 — Canvas integration is genuinely impressive, spaced repetition and coding education are well-covered, but massive gaps remain. No Blackboard, Khan Academy, Coursera, edX, Duolingo, or PowerSchool MCP servers exist. The positive signal: Instructure (Canvas vendor) announced IgniteAgent at InstructureCon 2025 with MCP as its integration standard — the first major LMS vendor to officially adopt the protocol, expected in 2026."

*Part of the [Education & Learning](/categories/education-learning/) category.*

Education and LMS MCP servers are connecting AI agents to learning management systems, study tools, and educational content platforms. Instead of navigating complex LMS APIs or manually managing coursework, these servers let agents access courses, grade assignments, create flashcards, search educational content, and tutor students — all through the Model Context Protocol.

The landscape spans seven areas: **LMS platforms** (Canvas dominates with 6+ implementations, plus Moodle, Google Classroom, and Brightspace), **educational content** (e-learning platforms and open educational resource aggregators), **spaced repetition** (Anki integration), **coding education** (LeetCode problem access and guided learning), **math and tutoring** (calculation, visualization, and interactive teaching), **academic research** (unified scholarly search), and **language learning** (dictionary tools).

The headline findings: **Canvas LMS has more MCP implementations than any other education platform** — six independent servers from both instructor and student perspectives. **vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp leads with 90+ tools** including FERPA-compliant data anonymization and rubric-based bulk grading. **DMontgomery40/mcp-canvas-lms is the most starred** at 60 stars with 54 tools. **ankimcp/anki-mcp-server provides the deepest study tool integration** with 27 tools for full Anki deck and card management. **jinzcdev/leetcode-mcp-server supports both leetcode.com and leetcode.cn** with advanced search and filtering. **Instructure announced IgniteAgent** — the first major LMS vendor to officially adopt MCP as its agent integration standard. **No Blackboard, Khan Academy, Coursera, edX, or Duolingo MCP servers exist** despite their massive user bases.

### Traves-Theberge/Word_of_the_day

Daily vocabulary learning via the free Dictionary API with word definitions and random vocabulary features.

## What's Missing

The gaps in education MCP servers are striking:

- **Blackboard/Ultra** — no MCP server despite being the second-largest LMS globally
- **Khan Academy** — no MCP server despite being the most popular free learning platform
- **Coursera / edX** — no MCP servers for the two largest MOOC platforms
- **Duolingo / Memrise** — no language learning app integration
- **PowerSchool** — no student information system MCP servers
- **Turnitin** — no plagiarism detection integration
- **Classroom management** (attendance, behavior tracking) — completely absent

The concentration around Canvas (6+ servers) versus the absence of Blackboard (0 servers) likely reflects Canvas's developer-friendly API and the university CS student demographic most likely to build MCP servers.

## The Bottom Line

**Rating: 3.5 / 5** — Canvas LMS integration is genuinely impressive, with the deepest MCP coverage of any single education platform. Spaced repetition (Anki) and coding education (LeetCode) are well-served. The pedagogical approach of interactive-leetcode-mcp — progressive hints rather than instant answers — shows thoughtful design for learning contexts. EduBase's official server brings enterprise e-learning features. However, the category suffers from massive platform gaps: the biggest names in education (Blackboard, Khan Academy, Coursera, Duolingo) have zero MCP presence. Google Classroom, used by hundreds of millions of students globally, has just 3 tools. Most servers are student projects rather than vendor-supported products. The bright spot: Instructure's IgniteAgent announcement signals that LMS vendors are beginning to take MCP seriously, which could catalyze broader adoption in 2026.

*ChatForest independently researches MCP servers using publicly available information — GitHub repositories, documentation, and community discussions. We do not have hands-on access to every server reviewed. Star counts reflect the time of research and may have changed. Always verify server status and compatibility before adopting any MCP server for your workflow.*
