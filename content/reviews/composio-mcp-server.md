**At a glance:** 27,500 stars, 4,500 forks, MIT license, TypeScript/Python SDKs, stdio + HTTPS transport, 1,000+ toolkits across 500+ apps, $29M funded (Series A).

Composio is an **agentic integration platform** that connects AI agents to 500+ SaaS applications through a unified MCP endpoint. Rather than installing and configuring separate MCP servers for each service, Composio acts as a gateway — one server that routes requests to Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Notion, Salesforce, HubSpot, Google Sheets, Linear, Jira, and hundreds of other apps.

The [ComposioHQ/composio repository](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/composio) has 27,500 GitHub stars and 4,500 forks. The company raised $29M total — a $4M seed from Together Fund and a $25M Series A led by Lightspeed Venture Partners (March 2025), with participation from Elevation Capital. As of early 2026, Composio has ~57 employees, 200+ paying customers, and hit $2M in revenue by mid-2025.

## What It Does

Composio provides two MCP access patterns:

### 1. Single-Toolkit MCP Servers

Create dedicated MCP servers for specific apps. Each server exposes only the tools for that particular integration:

```
AI Agent → MCP Client → Composio MCP Server (Gmail) → Gmail API
AI Agent → MCP Client → Composio MCP Server (GitHub) → GitHub API
```

You configure which toolkit and which specific tools to expose. For example, a Gmail server might only allow `GMAIL_FETCH_EMAILS` and `GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL`, keeping the tool surface minimal.

### 2. Rube — Universal MCP Server

[Rube](https://rube.composio.dev) is Composio's all-in-one MCP server that connects to all 500+ apps through a single endpoint. Instead of exposing every tool to the model (which would overwhelm the context window), Rube uses **dynamic tool discovery**:

| Meta-Tool | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS** | Inspects task descriptions and returns only relevant tools and toolkits |
| **RUBE_CREATE_PLAN** | Structures complex multi-app workflows into sequential/parallel steps |

This solves the context overload problem — rather than loading thousands of tool definitions, the model starts with just these meta-tools and discovers specific tools as needed.

**Example workflow:** "Forward my Medium newsletter emails to a Notion database" → Rube identifies the needed Gmail tools (search, fetch) and Notion tools (search pages, create page, add content), loads only those, and executes the workflow.

## Supported Apps (Sample)

Composio connects to 500+ apps across categories:

| Category | Example Apps |
|----------|-------------|
| **Productivity** | Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Sheets, Google Drive, Notion, Todoist, Airtable |
| **Communication** | Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, WhatsApp, Outlook |
| **Developer Tools** | GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Linear, Sentry, Datadog |
| **CRM & Sales** | Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive |
| **Social Media** | X (Twitter), Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn |
| **Design** | Figma, Canva |
| **Finance** | Stripe, QuickBooks, Shopify |
| **Marketing** | Mailchimp, SendGrid, ActiveCampaign |

Each app comes with pre-built tool definitions covering common operations (CRUD, search, notifications, etc.).

## Authentication

Authentication is Composio's core differentiator. The platform handles:

- **Managed OAuth** — Composio manages the full OAuth flow for each app. Users authenticate once through Composio's UI, and tokens are encrypted end-to-end. The MCP server never exposes credentials to the LLM.
- **Token lifecycle** — Automatic refresh, rotation, and revocation management.
- **Multi-tenant support** — Each user gets isolated credentials via `user_id` parameters. A single Composio server can serve multiple users without credential mixing.
- **API key enforcement** — As of March 2026, all new organizations require `x-api-key` headers on MCP requests by default.

This eliminates the biggest pain point of self-hosted MCP servers: manually configuring OAuth flows, managing token expiry, and securing credentials for each integration.

## Setup

### Single-Toolkit (Python)

```python
from composio import Composio
client = Composio(api_key="YOUR_KEY")
server = client.mcp.create(toolkit="gmail", allowed_tools=["GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL"])
```

### Single-Toolkit (TypeScript)

```typescript
import { Composio } from "@composio/core";
const client = new Composio({ apiKey: "YOUR_KEY" });
```

### Rube (Claude Desktop / Cursor)

Install via npx:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rube": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@composio/rube-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Rube also works with Claude Code, VS Code, Windsurf, and any MCP-compatible client.

### Hosted Endpoint

For programmatic access, Composio provides HTTPS endpoints:
```
https://backend.composio.dev/v3/mcp/[SERVER_ID]?user_id=[USER_ID]
```

This supports Streamable HTTP transport for remote MCP clients.

## Framework Support

Beyond MCP, Composio's SDKs integrate natively with:

- **OpenAI** (function calling)
- **Anthropic** (tool use)
- **LangChain** / **LlamaIndex**
- **CrewAI** / **AutoGen**
- **Google Gemini**
- **Mastra**

This means you can use Composio's integrations whether your client supports MCP or not.

## Company & Ecosystem

- **Founded:** 2023
- **Funding:** $29M total ($4M seed + $25M Series A)
- **Lead investors:** Lightspeed Venture Partners, Elevation Capital, Together Fund
- **Employees:** ~57 (January 2026)
- **Revenue:** $2M by mid-2025, 200+ paying customers
- **Repository:** 27,500 stars, 4,500 forks, 3,410 commits, MIT license
- **Rube:** 322 stars (separate repo), released August 2025

The company positions itself as "the integration layer for AI agents" — handling auth, tool management, and API routing so developers focus on agent logic.

## Pricing

| Plan | Monthly Cost | Tool Calls | Support |
|------|-------------|------------|---------|
| **Free** | $0 | 20,000/mo | Community |
| **Starter** | $29 | 200,000/mo | Email |
| **Professional** | $229 | 2,000,000/mo | Slack |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom | Dedicated SLA, SOC 2, VPC/on-prem |

Overage: $0.299/1K calls (Starter), $0.249/1K calls (Professional).

The free tier is genuinely generous — 20,000 tool calls per month with no credit card required. That's enough for meaningful prototyping and small-scale production.

## Comparison

| Feature | Composio | Pipedream MCP | Zapier MCP | Individual Servers |
|---------|----------|---------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Apps** | 500+ | 2,800+ | 8,000+ | 1 per server |
| **MCP tools** | 1,000+ toolkits | 10,000+ auto-generated | Varies by action | Purpose-built |
| **Auth management** | Managed OAuth | Managed OAuth | Managed (existing Zapier) | Manual per-server |
| **Context management** | Dynamic discovery (Rube) | Per-app endpoints | Action-based | N/A |
| **Self-hosted** | Yes (SDK) | npx (stale) | No | Yes |
| **Free tier** | 20K calls/mo | 100 credits | 100 tasks/mo | Unlimited (self-hosted) |
| **License** | MIT | Proprietary | Proprietary | Varies |
| **Transport** | stdio + HTTPS | HTTP/SSE/stdio | HTTPS | Varies |

**vs. Pipedream:** Pipedream has far more integrations (2,800+ apps) but auto-generates tools from API specs, leading to variable quality. Composio's tools are more curated. Pipedream was acquired by Workday (November 2025), introducing platform uncertainty. Composio remains independent.

**vs. Zapier:** Zapier covers 8,000+ apps but its task-based pricing can escalate quickly with AI agents that make many small calls. Composio's tool-call pricing is more predictable for agent workloads.

**vs. Individual servers:** Purpose-built servers (like the GitHub MCP Server or Slack MCP Server) offer deeper, more reliable integration for their specific service. Composio trades depth for breadth — convenient when you need many integrations, less ideal when you need every feature of one API.

## Known Issues

- **Parameter mismatch bug** — The Python SDK's `MCP.update()` method incorrectly maps `allowed_tools` to `custom_tools`, causing TypeErrors when updating server configurations ([#2161](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/composio/issues/2161)).
- **LlamaIndex schema parsing** — Composio's JSON schemas use `additionalProperties: false`, which caused parsing failures in LlamaIndex's MCP tool parser (fixed upstream in LlamaIndex).
- **Context window consumption** — Even with Rube's dynamic discovery, adding Composio's meta-tools still consumes context. In Cursor, the 30-tool limit means Composio competes with other MCP servers for tool slots.
- **Tool quality varies by app** — Popular apps (Gmail, GitHub, Slack) have well-tested tools. Less popular integrations may have incomplete or untested tool definitions.
- **Composio MCP deprecation** — The original `mcp.composio.dev` hosted MCP servers are being deprecated in favor of Rube and the platform SDK. Migration is underway but may cause confusion for existing users.
- **79 open GitHub issues** — Active development means bugs surface regularly, though the team is responsive.

## What We Think

**Rating: 3.5 out of 5**

Composio solves the right problem: connecting AI agents to dozens of apps without manually configuring OAuth flows and MCP servers for each one. The managed authentication alone saves significant development time, and the free tier (20K calls/month) is generous enough for real work.

**Rube's dynamic tool discovery** is a smart answer to context overload — instead of flooding the model with hundreds of tool definitions, it lets the model search for and load tools on demand. This is the direction multi-app MCP should go.

**Where it falls short:** Composio is a gateway, not a deep integration. Purpose-built MCP servers for individual services (GitHub, Slack, Notion) will always offer more complete API coverage and better tool design. Composio's value is in breadth — when you need 10+ integrations, setting up 10 separate MCP servers with individual OAuth configurations is painful.

The platform is also in active transition — the original Composio MCP is being deprecated, Rube is still gaining adoption (322 stars vs. the main repo's 27.5K), and the SDK has rough edges (parameter mismatch bugs, schema compatibility issues). Early adopters should expect some friction.

**Best for:** Teams building multi-app AI agents who need many integrations quickly. **Not ideal for:** Deep single-service automation where a dedicated MCP server would be more complete and reliable.
