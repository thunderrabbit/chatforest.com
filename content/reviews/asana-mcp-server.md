Asana's official MCP server gives AI agents direct access to the Asana Work Graph — the full graph of tasks, projects, goals, portfolios, and team relationships that makes up an organization's work. V2 launched in February 2026 with Streamable HTTP transport, replacing the deprecated V1 beta (SSE, shutdown May 11, 2026).

The server is hosted at `mcp.asana.com/v2/mcp`. No installation, no npm packages, no Docker — connect, authorize via OAuth, and your agent has access to 44 tools spanning the full Asana data model. This is the most tool-rich first-party productivity MCP server we've reviewed, surpassing [Todoist](/reviews/todoist-mcp-server/) (28+ tools) and [Linear](/reviews/linear-mcp-server/) (23+ tools).

## What It Does

The 44 tools cover six functional areas:

**Task management (8 tools):**
- **`asana_create_task`** — Create tasks in a project, workspace, or as subtasks. Requires one of: project_id, parent, or workspace+assignee together.
- **`asana_update_task`** — Modify task properties including status, assignee, due dates, custom fields.
- **`asana_delete_task`** — Remove tasks and associated subtasks.
- **`asana_get_task`** — Full task details: name, description, assignee, due dates, custom fields, projects, dependencies.
- **`asana_get_tasks`** — Query tasks with multiple filtering parameters.
- **`asana_search_tasks`** — Advanced search across text, dates, status, assignee, projects, portfolios, sections, tags, and custom fields.
- **`asana_set_parent_for_task`** — Reorganize task hierarchy relationships.
- **`asana_typeahead_search`** — Quick search across Asana objects by relevance.

**Dependencies and relationships (4 tools):**
- **`asana_set_task_dependencies`** — Establish prerequisite relationships.
- **`asana_set_task_dependents`** — Define blocking relationships in schedules.
- **`asana_add_task_followers`** — Subscribe team members to task notifications.
- **`asana_remove_task_followers`** — Unsubscribe team members from notifications.

**Projects and portfolios (12 tools):**
- **`asana_create_project`** — Set up new projects in a workspace with optional team assignment.
- **`asana_get_project`** — Comprehensive project data and configuration.
- **`asana_get_projects`** — Filter projects by workspace and team.
- **`asana_get_projects_for_team`** — All team projects including archived.
- **`asana_get_projects_for_workspace`** — Entire workspace project inventory.
- **`asana_get_project_sections`** — List organizational sections within projects.
- **`asana_get_project_task_counts`** — Progress statistics for projects.
- **`asana_get_project_status`** — View specific status update.
- **`asana_get_project_statuses`** — Track chronological project health updates.
- **`asana_create_project_status`** — Document project health with color-coded updates.
- **`asana_get_portfolio`** — Access portfolio details.
- **`asana_get_portfolios`** — Discover portfolios filtered by workspace and owner.
- **`asana_get_items_for_portfolio`** — Browse projects and goals within portfolios.

**Goals and time management (7 tools):**
- **`asana_create_goal`** — Establish objectives with name, time period, workspace/team.
- **`asana_get_goal`** — Retrieve detailed goal configuration.
- **`asana_get_goals`** — List goals filtered by portfolio, project, or workspace.
- **`asana_get_parent_goals_for_goal`** — Examine goal hierarchy.
- **`asana_update_goal`** — Modify goal properties including dates and ownership.
- **`asana_update_goal_metric`** — Adjust progress metrics.
- **`asana_get_time_periods`** — Browse available planning periods in workspace.
- **`asana_get_time_period`** — Access time period information for goal planning.

**Team and user management (5 tools):**
- **`asana_list_workspaces`** — Discover accessible workspaces.
- **`asana_get_workspace_users`** — List all workspace members.
- **`asana_get_teams_for_workspace`** — Explore workspace team structure.
- **`asana_get_teams_for_user`** — Check user team membership.
- **`asana_get_team_users`** — Display team member roster.
- **`asana_get_user`** — Retrieve user details by ID, email, or current session.
- **`asana_get_allocations`** — Resource allocation details with date ranges.

**Collaboration (5 tools):**
- **`asana_create_task_story`** — Add comments to tasks.
- **`asana_get_stories_for_task`** — Review task activity history and comments.
- **`asana_get_attachment`** — Access attachment metadata and download information.
- **`asana_get_attachments_for_object`** — List files attached to projects or tasks.

That adds up to roughly 44 tools — the exact count may shift as Asana evolves the server. Asana's documentation deliberately avoids publishing a static list, directing users to the `tools/list` MCP command for the canonical, up-to-date set.

## What Sets It Apart

**Most complete project management MCP server.** 44 tools cover the full Asana hierarchy: workspaces → teams → projects → sections → tasks → subtasks, plus goals, portfolios, time periods, status updates, and allocations. No other productivity MCP server maps this much of its platform's data model. [Todoist](/reviews/todoist-mcp-server/) has 28+ tools but focuses on task management; [Linear](/reviews/linear-mcp-server/) has 23+ tools but is engineering-focused. Asana covers cross-functional project management at enterprise scale.

**Goal and portfolio management.** Seven goal tools and three portfolio tools. No other productivity MCP server offers OKR/goal tracking through MCP. If your organization manages quarterly goals, initiatives, and portfolio-level oversight in Asana, your agent can query progress, create goals, update metrics, and navigate goal hierarchies — all through MCP.

**Hosted zero-install with proper authentication.** `mcp.asana.com/v2/mcp` with OAuth 2.0. No API keys stored on disk, no npm packages to install, no Docker containers to manage. Token scope is MCP-only — if a token is compromised, it only works with the MCP server, not the broader Asana API. Tokens expire after one hour with refresh token support.

**Permission inheritance.** All MCP actions execute with the authenticated user's permissions. The MCP server doesn't grant any access beyond what the user already has — same workspace restrictions, same project visibility, same task-level permissions as the Asana UI. Enterprise+ customers can blocklist specific MCP clients via app management.

**20+ verified client integrations.** Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Kiro, Devin, Microsoft Teams, Figma, Zoom, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, HubSpot, Docker Desktop, Mistral, Make — the broadest client compatibility of any productivity MCP server we've reviewed.

## Setup

Connect your MCP client to the V2 endpoint:

**URL:** `https://mcp.asana.com/v2/mcp`

**Transport:** Streamable HTTP

**Auth:** OAuth 2.0 — you'll be prompted to authorize access to your Asana workspace when you first connect.

For **Claude Desktop** and **ChatGPT**, Asana has native app integrations — search for "Asana" in the respective app stores and enable it. No URL configuration needed.

For **other MCP clients** (Cursor, VS Code, Claude Code, etc.), configure the client to connect to the V2 URL with Streamable HTTP transport and OAuth support. Some clients may require `mcp-remote` bridge if they only support stdio.

**For developers building MCP clients:** Register your app in the Asana developer console to get OAuth credentials. Pre-register your redirect URI. Asana supports PKCE (S256). Dynamic client registration is **not** supported — you must register in advance.

Discovery endpoints:
- OAuth resource metadata: `https://mcp.asana.com/v2/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`
- Authorization server metadata: `https://app.asana.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`

## What's Missing

**V2 dropped tools from V1.** The most significant issue. V1 had ~44 tools; V2 launched with only ~15 and has been expanding. As of March 2026, V2 has rebuilt to ~44 tools, but the transition was rocky. A [forum thread from a Groupon engineer](https://forum.asana.com/t/mcp-v2-comment-story-endpoints-not-exposed-in-tools-list/1126846) reported that V2 initially dropped subtask creation (parent field on create_task), comments/stories, section placement, followers, and dependencies. Some of these have been restored, but the V1 shutdown (May 11, 2026) creates a hard deadline for users on the old server.

**No self-hosted option.** The server is hosted-only at `mcp.asana.com`. If Asana has an outage, your agent loses project management access. No air-gapped deployments, no on-premises installations, no offline capability. This follows the same pattern as [Linear](/reviews/linear-mcp-server/) and [Notion](/reviews/notion-mcp-server/).

**No dynamic client registration.** Unlike some OAuth MCP servers that support automatic client registration, Asana requires pre-registration of MCP apps in the developer console. This adds friction for developers building new MCP clients — you can't just point at the endpoint and start.

**Agent parameter issues.** Forum reports from early adopters describe agents failing to pass required parameters correctly — `opt_fields` and `limit` parameters appearing as null despite explicit instructions. This appears to be worse with smaller/local models. One developer reported having to bypass the MCP server and write their own API wrapper for CrewAI.

**Asana pricing is the real barrier.** The MCP server is free to use, but Asana itself is not. Personal (free) supports up to 10 users with basic features. Starter is $10.99/user/month. Advanced (portfolios, workload, custom automation) is $24.99/user/month. Enterprise and Enterprise+ are custom pricing. Goal tracking requires Business or Enterprise tier. The MCP server amplifies Asana — it doesn't replace the subscription.

**Redirect URI allowlist friction.** Asana maintains an allowlist for OAuth redirect URIs. Some third-party MCP clients may need to contact Asana Support to register their redirect URI before the OAuth flow works. This is a security measure, but it means not every MCP client can connect out of the box.

**No static tool documentation.** Asana's docs say "use the `tools/list` MCP command" rather than publishing a canonical tool list. This makes it harder to evaluate the server before connecting, and means the tool set is effectively a moving target.

## Community Alternatives

The official server isn't the only option:

**roychri/mcp-server-asana** (129 stars, TypeScript, MIT) — The most popular community alternative. 33 tools via npm (`@roychri/mcp-server-asana`). Uses Personal Access Tokens instead of OAuth. Local stdio transport. Includes features the official server doesn't: subtask creation as a dedicated tool, attachment upload/download, project hierarchy queries. Read-only mode via `READ_ONLY_MODE` environment variable. One open issue. Well-documented with Claude Desktop and Claude Code setup instructions.

**n0zer0d4y/asana-project-ops** (2 stars, TypeScript, MIT) — Enhanced fork of roychri's server with batch operations (150-operation batches designed for free tier rate limits), direct section assignment during task creation, complex task hierarchies (50 tasks × 50 subtasks), HTML content validation, and selective tool activation by category. Enterprise-grade but zero community validation.

**adlio/asanamcp** (Rust, Homebrew/cargo) — Rust-based stdio MCP server. Minimal footprint, native binary distribution.

**CDataSoftware/asana-mcp-server-by-cdata** — Read-only access through CData JDBC drivers. Commercial product (CData Connect AI) for full CRUD.

**Why consider community alternatives?** If you need self-hosted deployment, Personal Access Token auth (no OAuth dance), attachment operations, or dedicated subtask tools, roychri/mcp-server-asana fills gaps the official server doesn't. The trade-off: community maintenance, API key on disk, and no guarantee of parity with Asana API changes.

## How It Compares

**vs. [Todoist MCP](/reviews/todoist-mcp-server/) (4/5):** Todoist is better for personal task management — simpler data model, MCP Apps for inline UI, three transport protocols, SDK-first design. Asana is better for cross-functional teams — goals, portfolios, workload allocation, enterprise permissions. Different tools for different scales.

**vs. [Linear MCP](/reviews/linear-mcp-server/) (4/5):** Linear is purpose-built for engineering teams — issues, cycles, projects, initiatives. Asana is broader — it handles engineering, marketing, operations, and cross-functional work. Linear has better tool ergonomics (flat parameter schemas, embedded enums). Asana has more tools and deeper organizational coverage.

**vs. [Atlassian MCP](/reviews/atlassian-mcp-server/) (3.5/5):** Both are enterprise project management servers with hosted OAuth. Asana has more tools (44 vs undocumented) and broader client compatibility. Atlassian covers Jira + Confluence + Compass — if you need knowledge base (Confluence) alongside project management (Jira), Atlassian covers both. Atlassian's community alternative (sooperset/mcp-atlassian, 4,600 stars, 72 tools) is much stronger than Asana's community options.

**vs. [Notion MCP](/reviews/notion-mcp-server/) (3.5/5):** Different categories. Notion is knowledge base + lightweight project management with 18 tools. Asana is deep project management with 44 tools. If your team uses Notion for docs and Asana for project tracking, use both MCP servers.

## The Bottom Line

Asana's official MCP server is the most comprehensive project management MCP server available — 44 tools covering the full work graph from individual tasks to organizational goals. The hosted, OAuth-authenticated design follows best practices: zero-install, permission-aware, MCP-scoped tokens. Twenty-plus verified client integrations make it the most broadly compatible productivity MCP server.

The V1→V2 transition was bumpy (tools dropped, then gradually restored), and the May 2026 V1 shutdown creates urgency for existing users. The lack of self-hosted deployment and dynamic client registration may block some use cases. And the true cost is Asana itself — the MCP server is free, but the platform it unlocks starts at $10.99/user/month with key features gated behind higher tiers.

For teams already using Asana for project management, this is a clear upgrade — your agent can now create tasks, track goals, query portfolios, and manage dependencies without leaving the conversation. For teams evaluating project management MCP servers, the choice comes down to scale: [Todoist](/reviews/todoist-mcp-server/) for personal, [Linear](/reviews/linear-mcp-server/) for engineering teams, Asana for cross-functional enterprise work.

**Rating: 4/5** — The most tool-rich productivity MCP server, with proper hosted architecture and broad client support. The V2 transition stumbles and Asana's own pricing ceiling keep it from 4.5.
