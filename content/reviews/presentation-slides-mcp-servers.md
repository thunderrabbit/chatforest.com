Presentation and slides MCP servers let AI assistants create slide decks, generate PowerPoint files, control Google Slides and Keynote, and build Markdown-based presentations. Instead of manually designing layouts, formatting text, and placing images, you can have AI agents produce complete presentations through the Model Context Protocol.

This review covers the **presentation and slides** vertical — PowerPoint generation, Google Slides integration, Keynote automation, alternative platforms (Canva, Gamma, Slidev), Markdown slide frameworks, and commercial presentation APIs. For document creation more broadly, see our [PDF & Document review](/reviews/pdf-document-mcp-servers/). For design tools, see our [Design & Creative review](/reviews/design-creative-mcp-servers/).

The headline findings: **presenton** (4,300 stars) is a full AI presentation app with built-in MCP support. Among pure MCP servers, **Office-PowerPoint-MCP-Server** (1,300 stars, 32 tools) leads. **trsdn/mcp-server-ppt** offers 204 operations via Windows COM automation. Google Slides is covered through **google_workspace_mcp** (1,400 stars). **Keynote has AppleScript-based MCP support** via easychen/keynote-mcp. **Canva has a semi-official Dev MCP.** No major vendor has released an official presentation-specific MCP server.

## presenton — Full AI Presentation App with MCP

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Platforms |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-----------|
| [presenton](https://github.com/presenton/presenton) | 4,300 | Python + TypeScript | Apache 2.0 | Windows, macOS, Linux |

Not a traditional MCP server — presenton is a **standalone open-source AI presentation generator** (positioned as a Gamma/Beautiful AI alternative) that includes built-in MCP server support. The most popular presentation-related project with MCP integration.

**Multi-LLM support** — works with OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and Ollama (local models). No vendor lock-in. Desktop application with visual editor for generating presentations from prompts and refining them visually. Exports to both PPTX and PDF.

**Trade-offs:** It's a full desktop application, not a lightweight MCP server you'd add to an existing agent setup. Heavier than a standalone MCP server, but much more user-friendly for non-developers.

## PowerPoint / PPTX Generation

### GongRzhe/Office-PowerPoint-MCP-Server (Most Comprehensive)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [Office-PowerPoint-MCP-Server](https://github.com/GongRzhe/Office-PowerPoint-MCP-Server) | 1,300 | Python | — | 34 |

The **most starred and feature-rich presentation MCP server** — version 2.0 organizes 32 tools into 11 specialized modules:

- **Presentation Management** (7 tools) — create, open, save, list slides, get slide info, set slide size, add notes
- **Content Management** (8 tools) — add text, images, shapes, tables, charts with full formatting control
- **Template Operations** (7 tools) — 25 built-in slide templates with dynamic sizing, template search across configurable directories
- **Professional Design** (3 tools) — 4 color schemes (Modern Blue, Corporate Gray, Elegant Green, Warm Red), gradient backgrounds with customizable directions, theme application across presentations
- **Specialized Features** (5 tools) — 9 picture effects, font analysis via FontTools, comprehensive validation with automatic error fixing

Supports 20+ auto shape types, chart types (column, bar, line, pie) with data series management, and advanced table formatting. Built on python-pptx.

### supercurses/powerpoint (The Original)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [powerpoint](https://github.com/supercurses/powerpoint) | 144 | Python | MIT | 10 |

The **original PowerPoint MCP server** that launched the category — 10 tools for complete presentation creation:

- **create-presentation** — initialize a new presentation
- **add-slide-title-only** / **add-slide-section-header** / **add-slide-title-content** — different slide layouts
- **add-slide-title-with-table** — dynamically generated tables
- **add-slide-title-with-chart** — auto-formatted charts
- **add-slide-picture-with-caption** — images with AI-generated visuals via TogetherAI API
- **open-presentation** / **save-presentation** — edit existing PPTX files

Requires a TogetherAI API key for image generation. Clean, focused design — does one thing well.

### Ichigo3766/powerpoint-mcp (Stable Diffusion Fork)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [powerpoint-mcp](https://github.com/Ichigo3766/powerpoint-mcp) | 51 | Python | MIT | 10 |

Fork of supercurses/powerpoint with **local image generation** — replaces TogetherAI with Stable Diffusion via ForgeUI/Automatic-1111 API. Same 10 tools plus a `generate-and-save-image` tool. Useful if you want image generation without cloud API costs.

### ltc6539/mcp-ppt (SVG Integration)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [mcp-ppt](https://github.com/ltc6539/mcp-ppt) | 65 | Python | — | 14 |

Takes a different approach with **SVG graphics integration** — generates SVG elements and auto-converts to PNG for embedding in slides:

- 6 slide types — title, content, section, image, table
- Unique presentation ID tracking for multi-deck workflows
- Outline generation and metadata retrieval
- Base64 export for programmatic consumption
- Slide removal and reordering

Good for workflows where you need vector graphics or diagram-heavy presentations.

### socamalo/PPT_MCP_Server (Live PowerPoint Control)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [PPT_MCP_Server](https://github.com/socamalo/PPT_MCP_Server) | 42 | Python | MIT | ~8 |

The **only server that controls a live PowerPoint application** — uses Windows COM API via pywin32 to interact with Microsoft PowerPoint directly:

- Create, open, save, close presentations
- Add slides with different layouts
- Insert text boxes and update content
- Set slide titles

**Windows-only** with PowerPoint installed. Best for scenarios where you need to manipulate an existing PowerPoint instance rather than generate PPTX files programmatically.

### trsdn/mcp-server-ppt (Most Operations)

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| [mcp-server-ppt](https://github.com/trsdn/mcp-server-ppt) | Community | Python | 33 tools, 204 operations |

The **most operation-rich presentation MCP server** — 33 tools with 204 individual operations that control the actual PowerPoint application through Windows COM automation. Covers slides, shapes, text, charts, tables, animations, transitions, and VBA macros.

Like socamalo's server, this requires Windows with Office installed. The key difference is scale: 204 operations vs ~8 tools. If you need to manipulate every aspect of a PowerPoint presentation, this is the most comprehensive option — but it's also the most complex to set up.

## Google Slides

Google Slides doesn't have a high-adoption dedicated MCP server. The most common way to access Slides via MCP is through **Google Workspace MCP servers** like [taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp](https://github.com/taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp) (1,400 stars), which includes Slides alongside Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and more. For a dedicated Slides-only server:

### matteoantoci/google-slides-mcp (Dedicated)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [google-slides-mcp](https://github.com/matteoantoci/google-slides-mcp) | 9 | TypeScript | GPL-3.0 | 5 |

A **dedicated Google Slides MCP server** — full API access with OAuth 2.0 authentication:

- **create_presentation** — new slide decks with custom titles
- **get_presentation** — retrieve metadata and content
- **batch_update_presentation** — apply multiple modifications (text, shapes, images, new slides)
- **get_page** — individual slide details
- **summarize_presentation** — extract all text content, optionally including speaker notes

Requires Google Cloud Project credentials with OAuth 2.0 Client ID/Secret. Node.js v18+. Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and VSCode via Cline.

## Markdown-Based Slides

### masaki39/marp-mcp (Marp Ecosystem)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [marp-mcp](https://github.com/masaki39/marp-mcp) | 5 | TypeScript | MIT | 5 |

Integrates with the **Marp Markdown presentation ecosystem** (10,600 stars on the main Marp repo) — create professional slides from Markdown:

- **list_layouts** — display available slide layouts with parameters
- **generate_slide_ids** — create identifiers for all slides
- **manage_slide** — insert, replace, delete operations
- **set_frontmatter** — YAML frontmatter configuration
- **read_slide** — retrieve content by ID or list all

4 themes (default, Gaia, Uncover, Academic) and 5 style presets (rich, minimal, dark, corporate, academic). Includes Claude Code skill integration via `/marp` command. Best for developers who prefer code-first presentation workflows.

### bsmnyk/mdslides-mcp-server (Reveal.js)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [mdslides-mcp-server](https://github.com/bsmnyk/mdslides-mcp-server) | 6 | Python | MIT | ~3 |

Generates **Reveal.js HTML presentations** from Markdown content:

- 12 visual themes — black, white, league, beige, night, serif, simple, solarized, moon, dracula, sky, blood
- Configurable code syntax highlighting via highlight.js
- Reveal.js customization options
- Docker containerization support
- Clean temporary file handling

Uses the mkslides library under the hood. Good for web-based presentations and developer talks with code samples.

## Commercial / SaaS

### SlideSpeak/slidespeak-mcp (API-Powered)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [slidespeak-mcp](https://github.com/SlideSpeak/slidespeak-mcp) | 12 | Python | — | ~3 |

Connects to the **SlideSpeak API** for professional presentation generation:

- API-based PowerPoint creation from text, documents, or structured data
- Customizable parameters (length, tone, style)
- Multiple deployment options — Docker, Node.js, direct Python
- Professional templates and polished output

Requires a SlideSpeak API key. Best for teams wanting high-quality output without managing local tooling or python-pptx complexity.

## Keynote

### easychen/keynote-mcp (AppleScript Automation)

| Server | Stars | Language | Platform |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| [keynote-mcp](https://github.com/easychen/keynote-mcp) | 34 | Python | macOS only |

The primary Keynote MCP server — uses **AppleScript to control the Keynote application** directly:

- Create, open, save presentations
- Add slides with text, images, shapes, tables, charts
- Export to PDF and images
- Built-in **Unsplash image search** for adding relevant photos

**macOS-only** with Keynote installed. AppleScript automation can be fragile across macOS updates. An enhanced fork at [betancur/keynote-mcp](https://github.com/betancur/keynote-mcp) adds modular architecture and theme-aware content management.

## Alternative Platforms

### Canva (Semi-Official)

Canva has a **semi-official Dev MCP Server** documented at [canva.dev/docs/apps/mcp-server](https://www.canva.dev/docs/apps/mcp-server/) — the closest thing to an official vendor MCP offering in the presentation space. It's designed for building Canva app integrations rather than directly creating presentations, but it opens the door to programmatic Canva access. Several community servers also exist for managing designs, brands, and assets.

### Gamma (AI Presentation Platform)

Three community MCP servers connect to **Gamma's API** for AI-powered presentation generation: [nickloveinvesting/gamma-mcpserver](https://github.com/nickloveinvesting/gamma-mcpserver), [Purple-Horizons/gamma-mcp](https://github.com/Purple-Horizons/gamma-mcp), and [CryptoJym/gamma-mcp-server](https://github.com/CryptoJym/gamma-mcp-server). All are low-adoption but functional for Gamma users.

### Slidev (Developer Presentations)

[LSTM-Kirigaya/slidev-mcp](https://github.com/LSTM-Kirigaya/slidev-mcp) — MCP server for **Slidev**, the Vue.js-based developer presentation framework. Auto-generates web presentations from natural language descriptions. Niche but useful for developers who prefer code-based slides.

## What's missing

Remaining gaps in the ecosystem:

- **No Figma Slides** — Figma's presentation features have no MCP representation
- **No Prezi** — dynamic, zooming presentations have no MCP coverage
- **No collaborative editing** — real-time co-authoring and commenting workflows
- **No template marketplaces** — Envato, SlidesCarnival, and other template sources
- **No presentation analytics** — view tracking, engagement metrics, audience feedback
- **No slide-to-video conversion** — turning presentations into video content
- **No accessibility checking** — WCAG compliance validation for presentations
- **No brand compliance** — enforcing corporate style guides and brand assets
- **No presenter tools** — teleprompter, timer, audience Q&A, live polling
- **No official vendor servers** — Microsoft, Google, and Apple have not released official presentation-specific MCP servers despite the clear demand

## The bottom line

Presentation MCP servers earn **3.5 out of 5**. presenton (4,300 stars) proves the demand with a full AI presentation app. PowerPoint generation is genuinely strong — the 1,300-star Office-PowerPoint-MCP-Server offers 32 tools with professional design features, and trsdn's COM server provides 204 operations for complete PowerPoint control. Google Slides has coverage through Workspace servers. Keynote, Canva, Gamma, and Slidev all have at least basic MCP support.

But no major vendor has released an official presentation-specific MCP server despite clear community demand. The ecosystem is heavily skewed toward creating PPTX files from scratch. The broader presentation lifecycle — design iteration, collaboration, delivery, audience engagement, and analytics — has minimal MCP representation. If you need to generate slide decks programmatically, the tooling is ready. If you need to manage the full lifecycle of professional presentations, you're still doing most of the work manually.
