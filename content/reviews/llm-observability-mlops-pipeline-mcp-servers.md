card_description: "LLM observability and MLOps pipeline MCP servers across observability platforms, distributed tracing, prompt management, pipeline orchestration, and experiment tracking. The standout is comet-ml/opik-mcp (200 stars, TypeScript, Apache 2.0) — an MCP implementation for the open-source Opik platform enabling seamless IDE integration with unified access to prompts, projects, traces, and metrics. It ships toolsets including core, integration, expert-prompts, expert-datasets, expert-trace-actions, expert-project-actions, and metrics — supporting both local stdio and remote streamable-http transports. v2.0.1 (March 2026) is the latest release across 160 commits. traceloop/opentelemetry-mcp-server (175 stars, Python, Apache 2.0) is a unified MCP server for querying OpenTelemetry traces across multiple backends — Jaeger, Grafana Tempo, and Traceloop. 10 tools including search_traces, search_spans, get_trace, find_errors, get_llm_usage, list_llm_models, get_llm_model_stats, get_llm_expensive_traces, and get_llm_slow_traces. Specialized LLM observability through OpenLLMetry semantic conventions. langfuse/mcp-server-langfuse (158 stars, TypeScript, MIT) provides prompt management via the MCP Prompts specification — list and retrieve prompts with variable compilation, create text and chat prompts, and update labels. Built directly into Langfuse at /api/public/mcp (streamableHttp) with zero external setup. langchain-ai/langsmith-mcp-server (89 stars, Python, MIT) is a production-ready MCP server for the LangSmith observability platform — fetch conversation history, prompts, runs/traces, datasets, experiments, and billing usage. 15+ tools covering thread history, prompt CRUD, run fetching, dataset management, and experiment execution. zenml-io/mcp-zenml (43 stars, Python) brings ML pipeline orchestration to AI assistants — query pipelines, analyze runs, trigger deployments, manage projects/tags/builds, inspect snapshots and deployments with bounded log retrieval. 30+ tools across pipeline execution, organization, core entities, and experimental interactive dashboard apps. wandb/wandb-mcp-server (41 stars, Python) provides official W&B integration with 6 tools for querying experiments, analyzing Weave traces, creating reports, and accessing W&B documentation. Helicone MCP (TypeScript) enables querying the Helicone LLM observability platform — request filtering/pagination and session querying — plus LLM routing through the Helicone AI Gateway supporting 100+ models. comet-ml/comet-mcp (1 star, Python, Apache 2.0) provides 10 tools for interacting with Comet ML experiments including listing, filtering, code retrieval, metric comparison, and built-in OpenTelemetry instrumentation. Gaps: no unified observability-to-pipeline server (you need separate MCP servers for tracing, prompts, and pipeline management), no cost analytics across providers, no automated alerting or anomaly detection via MCP, prompt management servers don't version-control prompts through Git, pipeline MCP servers can trigger runs but can't monitor them in real-time, no A/B test management for model deployments. Rating: 3.5/5."

LLM observability and MLOps pipeline MCP servers address the operational layer of AI development — once you've built your models and agents, how do you **monitor** their behavior, **manage** your prompts, **orchestrate** training pipelines, and **analyze** experiment results? These servers bring that operational data into your AI assistant, so you can debug a failing trace, query experiment metrics, or trigger a pipeline run through natural language instead of switching between dashboards.

This is a distinct concern from model serving and inference (covered in our [AI/ML Model Serving review](/reviews/ai-ml-model-serving-mcp-servers/)). Where that review covers running models, this one covers **watching them run** — traces, metrics, prompts, pipelines, and experiments. For evaluation and benchmarking frameworks, see our [LLM Evaluation & Benchmarking review](/reviews/llm-evaluation-benchmarking-mcp-servers/). For agent coordination, see our [Agent Orchestration review](/reviews/agent-orchestration-mcp-servers/).

## LLM Observability Platforms (3 servers)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Key Feature |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| [comet-ml/opik-mcp](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik-mcp) | 200 | TypeScript | Apache 2.0 | Unified LLM observability — prompts, traces, metrics |
| [langchain-ai/langsmith-mcp-server](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langsmith-mcp-server) | 89 | Python | MIT | Full LangChain ecosystem observability |
| Helicone MCP | — | TypeScript | — | LLM gateway + observability querying |

**Opik MCP** (200 stars) is the most feature-rich observability MCP server. Built by the Comet team, it provides unified access to the open-source Opik platform through modular toolsets: **core** (basic operations), **integration** (cross-tool connections), **expert-prompts** (prompt management), **expert-datasets** (dataset operations), **expert-trace-actions** (trace analysis), **expert-project-actions** (project management), and **metrics** (performance data). You can enable all toolsets at once or cherry-pick what you need. Supports both local stdio and remote streamable-http transports for flexible deployment. v2.0.1 (March 2026) represents active development across 160 commits. The modular architecture is smart — it avoids bloating the tool list for agents that only need trace analysis.

**LangSmith MCP** (89 stars) is the official MCP server from the LangChain team. If you're already building with LangChain or LangGraph, this is the natural choice. 15+ tools cover conversation thread history (`get_thread_history`), prompt management (`list_prompts`, `get_prompt_by_name`, `push_prompt`), trace and run analysis (`fetch_runs`, `list_projects`), dataset management (`list_datasets`, `list_examples`, `read_dataset`, `read_example`, `create_dataset`, `update_examples`), experiment execution (`list_experiments`, `run_experiment`), and billing usage (`get_billing_usage`). The billing tool is a nice touch — cost visibility directly from your AI assistant. Production-ready with Python 3.10+ support (3.11+ recommended). The trade-off: deeply integrated with the LangChain ecosystem, less useful if you use other frameworks.

**Helicone MCP** provides a different angle — it's both an observability query tool and an LLM proxy. Two tools: `query_requests` (search request logs with filters, pagination, sorting, and optional body content) and `query_sessions` (search sessions with time range filtering). But the gateway feature is distinctive: route LLM requests through Helicone's AI Gateway with automatic logging, supporting 100+ models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more in OpenAI SDK format. This means your AI assistant can both **make** LLM calls and **analyze** past calls through the same MCP server. Available via `npx @helicone/mcp@latest`.

## Distributed Tracing & Debugging (1 server)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools | Key Feature |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| [traceloop/opentelemetry-mcp-server](https://github.com/traceloop/opentelemetry-mcp-server) | 175 | Python | Apache 2.0 | 10 | Cross-backend OTel trace querying |

**OpenTelemetry MCP Server** (175 stars) is the only MCP server that provides a **vendor-neutral** view into your distributed traces. It connects to three backends — **Jaeger**, **Grafana Tempo**, and **Traceloop** — through a unified interface. Ten tools cover the essential debugging workflow: `search_traces` and `search_spans` for finding relevant data, `get_trace` for complete trace details, `find_errors` for error discovery, and a suite of LLM-specific tools: `get_llm_usage` (aggregate token metrics), `list_llm_models` (model discovery), `get_llm_model_stats` (performance statistics), `get_llm_expensive_traces` (highest token usage), and `get_llm_slow_traces` (latency outliers). The LLM-specific tools use OpenLLMetry semantic conventions, making this particularly valuable for AI teams running production LLM applications. Requires Python 3.11+, distributed via PyPI as `opentelemetry-mcp`. The vendor-neutral approach is the key differentiator — if you're already using OpenTelemetry for your infrastructure, this server brings your AI traces into the same observability stack.

## Prompt Management (1 server)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools | Key Feature |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| [langfuse/mcp-server-langfuse](https://github.com/langfuse/mcp-server-langfuse) | 158 | TypeScript | MIT | 4 | MCP Prompts specification + hosted server |

**Langfuse MCP** (158 stars) focuses specifically on prompt management through the MCP Prompts specification. Four tools: `prompts/list` (enumerate available prompts with pagination), `prompts/get` (retrieve and compile prompts with variables), `get-prompts` (list with cursor-based pagination), and `get-prompt` (fetch individual prompts with arguments). Additionally supports `createTextPrompt`, `createChatPrompt`, and `updatePromptLabels` for prompt authoring. The standout feature: it's **built directly into Langfuse** at `/api/public/mcp` using streamableHttp transport — no separate server to deploy or maintain. Just point your MCP client at your Langfuse instance. Currently limited to production-labeled prompts only, and list operations fetch each prompt individually in the background. Part of the broader Langfuse platform (23K+ GitHub stars, MIT license) which handles full LLM observability including tracing, evaluation, and datasets — but the MCP server currently focuses on the prompt management surface.

## ML Pipeline Orchestration (1 server)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Key Feature |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| [zenml-io/mcp-zenml](https://github.com/zenml-io/mcp-zenml) | 43 | Python | — | Natural language pipeline queries and deployment triggers |

**ZenML MCP** (43 stars) is the only server that brings full ML pipeline orchestration to AI assistants. 30+ tools span the complete ZenML lifecycle: **pipeline execution** (`get_snapshot`, `list_snapshots`, `get_deployment`, `list_deployments`, `get_deployment_logs`, `trigger_pipeline`), **organization** (`get_active_project`, `list_projects`, `list_tags`, `list_builds`), and **core entity management** for users, stacks, components, flavors, connectors, pipeline runs, run steps, artifacts, secrets, services, models, and model versions. Experimental interactive apps include `open_pipeline_run_dashboard` and `open_run_activity_chart` — HTML UIs served directly into MCP clients. The value proposition: "Which pipeline runs failed this week and why?" or "Trigger the latest fraud detection pipeline with production data" — without leaving your IDE. ZenML itself (5.3K stars, Apache 2.0) integrates with MLflow, W&B, Kubeflow, SageMaker, and Vertex AI, so the MCP server gives you a natural language interface to your entire ML infrastructure stack.

## Experiment Tracking (3 servers)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools | Key Feature |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| [wandb/wandb-mcp-server](https://github.com/wandb/wandb-mcp-server) | 41 | Python | — | 6 | Official W&B with report generation |
| [kkruglik/mlflow-mcp](https://github.com/kkruglik/mlflow-mcp) | 3 | Python | MIT | 17+ | Comprehensive MLflow API coverage |
| [comet-ml/comet-mcp](https://github.com/comet-ml/comet-mcp) | 1 | Python | Apache 2.0 | 10 | Comet ML experiments + OTel instrumentation |

**W&B MCP** (41 stars, official) and **MLflow MCP** (3 stars) are covered in detail in our [AI/ML Model Serving review](/reviews/ai-ml-model-serving-mcp-servers/). In brief: W&B's server provides 6 tools with automated report generation being the standout feature, while MLflow MCP covers 17+ tools across the entire MLflow API surface — experiments, runs, metrics, artifacts, and model registry.

**Comet MCP** (1 star) is the newest entry — the official Comet ML experiment tracking server. Ten tools: `list_experiments` (filter and retrieve recent experiments), `get_experiment_details` (comprehensive metadata), `get_experiment_code` (source code extraction), `get_experiment_output` (training logs and stderr), `get_experiment_metric_data` (metrics across multiple experiments), `get_default_workspace`, `list_projects`, `list_project_experiments`, `count_project_experiments`, and `get_session_info`. The distinguishing feature is **built-in OpenTelemetry instrumentation** — every tool call generates distributed traces for debugging the MCP server itself, with support for both file-based and cloud-based (Opik) telemetry export. Low star count likely reflects recent release rather than quality — the tool coverage is thorough and the OTel integration is a smart architectural choice.

## The Big Picture

LLM observability and MLOps pipeline MCP servers are still in their **early days**. The total star count across all servers in this category is modest compared to database or web scraping MCP servers, reflecting that most teams haven't yet connected their operational tooling to AI assistants.

**Best in class:** Opik MCP (200 stars, modular toolsets, active development) and OpenTelemetry MCP (175 stars, vendor-neutral tracing) are the strongest standalone servers. LangSmith MCP (89 stars) wins if you're already in the LangChain ecosystem.

**Most practical for teams already using the platform:** Each server here is tightly coupled to its parent platform (Langfuse, LangSmith, W&B, Comet, ZenML). Choose based on what you already run, not the MCP server's star count.

**Unique value:** ZenML MCP is the only server that can actually **trigger** ML pipeline runs, not just query data. The OpenTelemetry MCP server is the only one offering vendor-neutral observability. Helicone uniquely combines observability querying with LLM request routing.

**Key gaps:** No unified server bridges observability, prompt management, and pipeline orchestration — you need 2-3 separate MCP servers for a complete workflow. No cost analytics across LLM providers. No automated alerting or anomaly detection through MCP. Prompt management servers don't version-control prompts through Git. Pipeline servers can trigger runs but can't stream real-time training progress. No A/B test management for model deployments.

**Rating: 3.5/5** — Strong individual servers from established platforms (Opik, LangSmith, Langfuse, ZenML), with the OpenTelemetry MCP server providing a genuinely novel vendor-neutral approach. But the category is fragmented — each server is an island connecting to its own platform, with no cross-platform integration. Adoption is still low relative to other MCP categories, and the gap between "query historical data" and "actively manage production AI systems" remains wide.
