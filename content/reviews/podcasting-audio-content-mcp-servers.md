card_description: "Podcasting and audio content MCP servers for AI-powered audio production, speech synthesis, transcription, music generation, and DAW control. **ElevenLabs dominates the audio ecosystem** — elevenlabs/elevenlabs-mcp (1,100 stars, Python) is the official ElevenLabs MCP server providing the most comprehensive audio AI platform access. It covers text-to-speech generation with fine-grained control over stability, style, and similarity settings, voice cloning from audio samples or text descriptions of desired characteristics, audio isolation (separating speech from background noise), voice conversion (making audio sound like different voices), speech-to-text transcription with speaker identification, sound effects generation from text descriptions, and ambient soundscape creation. Free tier includes 10,000 credits/month. Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and OpenAI Agents. For local TTS without cloud dependencies, **multiple free options exist** — hammeiam/koroko-speech-mcp (MIT, TypeScript) uses the Kokoro TTS model with no API key required, multiple voice options, and customizable speed. digitarald/chatterbox-mcp wraps the Chatterbox TTS model (by Resemble AI) with automatic playback and progress notifications. SmartLittleApps/local-tts-mcp provides dual engines (macOS Say + Kokoro TTS) for offline speech synthesis. **blacktop/mcp-tts is the Swiss Army knife** — supports 4 TTS backends: macOS built-in say command, ElevenLabs API, Google Gemini TTS (30 high-quality voices), and OpenAI TTS API. Sequential speech queuing prevents overlapping audio. Good for comparing providers. **Microsoft Edge TTS servers offer free cloud TTS** — yuiseki/edge_tts_mcp_server (5 stars, TypeScript) and eraincc/edge-tts-mcp (Python) both leverage Microsoft Edge's online TTS service without needing an API key. Hundreds of voices across 40+ languages. **MiniMax is a multi-modal powerhouse** — MiniMax-AI/MiniMax-MCP (421 stars, Python, official) combines TTS, voice cloning, music generation (music-1.5 model), image generation, and video generation in one server. The only MCP server covering this many audio+visual modalities. **Speech-to-text has strong local options** — SmartLittleApps/local-stt-mcp uses whisper.cpp optimized for Apple Silicon with 15x+ real-time transcription speed, speaker diarization, and universal audio format support. 100% local with no cloud APIs. ebmarquez/audio-transcription-mcp combines Faster-Whisper with pyannote.audio for speaker diarization, outputting markdown with speaker labels, timestamps, summaries, and action items. Dockerized for CPU/GPU deployment. arcaputo3/mcp-server-whisper (MIT, Python) provides OpenAI Whisper + GPT-4o enhanced transcription with parallel batch processing, automatic compression for files over 25MB, and multiple transcription modes. **Kvadratni/speech-mcp is the most complete voice interface** (~80 stars, Python) — a Goose MCP extension providing bidirectional voice interaction with audio visualization. Uses Faster-Whisper for speech recognition (local, no cloud) and Kokoro TTS with 54+ voice models for synthesis. Features silence detection, voice persistence, continuous conversation, and robust error handling. The only server offering a complete conversational voice loop. **REAPER DAW gets exceptional MCP coverage** — shiehn/total-reaper-mcp (27 stars) provides 100% ReaScript API coverage with tool profiles: default dsl-production (53 tools), minimal (15 tools), traditional ReaScript (146 tools), and full (600+ tools). TwelveTake-Studios/reaper-mcp is built by a working producer with 7+ albums for mixing, mastering, MIDI composition, and full production workflows. Aavishkar-Kolte/reaper-daw-mcp-server is an intelligent music production assistant. itsuzef/reaper-mcp supports both OSC and ReaScript modes for MIDI and audio capabilities. dschuler36/reaper-mcp-server enables comprehensive audio analysis for mixing feedback. **Music generation from text prompts is emerging** — pasie15/mcp-server-musicgpt provides 24 tools including music generation from text, cover song creation, sound effects, lyrics generation, voice conversion, mastering, and remixing via the MusicGPT API. falahgs/mcp-minimax-music-server uses the MiniMax Music API for high-quality music creation. tubone24/midi-mcp-server generates MIDI files from structured data with multi-track and multi-instrument support. williamzujkowski/strudel-mcp-server enables AI-assisted live coding and algorithmic composition through Strudel.cc. **Podcast feed consumption is covered by RSS MCP servers** — veithly/rss-mcp (TypeScript, RSS/Atom/RSSHub), richardwooding/feed-mcp (RSS/Atom/JSON feeds), hmmroger/simply-feed-mcp (real-time feed management), imprvhub/mcp-rss-aggregator (Claude Desktop integration), and several more. These work for consuming podcast feeds but lack podcast-specific features. **Spotify integration provides listening/playback** — 5+ Spotify MCP servers (varunneal/spotify-mcp, marcelmarais/spotify-mcp-server, Carrieukie/spotify-mcp-server, etc.) enable playback control, search, and playlist management. Useful for podcast listening workflows but not production. **Azure provides enterprise-grade speech** — the Azure MCP Server includes speech-to-text and text-to-speech tools through Microsoft's Foundry platform, supporting WAV, MP3, OPUS, FLAC, and more. Requires Azure subscription. **Major gaps remain in podcast-specific tooling** — no podcast hosting platform APIs (Spotify for Podcasters, Apple Podcasts Connect, Anchor, Buzzsprout, Podbean, Libsyn), no episode scheduling or publishing workflows, no podcast analytics or listener metrics, no show notes generation, no transcript editing (the transcription servers produce output but don't support editing workflows), no audio mastering pipelines (individual tools exist but no end-to-end workflow), no podcast distribution to multiple platforms, no audiogram or waveform video generation, no chapter markers or enhanced podcasting features, no dynamic ad insertion. The category earns 4/5 — the building blocks for audio production are genuinely strong. ElevenLabs provides a professional-grade audio AI platform. Local TTS and STT options mean you can do real work without cloud costs. REAPER DAW coverage is exceptional with 600+ tools. Music generation is emerging but functional. The main weakness is the gap between having individual audio tools and having podcast-specific workflows — there's no server that helps you record, edit, transcribe, write show notes, add chapters, publish to platforms, and track analytics for a podcast. You'd need to chain multiple servers together and build the workflow yourself."

Podcasting and audio content MCP servers let AI assistants produce speech, transcribe audio, generate music, control DAWs, clone voices, and create sound effects. Instead of manually juggling audio editors, transcription services, and TTS APIs, you can wire these capabilities directly into your AI workflow through the Model Context Protocol.

This review covers the **podcasting and audio content** vertical — text-to-speech, speech-to-text transcription, music generation, DAW control, voice interaction, and podcast feed management. For video production, see our [Video & Streaming review](/reviews/video-streaming-mcp-servers/). For general content creation, see our [Content & Copywriting review](/reviews/content-copywriting-mcp-servers/).

The headline findings: **ElevenLabs has 1,100 stars** and is the most comprehensive audio MCP server — TTS, voice cloning, transcription, and sound effects in one package. **REAPER DAW has 600+ tools** available through total-reaper-mcp. **Local TTS and STT are genuinely viable** — Kokoro, Chatterbox, and whisper.cpp mean zero cloud costs. **Podcast-specific workflows are the gap** — individual audio tools are strong, but no server handles the full podcast lifecycle.

## Podcast Feed Management

Several RSS/Atom MCP servers handle podcast feed consumption:

| Server | Language | Focus |
|--------|----------|-------|
| [veithly/rss-mcp](https://github.com/veithly/rss-mcp) | TypeScript | RSS/Atom/RSSHub feeds — most versatile |
| [richardwooding/feed-mcp](https://github.com/richardwooding/feed-mcp) | — | RSS, Atom, and JSON Feed support |
| [hmmroger/simply-feed-mcp](https://github.com/hmmroger/simply-feed-mcp) | — | Real-time feed management and search |
| [imprvhub/mcp-rss-aggregator](https://github.com/imprvhub/mcp-rss-aggregator) | — | Claude Desktop feed aggregation |
| [S1R15H/blog-mcp-server](https://github.com/S1R15H/blog-mcp-server) | — | Blog RSS/Atom with post search |

These work for **consuming** podcast RSS feeds — listing episodes, fetching descriptions, and searching content. They lack podcast-specific features like episode metadata enrichment, transcript pairing, or show notes extraction.

## Streaming Platform Integration

Multiple Spotify MCP servers exist for playback and playlist control:

| Server | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| [varunneal/spotify-mcp](https://github.com/varunneal/spotify-mcp) | Claude + Spotify via spotipy API |
| [marcelmarais/spotify-mcp-server](https://github.com/marcelmarais/spotify-mcp-server) | Lightweight — Cursor & Claude playback control |
| [Carrieukie/spotify-mcp-server](https://github.com/Carrieukie/spotify-mcp-server) | Kotlin — natural language access to Spotify Web API |

Useful for **podcast listening workflows** — search for podcasts, control playback, manage playlists. Not production tools.

## What's missing

The audio production building blocks are strong, but **podcast-specific workflows** are the clear gap:

- **No podcast hosting integrations** — Spotify for Podcasters, Apple Podcasts Connect, Anchor, Buzzsprout, Podbean, Libsyn have no MCP servers
- **No episode scheduling/publishing** — no server can publish an episode to a hosting platform
- **No podcast analytics** — listener metrics, download stats, demographic data
- **No show notes generation** — transcription exists but automated show notes from transcripts doesn't
- **No transcript editing** — servers produce transcripts but don't support edit/review workflows
- **No audio mastering pipeline** — individual tools exist but no end-to-end podcast mastering workflow
- **No podcast distribution** — no multi-platform publishing (push to Apple, Spotify, Google simultaneously)
- **No audiogram generation** — waveform videos for social media promotion
- **No chapter markers** — enhanced podcasting features like chapters, links, images
- **No dynamic ad insertion** — programmatic ad placement in episodes
- **No Ableton/Logic/FL Studio** — REAPER is the only DAW with MCP coverage

## The bottom line

Podcasting and audio content MCP servers earn **4 out of 5**. The building blocks are genuinely strong — ElevenLabs provides a professional-grade audio AI platform with 1,100 stars and comprehensive TTS, voice cloning, transcription, and sound effects. Local options (Kokoro, Chatterbox, whisper.cpp) mean you can do real audio work without cloud costs. REAPER DAW coverage is exceptional with 600+ tools across multiple servers. Music generation is emerging with text-to-music, MIDI creation, and live coding tools.

The weakness is the gap between having individual audio tools and having podcast-specific workflows. You can transcribe audio, generate speech, make music, and mix in REAPER — but no server helps you record, edit, write show notes, add chapters, publish to hosting platforms, distribute across directories, and track listener analytics. You'd need to chain multiple servers together and build the podcast workflow yourself. For audio production broadly, the ecosystem is ready. For podcast production specifically, you're still assembling the pipeline manually.
