Requires Node.js 22+. Registered via Claude CLI for HTTP transport. **Advanced Ansible operations** — bsahane/mcp-ansible (25 stars, Python) exposes comprehensive Ansible utilities: playbook creation/validation/execution, ad-hoc task execution, role scaffolding, inventory parsing with ansible.cfg awareness, group/host graph visualization, host variable resolution, connectivity testing, vault operations. Advanced troubleshooting suite includes remote command execution, log analysis, service management, host health diagnostics with scoring, system baseline comparison, automated problem detection, network connectivity matrix testing, and security vulnerability assessments. **Enterprise Red Hat ecosystem** — sibilleb/AAP-Enterprise-MCP-Server (24 stars, Python) provides 47+ tools across five domains: 17+ AAP management tools (inventory, jobs, projects, templates, hosts), 9 ansible-lint quality assurance tools (progressive quality profiles, project-wide analysis), 8 Event-Driven Ansible tools (activation lifecycle, rulebook management), 5 Galaxy discovery tools (collection/role search with AI-powered suggestions), and 8 Red Hat documentation tools (domain-validated official sources with PDF-first strategy). **Multi-tool infrastructure operator** — tarnover/mcp-sysoperator (26 stars, TypeScript, MIT) combines Ansible, Terraform, LocalStack, and AWS resource management in a single MCP server. Execute playbooks with parameter support, validate syntax, manage Terraform operations (init/plan/apply/destroy), and interact with AWS resources (EC2, S3, VPC, CloudFormation). Includes LocalStack integration for local testing without credentials. Active development, not recommended for production. **Lightweight AAP integration** — mancubus77/mcp-server-aap (3 stars, Python) is a minimal MCP server for launching Ansible job templates via the AAP API. Template discovery, job launching with custom variables, status monitoring, output retrieval, and connection testing with exponential backoff retry logic. **Ansible Collection for MCP** — ansible-collections/ansible.mcp (1 star, Python, GPL-3.0) is the official Ansible Collection providing MCP plugins, installable via ansible-galaxy. Active development with 88 commits. **MCP server installer for Execution Environments** — redhat-cop/ansible.mcp_builder (1 star, Shell, GPL-3.0) automates installation of MCP servers (AWS, Azure, GitHub) into Ansible Execution Environments via npm, PyPI, or compiled Go binaries. Registry system with automatic manifest generation. Compatible with ansible-builder 3.x. **Nix framework for MCP servers** — natsukium/mcp-servers-nix (215 stars, Nix, Apache-2.0) provides a modular Nix-based configuration framework with 25 pre-configured MCP server modules. Reproducible builds, security-focused credential handling via envFile and passwordCommand, integration with Flakes, flake-parts, devenv, and Home Manager. **Declarative MCP configuration** — aloshy-ai/nix-mcp-servers (23 stars, Nix, MIT) is a Nix flake for declaratively configuring MCP servers for Claude Desktop and Cursor. Cross-platform support for NixOS, Darwin, and Home Manager. CLI tool available via nix run. **SaltStack minion management** — Bearbobs/saltstack-mcp (0 stars, Python, MIT) provides basic Salt API integration with four tools: list_all_minions, ping_minions, get_minion_info, and execute_salt_command. Docker deployment with credential management. Minimal but functional for salt-master interaction. **Consul service discovery** — kocierik/consul-mcp-server (16 stars, TypeScript, MIT) provides access to HashiCorp Consul's functionality: service management (list/register/deregister), health checks, key-value store operations (get/list/put/delete), session management, event handling, prepared queries, cluster status (leader/peers), and agent operations. Installable via npx or Smithery. **Homelab infrastructure** — bjeans/homelab-mcp (18 stars, Python, MIT) bundles 7 MCP servers for homelab management including Ansible inventory integration. 39 total tools with MCP annotations. Docker/Podman containers, Ollama models, Pi-hole DNS, Unifi networks, UPS monitoring, and Ansible-managed host querying. v3.0.0 with FastMCP framework. **Ansible + Terraform combo** — washyu/ansible-mcp-server (6 stars, JavaScript, MIT) provided 58 infrastructure management tools spanning Ansible operations, hardware scanning, security assessments, and service deployment. Archived October 2025 — read-only but still functional as reference. **Gaps remain in several areas** — no Puppet MCP server exists despite Puppet being a major configuration management tool. No Chef Infra or Chef InSpec MCP servers. No CFEngine, mgmt, or Bcfg2 MCP integration. No unified configuration management server spanning multiple tools with drift detection. No configuration version comparison or diff tools. No automated rollback management. No compliance enforcement via MCP (distinct from ansible-lint — think cross-platform policy engines like Open Policy Agent for config management). No configuration testing or dry-run simulation tools beyond what individual servers provide. The SaltStack server is minimal with only 4 tools and 0 stars. The category earns 3/5 — Ansible dominates with six dedicated servers including an official Red Hat implementation, but the broader configuration management ecosystem is thin. NixOS stands out with the most polished and popular server (mcp-nixos at 476 stars), while Puppet, Chef, and SaltStack — tools used by thousands of organizations — have virtually no MCP presence. The Nix framework projects (mcp-servers-nix, nix-mcp-servers) serve a different purpose — managing MCP server installations rather than infrastructure configuration. Consul has basic coverage. The category would benefit significantly from official vendors (Puppet Labs, Progress Chef) creating MCP servers for their platforms."

Configuration management MCP servers let AI assistants manage infrastructure configuration, execute automation playbooks, query package databases, and orchestrate service discovery through the Model Context Protocol. Instead of writing YAML by hand or memorizing CLI flags, AI agents can manage configuration at scale conversationally.

This review covers the **configuration management** ecosystem — Ansible automation, NixOS package and option queries, SaltStack minion management, Consul service discovery, and multi-tool infrastructure operators. For related servers, see our [Infrastructure Automation review](/reviews/infrastructure-automation-mcp-servers/) and [Container/Docker/Kubernetes review](/reviews/container-docker-kubernetes-mcp-servers/).

The headline findings: **Ansible dominates with six dedicated servers** including an official Red Hat AAP implementation. **NixOS has the most polished single server** (mcp-nixos, 476 stars) with remarkable token efficiency. **Puppet and Chef have zero MCP presence** — a significant gap given their enterprise adoption. Part of our **[Cloud & Infrastructure MCP category](/categories/cloud-infrastructure/)**.

### washyu/ansible-mcp-server — Ansible + Terraform (Archived)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [ansible-mcp-server](https://github.com/washyu/ansible-mcp-server) | 6 | JavaScript | MIT | 58 |

**58 infrastructure management tools** spanning Ansible operations, infrastructure discovery, security capabilities, and service deployment. Includes hardware scanning, port scanning, password audits, and environment-based deployments. **Archived October 2025** — read-only but still useful as reference. The breadth of tools (58) shows what a comprehensive config management MCP server could look like.

## What's Missing

The configuration management MCP ecosystem has significant gaps:

- **No Puppet MCP server** — despite Puppet being used by thousands of organizations for compliance-driven infrastructure management
- **No Chef Infra or InSpec MCP server** — no way to manage Chef cookbooks, recipes, or compliance profiles via MCP
- **No CFEngine, mgmt, or Bcfg2 integration** — older but still-used configuration management tools are absent
- **No drift detection** — no MCP server provides configuration drift detection or remediation across managed hosts
- **No compliance enforcement** — beyond ansible-lint, no cross-platform policy engine (like OPA for config management) exists as an MCP server
- **No configuration diffing** — no tools for comparing configuration versions or visualizing changes before apply
- **No rollback management** — no MCP server provides configuration rollback or state restoration capabilities
- **SaltStack is minimal** — only 4 tools and 0 stars; needs significantly more development

## The Bottom Line

**Rating: 3/5** — Configuration management MCP servers are an uneven category. Ansible dominates with six dedicated servers spanning official Red Hat tooling, enterprise ecosystems, and community implementations. NixOS punches above its weight with mcp-nixos (476 stars) — the most polished and popular server in the category by a wide margin. Consul has basic but functional coverage.

The glaring gaps are Puppet and Chef — two tools used across thousands of enterprise environments with zero MCP presence. SaltStack's single server is barely functional. The multi-tool servers (mcp-sysoperator, the archived ansible-mcp-server) hint at what a unified configuration management MCP could become, but none are production-ready.

For teams using Ansible, the MCP ecosystem is genuinely useful today. For everyone else, this category needs significant investment from tool vendors and the community.
