card_description: "Astronomy and space science MCP servers for accessing NASA data, tracking satellites, querying astronomical surveys, and computing celestial positions through AI assistants. This is a **fascinating emerging category** where scientific data access meets AI tooling. **NASA API servers dominate** — ProgramComputer/NASA-MCP-server (81 stars) leads with access to 20+ NASA and JPL data sources through a single TypeScript server, covering everything from the Astronomy Picture of the Day to exoplanet archives and near-Earth object tracking. **The astronomical research tooling is genuinely impressive** — SandyYuan/astro_mcp provides unified access to 40+ astronomical services (SIMBAD, VizieR, SDSS, Gaia, DESI, MAST, and more) through astroquery, effectively democratizing big-data astronomy by turning complex API choreography into natural language queries. **The astro-orchestra project takes it further** with a multi-agent system where specialized agents (planning, data gathering, analysis, simulation, literature review) collaborate on research tasks — a glimpse of AI-native scientific workflows. **NASA ADS integration is a standout niche** — prtc/nasa-ads-mcp gives AI assistants direct access to astrophysics literature search, citation metrics, and BibTeX export. **CelestialMCP fills the observational astronomy gap** with positioning data for 117,000+ stars and 14,000 deep-sky objects plus a star-hopping pathfinding tool. **Satellite tracking exists but is basic** — one server wraps the N2YO API for position tracking and pass predictions across 31 categories. **The biggest gaps are conspicuous** — no Stellarium or planetarium integration, no James Webb Space Telescope data pipeline, no amateur telescope control (ASCOM/INDI), no SpaceX or launch schedule APIs, no aurora/space weather alerting beyond raw DONKI data, no radio astronomy or gravitational wave tools. The category earns 3.5/5 — the NASA API coverage is solid and the astronomical research tools are genuinely innovative, but consumer-facing space experiences (launch tracking, aurora alerts, telescope control) are largely absent."

## What's Missing

The astronomy and space science MCP ecosystem has notable gaps:

- **No telescope control** — no ASCOM or INDI protocol servers for controlling amateur telescopes, mounts, or cameras remotely
- **No Stellarium integration** — the most popular open-source planetarium has no MCP bridge
- **No James Webb Space Telescope** — no dedicated JWST data pipeline server (some data is accessible through MAST via astro_mcp)
- **No SpaceX or launch schedule APIs** — no rocket launch tracking, countdown, or mission data
- **No aurora/space weather alerting** — DONKI raw data exists in NASA servers, but no dedicated aurora prediction or geomagnetic storm alert server
- **No radio astronomy** — no servers for accessing radio telescope data, pulsar catalogs, or SETI datasets
- **No gravitational wave data** — no LIGO/Virgo event catalog access
- **No light pollution mapping** — no Bortle scale or sky quality data
- **No astrophotography tools** — no image stacking, plate solving, or camera control
- **No planetary simulation** — no Kerbal-style orbital mechanics or mission planning

---

## The Bottom Line

The astronomy and space science MCP ecosystem earns a **3.5 out of 5**.

**What works:** NASA API coverage is solid — ProgramComputer's server gives you 20+ data sources in one package. The astronomical research tools from SandyYuan are genuinely innovative, turning complex multi-survey data access into natural language. NASA ADS integration is a practical win for researchers. CelestialMCP's star-hopping feature is a clever niche tool for amateur astronomers.

**What doesn't:** The category is heavily skewed toward professional/research use. Consumer-facing space experiences — launch tracking, aurora alerts, "what's in the sky tonight" — are largely absent or buried in raw API outputs. Satellite tracking exists but is limited to one server wrapping one API. The total server count is modest compared to more established categories.

**Who benefits most:** Astronomy researchers and data scientists who want natural language access to survey databases. Science communicators who need quick access to NASA imagery and data. Amateur astronomers who want celestial positioning data. Students exploring astronomy data without learning complex APIs.

**Who should wait:** Anyone wanting telescope automation, launch tracking, or polished consumer space experiences. The tools for casual space enthusiasts are still thin — you'll get more from dedicated apps than from MCP servers right now.

| Subcategory | Server Count | Top Server | Rating |
|-------------|-------------|------------|--------|
| NASA APIs | 3 | ProgramComputer/NASA-MCP-server (81 stars) | ★★★★ |
| Astronomical research | 3 | SandyYuan/astro_mcp (40+ services) | ★★★★ |
| Celestial positioning | 1 | Rkm1999/CelestialMCP (117k stars, 14k DSOs) | ★★★ |
| Satellite tracking | 1 | Cyreslab-AI/satellitetracking-mcp-server (6 tools) | ★★★ |

**Overall: 3.5/5** — Strong scientific data access and innovative research tools, but thin on consumer-facing space experiences and missing major data sources like JWST, launch schedules, and telescope control.
