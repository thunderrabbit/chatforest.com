**At a glance:** [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) (81.8k stars, 10k forks, 7 active reference servers) + [Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) (22.3k stars) + [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) (11.9k stars). Anthropic **invented MCP** in November 2024 and operates the most comprehensive MCP ecosystem: reference servers, official SDKs in 10+ languages, the protocol specification, and the most mature MCP client support across Claude.ai, Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and the API. Part of our **[AI Providers MCP category](/categories/ai-providers/)**.

Anthropic MCP servers provide the **reference implementations** that define how MCP servers should work — file system access, Git operations, web fetching, persistent memory, and sequential reasoning. These aren't wrappers around the Claude API (Anthropic's products ARE the MCP clients). Instead, they're the foundational tools that demonstrate what MCP can do and how to build servers correctly.

[Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) was founded in 2021 by **Dario Amodei** and **Daniela Amodei**, along with several former OpenAI researchers. As of early 2026: approximately **$19 billion annualized revenue** (up from $9B at end of 2025), **$380 billion valuation** (February 2026 Series G, $30B raised), **300,000+ business customers**, Claude Code alone generating **$2.5 billion annualized revenue**, and approximately **3,000 employees**. Key products include Claude (Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5), Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and the Messages/Responses API.

**Architecture note:** Anthropic's MCP role is unique: they are both the **protocol creator** and the **leading MCP client**. Unlike OpenAI (primarily a client), Google (official remote servers), or Microsoft (enterprise MCP servers), Anthropic designed the entire protocol, maintains the specification, provides the SDKs, and built the most capable MCP client implementations. They donated MCP to the [Agentic AI Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-the-formation-of-the-agentic-ai-foundation) (Linux Foundation) in December 2025, co-founded with OpenAI and Block.

## What It Does

Anthropic maintains 7 active reference servers that demonstrate core MCP capabilities:

### Development Tools

## MCP Governance

Anthropic donated MCP to the **Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)** in December 2025:

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Foundation | Agentic AI Foundation, directed fund under the Linux Foundation |
| Co-founders | Anthropic, Block, OpenAI |
| Platinum members | Amazon Web Services, Anthropic, Block, Bloomberg, Cloudflare, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI |
| Donated projects | MCP (Anthropic), goose (Block), AGENTS.md (OpenAI) |
| Governance | Governing Board makes strategic decisions; individual projects maintain technical autonomy |

## Claude API Pricing

| Model | Input (per 1M tokens) | Cached Input | Output (per 1M tokens) | Context Window |
|-------|----------------------|--------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Haiku 4.5 | $1.00 | $0.10 | $5.00 | 200K |
| Sonnet 4.6 | $3.00 | $0.30 | $15.00 | 200K |
| Sonnet 4.6 (>200K input) | $6.00 | $0.60 | $22.50 | 1M |
| Opus 4.6 | $5.00 | $0.50 | $25.00 | 1M |

| Cost Optimization | Discount |
|-------------------|----------|
| Prompt caching (5-min) | Writes 1.25x, reads 0.1x base price |

**Claude subscriptions:**
- Claude Free — limited access, supports MCP Connectors
- Claude Pro — $20/month
- Claude Team — $25/user/month
- Claude Enterprise — custom pricing
- Claude Code — $20/month (Max: usage-based, ~$100-200/month typical)

**Note:** MCP tool calls incur standard token billing — there's no MCP-specific surcharge. The tool definitions and results count toward your input/output tokens.

## Known Issues

1. **No MCP server wrapping the Claude API** — Anthropic focuses on the client side. There is no official MCP server that lets other AI agents (GPT, Gemini) call Claude via MCP. Community implementations like [mnthe/claude-agent-mcp-server](https://github.com/mnthe/claude-agent-mcp-server) (0 stars, 43 commits, TypeScript) exist but have minimal adoption.

2. **Archived reference servers cause confusion** — The 14 original reference servers (Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, Postgres, etc.) were archived May 2025 with no security guarantees. Tutorials and blog posts still reference them, leading developers to use unmaintained code in production.

3. **Git MCP server security flaws** — Anthropic's official Git reference server was [found to have security vulnerabilities](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/anthropics-official-git-mcp-server-had-some-worrying-security-flaws-this-is-what-happened-next) that could allow command injection. While addressed, this highlighted the risks of reference servers being treated as production-ready.

4. **Desktop Extension ecosystem is young** — The .mcpb format was introduced recently and the extension ecosystem is still growing. Most MCP servers are still installed manually via config files rather than one-click extensions.

5. **Connector availability varies by plan** — While all Claude.ai plans support MCP Connectors, the Connectors Directory and admin controls differ between Free, Pro, Team, and Enterprise tiers. Some connectors require Team or Enterprise plans.

6. **SDK version fragmentation** — Both Python and TypeScript SDKs have v2 pre-alpha on main branches while v1.x remains the stable production version. Developers must be careful to use the correct branch. Breaking changes expected in v2 (e.g., Zod v4 requirement in TypeScript SDK).

7. **MCP specification still evolving** — New features like MCP Apps, Elicitation (servers requesting structured input mid-task), and the Apps Extension (SEP-1865, co-developed with OpenAI) are being added. Servers built against older spec versions may need updates.

8. **MCP Connector API is beta** — The `mcp_servers` API parameter for remote servers is in beta. Production deployments should monitor for breaking changes in the connector interface.

9. **No centralized MCP server registry by Anthropic** — While Anthropic provides a Connectors Directory for vetted integrations, there's no single Anthropic-run registry of all available MCP servers. Third-party directories (claudemcp.com, PulseMCP, Glama) fill this gap with varying completeness.

10. **AAIF governance is new** — MCP was donated to the Agentic AI Foundation in December 2025. The long-term impact of multi-stakeholder governance (with OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, AWS on the board) on MCP's direction is still unfolding. Anthropic retains technical influence but no longer unilateral control.

## Bottom Line

**Rating: 4.5 out of 5**

Anthropic doesn't just participate in the MCP ecosystem — they **created it**. The Model Context Protocol was designed, specified, and open-sourced by Anthropic in November 2024, and their commitment shows: 81.8k stars on the reference servers repo, 34k+ combined stars on the Python and TypeScript SDKs, 10+ language SDKs, and the most comprehensive MCP client support of any AI company.

On the **client side**, Anthropic is unmatched. Claude.ai Connectors, Claude Desktop with one-click Desktop Extensions, Claude Code with automatic connector sharing, the MCP Connector API, and MCP Apps (interactive UI in chat) represent the deepest MCP integration of any AI platform. Every Claude product speaks MCP natively.

On the **server side**, the 7 active reference servers (Filesystem, Git, Fetch, Memory, Sequential Thinking, Time, Everything) are well-designed demonstrations of MCP capabilities, not production tools. The 14 archived servers (Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, Postgres) have been superseded by independent maintainers and official implementations from the respective service providers.

The 4.5/5 rating reflects Anthropic's unrivaled position as MCP's creator and most committed implementer. The protocol itself is the ecosystem's foundation, the SDKs power thousands of community servers, and Claude's client support is the most comprehensive available. The half-point deduction is for the lack of a Claude API wrapper server (limiting cross-model use), archived reference server confusion, and the still-evolving specification and governance structure.

**Who benefits most from Anthropic's MCP ecosystem:**

- **MCP server developers** — the SDKs, specification, and reference servers are the definitive starting point for building any MCP server
- **Claude users** — Connectors, Desktop Extensions, and Claude Code MCP support provide the richest MCP client experience available
- **Enterprise teams** — Team and Enterprise plans offer admin controls, custom extension registries, and governance tools for MCP at scale

**Who should be cautious:**

- **Developers using archived reference servers** — switch to actively maintained alternatives; the archived versions have no security guarantees
- **Teams building on v2 SDK pre-alpha** — the v1.x branches are the stable choice until v2 officially ships
- **Anyone expecting a Claude API MCP server** — Anthropic builds clients, not a server wrapping their own API; use the API directly or find a community wrapper
