**At a glance:** 1.4K GitHub stars, 230 forks, 25 tools across 13 resource categories, ~992K all-time PulseMCP visitors (#47 globally, ~14.4K weekly), v0.3.1 current, ChatGPT + Claude Code + Cursor + VS Code supported, part of Stripe's Agentic Commerce Suite (March 2026).

The Stripe MCP server is Stripe's official bridge between AI assistants and payment infrastructure. It now lives in the [stripe/ai](https://github.com/stripe/ai) monorepo — a consolidated home that also includes `@stripe/agent-toolkit` (framework integrations for OpenAI, LangChain, CrewAI, Vercel AI SDK), `@stripe/ai-sdk` (connects Stripe billing with Vercel's AI libraries), and `@stripe/token-meter` (usage metering with native SDKs from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google).

The server itself provides 25 tools covering the core payment lifecycle: creating customers, managing products and prices, handling invoices and subscriptions, processing refunds, and — uniquely — searching Stripe's documentation and knowledge base directly from within your AI assistant.

You can connect via Stripe's hosted remote server at `mcp.stripe.com` (OAuth) or run it locally via npx with an API key. Both approaches work, but the security model differs significantly between them.

The key question: does Stripe's MCP server cover enough of the API to be genuinely useful, or is it a marketing-friendly subset that forces you back to the dashboard for real work?

## What's New (March 2026 Update)

**Machine Payments Protocol (MPP) launched March 18.** Stripe and Tempo co-authored an open standard for AI agent payments — letting agents autonomously pay for resources via microtransactions, pay-as-you-go, and recurring billing. MPP supports stablecoins, fiat via Shared Payment Tokens (SPTs), credit cards, and BNPL. Stripe users accept MPP payments through the existing PaymentIntents API. Early adopters include Browserbase (pay-per-session headless browsers), Postalform (physical mail), and Prospect Butcher Co. (food ordering). MPP complements MCP: MCP lets agents *use* Stripe, MPP lets agents *pay through* Stripe.

**Agentic Commerce Suite.** MPP is one piece of a broader push. Stripe now positions MCP alongside the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP), MPP, and x402 as its "Agentic Commerce Suite" — a full stack for AI agents that need to discover services, authenticate, transact, and manage payments.

**Repository consolidated to stripe/ai.** The former `stripe/agent-toolkit` is now part of the `stripe/ai` monorepo (1.4K stars, 230 forks). Two new sibling packages joined: `@stripe/ai-sdk` for Vercel AI billing integration and `@stripe/token-meter` for usage-based metering with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google SDKs — no framework dependency required.

**Broader client support documented.** Stripe now provides official setup instructions for ChatGPT (Pro+ accounts via OAuth connectors), Claude Code (`claude mcp add --transport http stripe https://mcp.stripe.com/`), Cursor, and VS Code — in addition to the existing Claude Desktop support. One-click install links for Cursor and VS Code.

**list_customers still returns IDs only.** Issue #220, opened January 26, remains open. The `list_customers` tool returns only customer IDs — no name, email, address, or other fields. The documentation says it wraps `/customers/list` (which returns full objects), but the implementation strips everything except the ID. For agentic workflows that need customer details, this is a significant gap.

**Protocol version bug persists.** Issue #290 (March 2) remains open. The local server hangs indefinitely when clients send protocol version "2025-11-25" — the version Claude Desktop uses by default. No fix in v0.3.1. Workaround: use the remote server at mcp.stripe.com, which handles protocol negotiation correctly.

**Open issues down to 9** (from an untracked baseline). Recently closed: #250 (proxy MCP client name in local stdio server, Mar 18). New community requests: #307 (rate limiting/security policy guide), #296 (AI SDK v6 support), #293 (security policy template).

## What It Does

The Stripe MCP server exposes tools across 13 resource categories:

| Category | Tools | Operations |
|----------|-------|------------|
| **Accounts** | 1 | Retrieve account info |
| **Balance** | 1 | Retrieve current balance |
| **Coupons** | 2 | Create, list |
| **Customers** | 2 | Create, list |
| **Disputes** | 2 | List, update |
| **Invoices** | 4 | Create, finalize, list, create items |
| **Payment Links** | 1 | Create |
| **PaymentIntents** | 1 | List |
| **Prices** | 2 | Create, list |
| **Products** | 2 | Create, list |
| **Refunds** | 1 | Create |
| **Subscriptions** | 3 | Cancel, list, update |
| **Search/Docs** | 3 | Search resources, fetch objects, search documentation |

That's 25 tools total. The pattern is consistent: you can create and list most resources, but updating and deleting are sparse. You can create a customer but not update their email. You can list payment intents but not create them directly (you'd use payment links instead). You can cancel a subscription but not pause it.

The two standout tools are **search_stripe_resources** and **search_stripe_documentation**:

- `search_stripe_resources` lets you query across customers, invoices, products, subscriptions, charges, and payment intents using Stripe's search syntax. Ask "find all customers with email containing @acme.com" and the agent translates that to Stripe's query language.
- `search_stripe_documentation` searches Stripe's knowledge base — docs, guides, API references, support articles. This is genuinely useful when building Stripe integrations: the agent can look up the right approach without you leaving your editor.

## Setup

**Remote (recommended):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stripe": {
      "url": "https://mcp.stripe.com"
    }
  }
}
```

First connection opens a browser for OAuth consent. You select the Stripe account, approve permissions, and you're connected. No API keys to manage, no environment variables to set.

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http stripe https://mcp.stripe.com/
```

**Local via npx:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stripe": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@stripe/mcp@latest", "--api-key=sk_test_..."]
    }
  }
}
```

**Local via Docker:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stripe": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i", "mcp/stripe", "--api-key=sk_test_..."]
    }
  }
}
```

The remote setup is the cleanest we've seen for any payment-related MCP server — one URL, OAuth handles the rest. The local setup requires a Stripe secret key, which is standard but carries more risk than OAuth tokens.

## What's Good

**Documentation search is a killer feature.** Most MCP servers connect you to a product's API. Stripe's also connects you to its documentation. When you're building a Stripe integration and hit a question about webhook signatures or idempotency keys, the agent can search Stripe's knowledge base directly. No tab-switching, no copy-pasting error messages into Google. This is the kind of tool that makes the MCP server more useful than just a Stripe API wrapper.

**The security model is well-designed.** Stripe offers three layers of access control: OAuth with granular consent (remote), restricted API keys with per-resource permissions (local), and the recommendation to always enable manual tool confirmation. Restricted API Keys (rk_*) let you limit a local server to read-only access on specific resources — so an agent helping with customer support can list customers and invoices but never issue refunds. This is meaningfully more granular than most MCP servers we've reviewed.

**OAuth session management through the dashboard.** Admins can see which MCP clients have connected, review their permissions, and revoke access — all from the Stripe Dashboard. Compare this to MCP servers that hand you a static API key and hope for the best.

**The stripe/ai monorepo is bigger than the MCP server.** If you outgrow MCP, the same monorepo provides `@stripe/agent-toolkit` with native integrations for OpenAI's Agent SDK, LangChain, CrewAI, and Vercel's AI SDK. The new `@stripe/token-meter` package adds usage-based billing for AI applications without any framework dependency. You can start with MCP for exploration and graduate to framework-specific integration when you need tighter control. The MCP server and the framework integrations share the same tool definitions, so the transition is smooth.

**Both remote and local deployment.** The remote server at `mcp.stripe.com` is ideal for security-conscious teams — no secret keys on developer machines, centralized session management, OAuth consent flow. The local `npx` deployment is ideal for development and testing with sandbox keys. Having both options puts Stripe ahead of servers that force one approach.

**Wide client support.** Official setup docs now cover Claude Desktop, Claude Code, ChatGPT (Pro+), Cursor, and VS Code — with one-click install for the latter two. This is among the broadest first-party client support we've seen from any MCP server vendor.

## Where It Falls Short

**Coverage is still shallow.** 25 tools across 13 categories sounds reasonable until you compare it to Stripe's actual API surface. Stripe has hundreds of API endpoints covering payment methods, SetupIntents, checkout sessions, billing portal, tax, Connect, Terminal, Financial Connections, Identity, Issuing, Treasury, and more. The MCP server covers maybe 10-15% of the API. The tool count hasn't changed since launch — no new tools have been added despite growing community requests. If you need to create a Checkout Session, manage a Connect account, or handle tax calculations, you're back to the API docs and manual coding.

**list_customers is broken.** The tool returns only customer IDs, not the full customer objects the documentation promises (issue #220, open since January). Name, email, address, currency — all stripped. This makes customer lookup workflows effectively useless until fixed. For a payment platform, not being able to retrieve customer details through the AI assistant is a glaring gap.

**No update operations for most resources.** You can create a customer and list customers, but you can't update a customer's address. You can create a product but not archive it. You can list payment intents but not capture them. This makes the server useful for getting information out of Stripe and creating new records, but significantly less useful for managing existing ones. For a payment platform where most daily work involves modifying existing records, this is a real gap.

**Protocol version incompatibility persists.** The local server still hangs indefinitely when clients send protocol version "2025-11-25" — the version Claude Desktop uses by default (issue #290, open since March 2). Rather than negotiating to a compatible version or returning an error, it silently hangs for 60 seconds. The remote server at mcp.stripe.com works fine; this only affects local npx/Docker deployment.

**No webhooks, no event handling.** Stripe's real power for production systems is its webhook-driven architecture — payment succeeded, subscription canceled, dispute opened. The MCP server has no tools for managing webhook endpoints, listing events, or replaying failed deliveries. For ops work (debugging why a webhook wasn't delivered, checking what events fired for a specific payment), you're still going to the dashboard.

**TypeScript-only local deployment.** The local server requires Node.js — there's no Python implementation from Stripe, despite the Agent Toolkit having a Python SDK for framework integrations. Community Python alternatives exist but are limited (5-8 tools, no OAuth, spotty test coverage).

## Who's It For

The Stripe MCP server works best for **developers building Stripe integrations** rather than ops teams managing live payments. The documentation search alone makes it worth installing during development — having an agent that can instantly look up the right Stripe approach saves meaningful time.

For **finance/ops teams** doing daily payment management (refunding charges, updating subscriptions, investigating disputes), the tool coverage is too thin. You'll constantly hit walls where the tool you need doesn't exist, and fall back to the dashboard.

For **startups prototyping with Stripe**, the combination of sandbox keys + local server + documentation search is excellent. Create test customers, set up products and prices, generate payment links, build subscription flows — all through natural language. When your product graduates to production, switch to restricted API keys with minimal permissions.

For **AI agent builders**, the MPP announcement signals where Stripe is heading. If you're building agents that need to make or accept payments, the combination of MCP (for managing Stripe resources) and MPP (for agent-to-agent transactions) is the most complete payment stack available for agentic workflows.

## The Bottom Line

Stripe's MCP server is a **4/5**. The security model is among the best we've reviewed — three-layer access control with OAuth, restricted keys, and manual confirmation. The documentation search is a genuinely differentiated feature that no community alternative matches. The remote server setup is dead simple, and client support now spans five major platforms.

The March 2026 MPP launch and Agentic Commerce Suite show Stripe thinking seriously about AI-native payments. But the MCP server itself hasn't kept pace — the tool count is unchanged since launch, list_customers is broken, and the protocol version bug remains unfixed. The vision is ambitious; the execution on the MCP layer is still catching up.

The Agent Toolkit framing is smart: start with MCP for exploration and documentation, graduate to framework-specific integration for production. But for users evaluating the MCP server on its own merits, "useful for development, insufficient for operations" remains the honest assessment. The rating holds at 4/5 on the strength of security, docs search, and ecosystem positioning — but tool coverage needs to expand significantly before we'd consider raising it.

**Rating: 4/5** — Best-in-class security model, unique documentation search, and ambitious agentic commerce vision, but shallow API coverage and open bugs limit it to development workflows.
