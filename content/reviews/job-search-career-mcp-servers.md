card_description: "Job search and career MCP servers for LinkedIn scraping, multi-platform job aggregation, resume tailoring, and interview preparation through AI assistants. This is a **rapidly growing category driven by the AI job search automation wave**. **LinkedIn dominates the ecosystem** — at least 8 MCP servers exist for LinkedIn alone, covering profile scraping, job search, company analysis, and even automated applications. stickerdaniel/linkedin-mcp-server and eliasbiondo/linkedin-mcp-server are the most feature-complete, offering structured JSON extraction of profiles, companies, and job listings. **The multi-platform aggregators are the most practical** — borgius/jobspy-mcp-server searches Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and ZipRecruiter simultaneously, while Indeed's official MCP server provides legitimate API access to job listings and company data. **Resume tailoring is an emerging niche** — Sakshee5/JobApply analyzes job descriptions and generates tailored resumes and cover letters locally, with no subscription required. **Interview prep servers are surprisingly capable** — HelloGGX/interview-mcp-server extracts questions from resumes and evaluates recordings, while ejb503/interview-roleplay simulates dynamic interview scenarios with real-time feedback. **The biggest concerns are ethical and legal** — many LinkedIn servers rely on scraping rather than official APIs, and automated job application servers raise questions about platform terms of service. **Major gaps remain** — no Glassdoor salary data, no freelance platform integration (Upwork/Fiverr/Toptal), no networking or referral tools, no career path planning, and no skills assessment servers. The category earns 3.5/5 — extensive LinkedIn coverage and solid job aggregation, but the reliance on scraping and the absence of official platform partnerships limit reliability."

Job search and career MCP servers connect AI agents to job boards, professional networks, resume tools, and interview platforms. Instead of manually searching Indeed, tailoring resumes for each application, or practicing interview questions alone, these servers let you search across platforms, analyze job descriptions, generate tailored materials, and simulate interviews through natural language via the Model Context Protocol.

This review covers **LinkedIn integration, multi-platform job aggregation, resume and application tools, and interview preparation** — the full job search workflow from discovery to offer. For HR and recruiting from the employer side, see our [HR & Recruiting review](/reviews/hr-recruiting-mcp-servers/) if available.

The headline findings: **LinkedIn has the richest MCP ecosystem** with 8+ servers covering profiles, jobs, companies, and automated applications. **Multi-platform job aggregation is the most practical feature** — jobspy-mcp-server searches Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and ZipRecruiter in one query. **Indeed launched an official MCP server** with legitimate API access. **Resume tailoring runs entirely locally** via JobApply with no subscriptions. **The biggest concern: most LinkedIn servers rely on scraping**, which may violate platform terms of service.

## LinkedIn Integration

### stickerdaniel/linkedin-mcp-server — LinkedIn Scraper for Profiles, Companies, and Jobs

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [linkedin-mcp-server](https://github.com/stickerdaniel/linkedin-mcp-server) | — | TypeScript | — | 5+ |

**Full LinkedIn access via browser-based authentication:**

- **Profile scraping** — extract work history, education, skills, and contact info from any LinkedIn profile
- **Company data** — company details, employee counts, and industry information
- **Job search** — search LinkedIn jobs with keyword, location, and experience filters
- **Job details** — full job descriptions and application requirements
- **Browser auth** — authenticates through your existing browser session

One of the most feature-complete LinkedIn MCP servers. Uses browser automation rather than official APIs, so it requires a LinkedIn account and may be affected by LinkedIn's anti-scraping measures. Designed for Claude and other MCP-compatible AI assistants.

### eliasbiondo/linkedin-mcp-server — Structured LinkedIn Data Extraction

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [linkedin-mcp-server](https://github.com/eliasbiondo/linkedin-mcp-server) | — | TypeScript | — | 4+ |

**Search and scrape LinkedIn with structured JSON output:**

- **Search people** — find LinkedIn profiles by name, title, company, or keywords
- **Search companies** — company lookup with structured data extraction
- **Search jobs** — job listings with filters
- **Profile scraping** — structured JSON output of profile data for downstream processing

Focuses on returning clean, structured data rather than raw HTML — useful when you need to feed LinkedIn data into other tools or analysis workflows.

### Hritik003/linkedin-mcp — Automated Job Applications

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [linkedin-mcp](https://github.com/Hritik003/linkedin-mcp) | — | Python | — | 3+ |

**LinkedIn integration focused on job applications:**

- **Profile retrieval** — access your own LinkedIn profile data
- **Job search** — discover relevant positions
- **Job application** — submit applications through LinkedIn (Easy Apply and similar)
- **Application tracking** — monitor submitted applications

The most ambitious LinkedIn MCP server — it doesn't just search for jobs, it attempts to apply to them. This raises obvious questions about LinkedIn's terms of service and the ethics of automated applications, but it represents where AI job search is heading.

### adhikasp/mcp-linkedin — LinkedIn Feeds and Job API

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|

**Access LinkedIn feeds and job data:**

- **Feed access** — read your LinkedIn feed posts and updates
- **Job API** — search and retrieve job listings
- **Profile interaction** — view profiles and connections

A lighter-weight LinkedIn integration focused on feeds and jobs rather than full profile scraping. Useful for staying informed about industry news and job postings within your network.

### GhoshSrinjoy/linkedin-job-mcp — Filtered Job Search with Geocoding

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [linkedin-job-mcp](https://github.com/GhoshSrinjoy/linkedin-job-mcp) | — | Node.js | — | 3+ |

**LinkedIn job search with advanced filtering:**

- **Location filtering** — search by city, state, or country with dynamic geocoding
- **Experience level** — filter by entry, associate, mid-senior, director, executive
- **Salary filtering** — minimum salary thresholds
- **Caching and rate limiting** — built-in request management to avoid LinkedIn blocks
- **Structured JSON output** — clean data for integration with other tools

Well-engineered with practical features like geocoding (converts city names to LinkedIn location IDs) and rate limiting. The Node.js backend demonstrates good practices for handling web automation.

### Other LinkedIn Servers

- **Rayyan9477/linkedin_mcp** — profile management and resume analysis features
- **superyuser/linkedin-scraper-mcp** — comprehensive profile data extraction with manual credential input
- **zarif007/linkedin-job-search** — TypeScript job search with customizable parameters

## Multi-Platform Job Search

### borgius/jobspy-mcp-server — Cross-Platform Job Aggregator

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [jobspy-mcp-server](https://github.com/borgius/jobspy-mcp-server) | — | Python | — | 3+ |

**Search multiple job platforms simultaneously:**

- **Indeed** — search Indeed job listings with keyword and location filters
- **LinkedIn** — LinkedIn job search integration
- **Glassdoor** — Glassdoor job listings
- **ZipRecruiter** — ZipRecruiter integration
- **Unified results** — consistent format across all platforms for easy comparison

The most practical job search MCP server for actual job seekers. Instead of checking four different sites, you get aggregated results. Built on the JobSpy library which handles the cross-platform scraping.

### Indeed Official MCP Server — Legitimate Indeed API Access

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [Indeed MCP](https://docs.indeed.com/mcp/) | — | — | — | 2+ |

**Official Indeed integration for job search:**

- **Job search** — search Indeed jobs by title, keywords, location, and employment type
- **Company info** — access company profiles and information
- **Structured results** — job titles, companies, locations, salaries, and application URLs
- **Official API** — legitimate access backed by Indeed, not scraping

Indeed was one of the first major job platforms to ship an official MCP server. This means stable, sanctioned access — you won't get blocked or have your account flagged. The tool count is modest compared to scrapers, but the reliability trade-off is worth it for serious job seekers.

### Other Multi-Platform Servers

- **Ritesh-sudo/MCPJobSearch** — multi-platform job search targeting AI/ML and tech roles
- **Bright Data Indeed MCP** — structured Indeed data extraction via Bright Data's infrastructure
- **patiza604/indeed_mcp_server** — community Indeed integration

## Resume & Application Tools

### Sakshee5/JobApply — Resume Tailoring and Application Management

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [JobApply](https://github.com/Sakshee5/JobApply) | — | Python | MIT | 3+ |

**AI-driven resume tailoring and application tracking:**

- **Job description matching** — analyze job postings for required qualifications
- **Tailored resume generation** — create customized resumes that match specific job requirements
- **Cover letter generation** — draft cover letters aligned to the job description
- **Application tracking** — keep records of where you've applied

Runs entirely locally with no paid subscriptions — clone the repo and use it. The resume tailoring approach aims to optimize for ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility, which is increasingly important as companies automate their initial screening.

## Interview Preparation

### HelloGGX/interview-mcp-server — AI Interview Assistant

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|

**Automated interview preparation and evaluation:**

- **Resume analysis** — extract likely interview questions based on your resume and target role
- **Recording evaluation** — analyze interview recordings for content and delivery
- **Comprehensive feedback** — evaluate answers for completeness, relevance, and communication skills

Goes beyond simple question banks — it generates questions personalized to your specific resume and role, then evaluates your actual responses. Useful for structured practice.

### ejb503/interview-roleplay — Dynamic Interview Simulation

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [interview-roleplay](https://github.com/ejb503/interview-roleplay) | — | — | — | 2+ |

- **Dynamic conversation** — natural conversation flow rather than static Q&A
- **Real-time feedback** — immediate evaluation of responses
- **Role customization** — adjust interviewer style and difficulty level

The roleplay approach is more realistic than flashcard-style practice. The dynamic conversation means follow-up questions adapt based on your answers, simulating how real interviews flow.

### InterviewReady/mcp-server — Interview Study Resources

## What's Missing

The job search MCP space has significant gaps:

- **Glassdoor salary data** — no server provides access to salary ranges, company reviews, or interview experiences from Glassdoor's database
- **AngelList / Wellfound** — no startup-focused job board integration
- **Freelance platforms** — no Upwork, Fiverr, Toptal, or freelance marketplace servers
- **Salary negotiation** — no tools for compensation research, offer comparison, or negotiation guidance
- **Portfolio builders** — no servers that help create or manage professional portfolios
- **Networking tools** — no referral tracking, networking event discovery, or warm introduction tools
- **Career path planning** — no tools that analyze career trajectories or suggest development paths
- **Skills assessment** — no coding challenge platforms (LeetCode, HackerRank) or skills verification tools
- **Background check** — no pre-employment screening or verification tools
- **Onboarding** — no new-hire onboarding or first-90-days planning tools
- **Remote job boards** — no specialized remote-first job boards (We Work Remotely, Remote.co, FlexJobs)
- **Government jobs** — no USAJOBS or public sector job board integration
- **Academic positions** — no academic job boards (HigherEdJobs, Academic Transfer)

---

## Bottom Line

The job search and career MCP server category is **LinkedIn-heavy but practically useful**. If you're actively job searching, borgius/jobspy-mcp-server's cross-platform aggregation saves real time — searching Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and ZipRecruiter in one query beats manually cycling through tabs. Indeed's official MCP server adds legitimate, stable access to one of the world's largest job boards.

The LinkedIn ecosystem is extensive but comes with caveats. Most servers rely on browser automation and scraping rather than official APIs, which means they could break at any time and may violate LinkedIn's terms of service. The automated application servers (like Hritik003/linkedin-mcp) are technically impressive but ethically questionable — mass-automated applications degrade the experience for everyone.

Resume tailoring through JobApply is genuinely practical — it runs locally, costs nothing, and addresses the real problem of customizing resumes for each application. The interview prep servers show real promise, particularly the roleplay-based approaches that simulate dynamic conversations rather than static Q&A.

**Rating: 3.5/5** — Strong LinkedIn coverage and useful job aggregation tools, but the heavy reliance on scraping over official APIs creates reliability concerns. The absence of salary data, freelance platforms, and career planning tools leaves significant workflow gaps. The ethical questions around automated applications also weigh against the category. If Indeed's official MCP approach becomes the norm and more platforms ship sanctioned integrations, this category could easily reach 4/5.
