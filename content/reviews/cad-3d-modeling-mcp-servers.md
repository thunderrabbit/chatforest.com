card_description: "CAD and 3D modeling is one of the most active MCP verticals by star count, driven almost entirely by **Blender MCP** (17,800 stars) — the third most-starred MCP server overall. Beyond Blender, the ecosystem covers the full spectrum of computer-aided design: **FreeCAD MCP** (617 stars, Python, MIT) gives AI agents 10 tools for creating and editing parametric 3D models with parts library access. **KiCad MCP** (405 stars, Python, MIT) enables AI-assisted PCB design with netlist extraction, BOM generation, and design rule checking. **CAD-MCP** (270 stars, Python, MIT) controls AutoCAD, GstarCAD, and ZWCAD through natural language drawing commands. **AutoCAD MCP** (177 stars, Python/AutoLISP, MIT) is the most engineered AutoCAD integration — dual backends (File IPC for live AutoCAD, ezdxf for headless), focus-free dispatch, P&ID symbol library, and undo/redo. **OpenSCAD MCP** (135 stars, Python, MIT) takes a unique approach — generating 3D models from text descriptions or images via Gemini AI and multi-view reconstruction, with direct 3D printer support. **SolidWorks MCP** (67 stars, Python/C#, MIT) bridges Claude to SolidWorks via a version-aware C# adapter and COM bridge. **Fusion 360** has two community servers (19-27 stars) with up to 30 tools for sketching, features, and export. **Seeed Studio's KiCad MCP** (20 stars, 39 tools) adds embedded code generation and hardware validation — it can generate device trees and HAL initialization code from schematics. **Onshape MCP** (11 stars, TypeScript, MIT) offers cloud-native CAD integration via REST API. The category's strength is breadth — every major CAD platform has at least one MCP server. The weakness is depth — most servers beyond Blender and FreeCAD have minimal adoption and incomplete tool coverage. No official vendor servers exist from Autodesk, Dassault (SolidWorks), Siemens (NX/Solid Edge), or PTC (Creo)."

CAD and 3D modeling MCP servers let AI agents create, modify, and analyze engineering designs and 3D models through natural language. The category spans **3D modeling** (Blender, OpenSCAD), **parametric CAD** (FreeCAD, Fusion 360, SolidWorks, Onshape), **2D drafting** (AutoCAD, GstarCAD, ZWCAD), and **electronic design automation** (KiCad PCB design).

The headline: **Blender MCP dominates by stars** (17,800 — one of the most-starred MCP servers in any category), but the engineering CAD side is where the more interesting integrations are happening. **FreeCAD MCP** (617 stars) and **KiCad MCP** (405 stars) show genuine demand from the open-source engineering community. **AutoCAD MCP** (177 stars) demonstrates surprisingly sophisticated architecture with dual backends and focus-free dispatch. The biggest gap: **no official vendor servers** from Autodesk, Dassault Systèmes, Siemens, or PTC.

## 3D Modeling & Visualization

### Blender MCP

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [ahujasid/blender-mcp](https://github.com/ahujasid/blender-mcp) | ~17,800 stars |
| License | MIT |
| Language | Python |
| Transport | stdio (socket-based) |

The most popular CAD/3D MCP server by a massive margin. Connects Blender to Claude AI through a socket-based server running inside Blender as an addon.

### What Works Well

**Breadth of integration.** Object creation, modification, deletion, material application, scene inspection, arbitrary Python code execution within Blender, viewport screenshots — this covers the full modeling workflow. The `execute_code` capability means anything Blender's Python API can do, the AI can do.

**Asset ecosystem integration.** Built-in Poly Haven integration for downloading HDRI environments, textures, and 3D models. Hyper3D Rodin integration for AI-generated 3D models — describe an object in text and get a 3D mesh. Sketchfab model search and download. These make it genuinely useful for rapid scene assembly.

**Community momentum.** 17,800 stars means extensive testing, active issue resolution, and a large user base discovering and reporting edge cases. This is one of the most battle-tested MCP servers in any category.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**Art-focused, not engineering-focused.** Blender's strength is organic modeling, animation, and rendering — not parametric engineering design. You won't get constraint-driven sketches, parametric dimensions, or manufacturing-ready output. For engineering CAD, look at FreeCAD or Fusion 360 servers below.

**Socket architecture limitations.** The Blender addon runs a socket server that the MCP server connects to. This means Blender must be running first, and network configuration can be finicky — especially in containerized or remote environments.

### OpenSCAD MCP

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [jhacksman/OpenSCAD-MCP-Server](https://github.com/jhacksman/OpenSCAD-MCP-Server) | ~135 stars |
| License | MIT |
| Language | Python |
| Tools | 10 |

Takes a unique approach: **text-to-3D via AI image generation and multi-view reconstruction.** Instead of directly scripting OpenSCAD geometry, it generates concept images using Google Gemini or Venice.ai, creates multi-view images for 3D reconstruction, and produces OpenSCAD-compatible output. Supports export to OBJ, STL, PLY, SCAD, CSG, AMF, and 3MF formats.

The standout feature is **direct 3D printer support** — network-based printer discovery and printing from within the MCP workflow. The image approval workflow lets you review AI-generated concepts before committing to 3D reconstruction, which is smart given how unpredictable generative 3D can be.

Three other OpenSCAD MCP servers exist ([rahulgarg123/openscad-mcp](https://github.com/rahulgarg123/openscad-mcp), [quellant/openscad-mcp](https://github.com/quellant/openscad-mcp), [fboldo/openscad-mcp-server](https://github.com/fboldo/openscad-mcp-server)) — these focus on rendering SCAD code to PNG/STL rather than the generative AI pipeline.

## Parametric CAD

### FreeCAD MCP

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [neka-nat/freecad-mcp](https://github.com/neka-nat/freecad-mcp) | ~617 stars |
| License | MIT |
| Language | Python |
| Tools | 10 |

The most popular open-source engineering CAD MCP server. Runs as a FreeCAD addon with an RPC server that communicates with Claude Desktop.

### What Works Well

**Parts library integration.** `insert_part_from_library` and `get_parts_list` let the AI browse and insert from FreeCAD's component library — useful for assembly workflows where you're combining standard parts.

**Remote operation.** Supports IP-based access control via CIDR whitelisting, binding to `0.0.0.0` for network access. This enables running FreeCAD on a powerful workstation while controlling it from a laptop.

**Code execution escape hatch.** `execute_code` runs arbitrary Python scripts within FreeCAD's environment, giving access to the full FreeCAD Python API. When the 10 built-in tools aren't enough, the AI can script anything FreeCAD can do.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**Limited built-in tools.** Only 10 tools — create/edit/delete objects, document management, parts library, and view capture. No direct tools for sketching constraints, boolean operations on bodies, or assembly mates. The `execute_code` tool compensates, but it requires the AI to generate correct FreeCAD Python API calls.

**Visual feedback only.** `get_view` captures viewport screenshots, but there's no structured way to query geometry dimensions, constraints, or topology. The AI sees the model visually but can't programmatically inspect it in detail.

A second FreeCAD server ([lucygoodchild/freecad-mcp-server](https://github.com/lucygoodchild/freecad-mcp-server), 5 stars, TypeScript) offers 7 tools with explicit boolean operations (union, cut, common) and primitive creation (box, cylinder, sphere) — more structured but less adopted.

### Fusion 360

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| [JustusBraitinger/Autodesk-Fusion-360-MCP-Server](https://github.com/JustusBraitinger/Autodesk-Fusion-360-MCP-Server) | 19 | Python | 30+ |
| [Joe-Spencer/fusion-mcp-server](https://github.com/Joe-Spencer/fusion-mcp-server) | 27 | Python | 3 |

Two Fusion 360 MCP servers with very different approaches:

**JustusBraitinger's server** (19 stars, Python, MIT) is the more capable. Thirty-plus tools across four categories: sketching & creation (10 tools — lines, circles, arcs, rectangles, splines, extrude, revolve), feature & modification (11 tools — fillet, chamfer, shell, mirror, pattern, combine, split), analysis & control (6 tools — mass properties, interference check, measure), and export (2 tools — STEP, STL). Uses an event-driven task queue to handle Fusion 360's non-thread-safe API, allowing asynchronous MCP requests to execute sequentially on the main UI thread. This is a genuine "conversational CAD" proof of concept.

**Joe-Spencer's server** (27 stars, Python, GPL-3.0) has only 3 tools — `message_box`, `create_new_sketch`, `create_parameter`. Early-stage, but the higher star count suggests interest in the concept.

Neither is official — Autodesk has not published an MCP server for any of its products.

### SolidWorks

| Server | Stars | Language | License |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| [eyfel/mcp-server-solidworks](https://github.com/eyfel/mcp-server-solidworks) | ~67 | Python/C# | MIT |

**SolidPilot** — an open-source AI assistant for SolidWorks with a four-layer architecture: Claude UI → Python prompt generation → C# version-aware adapter → COM bridge via PythonNET. The version-aware design is thoughtful — SolidWorks COM APIs change between versions, and the C# adapter layer handles those differences.

Currently more of an architectural framework than a fully-featured tool — the COM bridge pattern is solid, but the tool surface is limited. SolidWorks' proprietary nature and COM-based API make MCP integration inherently harder than with open-source tools.

Two other SolidWorks servers exist: [vespo92/SolidworksMCP-TS](https://github.com/vespo92/SolidworksMCP-TS) (TypeScript, dynamic VBA macro generation) and an espocorp variant (VBA script generation, batch operations, drawing automation).

### Onshape

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [BLamy/onshape-mcp](https://github.com/BLamy/onshape-mcp) | ~11 stars |
| License | MIT |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Commits | 1 |

Minimal but architecturally interesting — Onshape's cloud-native, browser-based CAD platform has a comprehensive REST API, making it the easiest commercial CAD platform to integrate with MCP. Only 1 commit and 11 stars signal this is early proof-of-concept. Onshape's API-first design makes it the strongest candidate for a future official vendor MCP server.

## 2D Drafting (AutoCAD)

### CAD-MCP

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [daobataotie/CAD-MCP](https://github.com/daobataotie/CAD-MCP) | ~270 stars |
| License | MIT |
| Language | Python |
| Functions | 10 |

The most popular AutoCAD-family MCP server. Controls **AutoCAD, GstarCAD, and ZWCAD** through natural language commands. Ten drawing functions: `draw_line`, `draw_circle`, `draw_arc`, `draw_polyline`, `draw_rectangle`, `draw_text`, `draw_hatch`, `add_dimension`, `save_drawing`, `process_command`. Layer management and color recognition included.

The multi-CAD support is the differentiator — GstarCAD and ZWCAD are popular AutoCAD alternatives in China and other markets, and this server works across all three. Simple drawing operations only — no block editing, attribute management, or xref handling.

### AutoCAD MCP (puran-water)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [puran-water/autocad-mcp](https://github.com/puran-water/autocad-mcp) | ~177 stars |
| License | MIT |
| Language | Python (71.4%), Common Lisp (28.6%) |
| Tools | 8 |

The most architecturally sophisticated AutoCAD MCP server. Eight consolidated tools: `drawing`, `entity`, `layer`, `block`, `annotation`, `pid`, `view`, `system`.

### What Works Well

**Dual backend architecture.** File IPC for Windows + live AutoCAD sessions (JSON files + keystroke messaging via `PostMessageW(WM_CHAR)`), or ezdxf for headless DXF processing. This means you can automate a running AutoCAD instance or process DXF files without AutoCAD installed.

**Focus-free dispatch.** The IPC mechanism uses `PostMessageW` to trigger AutoLISP commands without stealing window focus — a genuine engineering detail that matters for production use where AutoCAD is one of many windows.

**P&ID symbol library.** Built-in support for Piping and Instrumentation Diagram symbols following ISA standards. Niche but valuable for process engineering workflows.

**Undo/redo support.** Proper state management for reversible operations.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**Windows-only for live AutoCAD.** The File IPC backend uses Win32 APIs. The ezdxf backend works cross-platform but only for offline DXF processing.

**AutoLISP complexity.** The 28.6% Common Lisp codebase means contributors need AutoLISP expertise, limiting community growth.

## Electronic Design (KiCad)

### KiCad MCP (lamaalrajih)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [lamaalrajih/kicad-mcp](https://github.com/lamaalrajih/kicad-mcp) | ~405 stars |
| License | MIT |
| Language | Python |
| Platform | macOS, Windows, Linux |

The most popular KiCad MCP server. Provides AI-assisted PCB design with netlist extraction from schematics, BOM generation and analysis, design rule checking (DRC) with progress tracking, PCB visualization and rendering, and automatic circuit pattern recognition. Cross-platform support.

The 405-star count — high for an EDA tool — shows strong interest in AI-assisted electronics design. PCB layout is one of those tasks where AI guidance could genuinely help: component placement suggestions, routing hints, and DRC violation explanations are all natural language-friendly.

### KiCad MCP (Seeed Studio)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [Seeed-Studio/kicad-mcp-server](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/kicad-mcp-server) | ~20 stars |
| Language | Python |
| Tools | 39 |
| KiCad version | 7.0+ (9.0 recommended) |

From Seeed Studio (a major hardware prototyping company), this server has the most tools (39) of any KiCad MCP server, organized into seven categories: analysis (3), validation (6), pin analysis (3), code generation (12), editing (2), project management (1), and supporting utilities.

The standout is the **code generation category** — 12 tools that generate embedded development code directly from schematics. Device tree generation for embedded Linux, HAL initialization code, pin configuration — this bridges the schematic-to-firmware gap that's traditionally manual. Supports 6+ MCU families. Headless operation via kicad-cli makes it Docker-friendly.

Two other KiCad servers exist: [mixelpixx/KiCAD-MCP-Server](https://github.com/mixelpixx/KiCAD-MCP-Server) (PCB design automation) and [circuit-synth/mcp-kicad-sch-api](https://github.com/circuit-synth/mcp-kicad-sch-api) (schematic manipulation for AI agents).

## The bottom line

CAD and 3D modeling MCP servers span every major platform, but adoption is concentrated in two camps: **Blender for 3D art/visualization** (17,800 stars) and **open-source engineering tools** (FreeCAD at 617, KiCad at 405). The commercial CAD side is entirely community-driven — no official servers from Autodesk, Dassault, Siemens, or PTC.

**Best for 3D modeling/art:** Blender MCP (17,800 stars, full scene control, asset ecosystem)
**Best for parametric CAD:** FreeCAD MCP (617 stars, parts library, remote operation)
**Best for PCB design:** KiCad MCP (405 stars, netlist/BOM/DRC) or Seeed Studio's KiCad MCP (39 tools, code generation)
**Best for AutoCAD:** puran-water/autocad-mcp (177 stars, dual backends, P&ID, undo/redo)
**Best for Fusion 360:** JustusBraitinger's server (30+ tools, full sketching/feature/export)
**Best for text-to-3D:** OpenSCAD MCP (135 stars, AI-generated models, direct printing)

Rating: **3.5/5** — The breadth is impressive: every major CAD platform has at least one MCP server. Blender MCP's 17,800 stars prove massive demand for AI-assisted 3D work. The open-source CAD and EDA tools (FreeCAD, KiCad, OpenSCAD) have strong community servers. But most engineering CAD servers are early-stage with limited tools and minimal adoption. The absence of any official vendor server from the big four (Autodesk, Dassault, Siemens, PTC) means the most widely-used commercial CAD platforms have only community integrations. Fusion 360 and Onshape's API-first architectures make them the most likely candidates for official MCP support — if the vendors decide AI-assisted design is worth investing in.
