**At a glance:** AWS publishes **68 official MCP servers** in [awslabs/mcp](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp) (8,540 stars, Apache 2.0) — the largest MCP server collection from any single organization. Servers cover databases (DynamoDB, Neptune, Redshift), compute (ECS, EKS, Lambda), security (IAM, Well-Architected), cost management, and more. MCP client support exists in Amazon Q Developer (CLI + IDE plugins) and Bedrock AgentCore. Part of our **[AI Providers MCP category](/categories/ai-providers/)**.

AWS has taken a **go-wide infrastructure approach** to MCP, treating it as a protocol for connecting AI agents to cloud services. Rather than wrapping a single API, AWS built dozens of purpose-specific servers — each one a gateway to a different AWS service. This reflects AWS's core business: they don't sell models (though Bedrock hosts nearly 100), they sell the infrastructure those models connect to.

[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) is the world's largest cloud provider. **AWS 2025 revenue: $128.7 billion** (+20% YoY), with a **$142 billion annualized run rate**. AWS holds approximately **30-32% cloud market share** (ahead of Azure at ~20% and Google Cloud at ~13%). Amazon overall: approximately **$2.2 trillion market cap**, approximately **1,576,000 employees** (AWS: ~139,000). AWS is an **AAIF Platinum member** — joining at the foundation's December 2025 launch alongside Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, Block, Bloomberg, and Cloudflare.

**Architecture note:** AWS's MCP strategy is the most **infrastructure-centric** of any AI provider. Where Anthropic created the protocol, Google published 24+ servers for its cloud, and OpenAI focused on client integration, AWS published **68 servers** covering virtually every major AWS service — turning MCP into the universal agent-to-cloud interface.

AWS is one of the most comprehensive MCP client implementors, spanning developer tools (Q Developer), managed AI services (Bedrock Agents), and infrastructure (Lambda, AgentCore).

### Bedrock AgentCore

AgentCore, announced in early 2026, is AWS's platform for deploying and managing AI agents with native MCP support:

- **AgentCore Gateway** — centralized MCP tool server; agents discover and invoke MCP tools through a unified interface
- **AgentCore Runtime** — deploys MCP servers in managed infrastructure with stateful session support (dedicated microVMs, announced March 10, 2026)
- Supports elicitation, sampling, and progress notifications for MCP sessions

## Known Issues

1. **238 open issues** — The monorepo's issue count reflects the breadth of 68 servers. Active maintenance is a double-edged sword: frequent releases (185 total) mean frequent dependency changes and potential breakage.

2. **stdio only** — SSE transport was removed in May 2025, and Streamable HTTP is not yet available. This limits deployment options for remote/hosted MCP server scenarios outside of AgentCore.

3. **OpenAPI MCP Server broken** — Issue [#2533](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/issues/2533): all published versions fail to start due to fastmcp 3.x incompatibility with no version constraint. Indicates dependency management challenges in a large monorepo.

4. **AWS Documentation server slow** — Issue [#2435](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/issues/2435): `aws-documentation-mcp-server` takes 3.24 seconds to load vs typical sub-1-second for other servers.

5. **Windows compatibility issues** — Issue [#1307](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/issues/1307): `aws-msk-mcp-server` fails on Windows/Cursor ("No tools, prompts, or resources"). Cross-platform support varies by server.

6. **Deprecated servers** — Several servers (Cloud Control API, CDK, Terraform) are marked deprecated with recommendations to use alternatives, creating confusion about which server to use for a given service.

7. **Cloud billing required** — Most servers interact with AWS services that require an active AWS account with billing. Unlike Google's free API tier or Meta's free models, there's no zero-cost path for most MCP server usage.

8. **No Bedrock API wrapper** — While AWS publishes 68 servers for AWS *services*, there's no official MCP server that wraps the Bedrock API itself for model inference. Developers wanting to call Bedrock models via MCP need community solutions.

9. **AgentCore is new** — AgentCore Runtime's stateful MCP support was announced March 2026. As a new product, expect rapid changes, limited documentation, and potential breaking changes during preview.

10. **Monorepo complexity** — 68 servers in one repository means navigating a large codebase. Individual servers vary in maturity, documentation quality, and maintenance frequency.

## Bottom Line

**Rating: 4.5 out of 5**

AWS has built the **most extensive MCP server infrastructure** of any company. With 68 official servers covering virtually every major AWS service, AAIF Platinum membership, and MCP client support across Amazon Q Developer and Bedrock AgentCore, AWS treats MCP as the standard interface between AI agents and cloud infrastructure.

The **infrastructure-centric approach** is uniquely AWS. While Anthropic created the protocol and Google published 24+ servers, AWS went further — 68 servers, a Lambda runtime for hosting MCP servers, a proxy for SigV4 authentication, and AgentCore for managed MCP server deployment. This isn't just MCP support; it's MCP as a first-class cloud primitive.

The **4.5/5 rating** — the highest in this AI provider series — reflects the sheer breadth and depth of AWS's MCP investment. No other company comes close to 68 official servers. The community ecosystem (714 repos) is also the largest. Amazon Q Developer's MCP client support across CLI and four IDE platforms is comprehensive. And AgentCore represents the industry's first managed MCP server infrastructure.

What keeps it from 5/5: the monorepo has 238 open issues, stdio-only transport limits remote deployment, there's no Bedrock inference wrapper, several servers are deprecated, and the rapid pace of 185 releases risks stability. Cloud billing requirements also mean there's no free experimentation path for most servers.

**Who benefits most from AWS's MCP ecosystem:**

- **AWS-native teams** — If your infrastructure runs on AWS, these 68 servers give your AI agents direct access to every service: databases, compute, security, cost management, and more
- **Enterprise architects** — AgentCore provides managed MCP server infrastructure with SigV4 auth, IAM integration, and stateful sessions — the kind of enterprise-grade agent tooling that other providers don't yet offer
- **Agent builders** — Amazon Q Developer's MCP client across CLI and IDE, combined with Bedrock's nearly 100 models and Agents framework, creates a complete agent development stack

**Who should be cautious:**

- **Multi-cloud teams** — These servers are AWS-specific; there's no abstraction layer for Azure or GCP equivalents
- **Cost-sensitive experiments** — Unlike Meta's free models or Google's free API tier, most AWS MCP servers require active AWS billing; experimentation costs real money
- **Teams wanting model-level MCP access** — There's no official Bedrock inference MCP server; the 68 servers connect to AWS services, not to Bedrock model endpoints directly
