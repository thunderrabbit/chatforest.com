Framelink is what happens when the community builds a better solution before the platform owner shows up. With 13,700 GitHub stars — 34x more than Figma's official guide repo — it's become the de facto standard for design-to-code MCP workflows. And for good reason: it produces better output for the most common use case.

The server does one thing well: it reads Figma designs and gives your AI assistant descriptive data about layouts, styles, and component structure. Instead of prescriptive React + Tailwind code (Figma's approach), Framelink sends descriptive JSON — "this element has a 1px border and 16px padding" — and lets your AI decide how to build it using your existing components and conventions.

The result: more accurate code that fits your project, not Figma's default assumptions.

## What It Does

Two tools:

- **`get_figma_data`** — fetches the structure, styling, and layout of a Figma file, frame, or group from a pasted link. Before responding, the server simplifies and filters the raw Figma API response to include only relevant layout and styling information. This context reduction is the key architectural decision — less data means more accurate AI responses.

- **`download_figma_images`** — downloads SVG and PNG image assets from a Figma file based on node IDs. Still marked as work-in-progress.

That's it. Two tools. Compare that to the [official Figma MCP](/reviews/figma-dev-mode-mcp-server/)'s 12 tools. But tool count isn't the metric that matters here — output quality is.

## Setup

Install via npx:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "framelink-figma": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "figma-developer-mcp", "--figma-api-key=YOUR-KEY", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

On Windows, wrap with `cmd /c`. You need a Figma personal access token — any Figma account, including free. No OAuth flow, no browser popup.

Supports: Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Cline, VS Code, Zed, Amp, Codex, Roo, OpenCode, Antigravity — basically every IDE that supports MCP.

## What's Good

**Descriptive output beats prescriptive output.** When Figma's official server sends `<div className="flex gap-4 p-6 bg-white rounded-xl">`, your AI copies that structure — even if your project uses Vue, Svelte, or a different CSS approach. When Framelink sends `{layout: "horizontal", gap: 16, padding: 24, background: "#fff", borderRadius: 12}`, your AI generates code that matches your project's conventions. This is a fundamental architectural advantage.

**Component nesting is preserved.** The official Figma server flattens component hierarchies. A card containing a button comes through as a flat structure. Framelink preserves the nesting, so your AI generates composable components instead of monoliths. For projects with existing component libraries, this is critical.

**~25% smaller payloads.** Descriptive JSON is inherently more compact than generated React code. Smaller payloads mean less context window consumption, which means more accurate AI responses and lower token costs.

**Works with any Figma account.** No Dev seat required, no paid plan needed. Standard Figma API rate limits apply instead of the official server's 6-calls-per-month free tier cap. This alone makes Framelink the obvious choice for individual developers and small teams.

**11,500+ weekly npm downloads.** Real adoption, not just GitHub stars. Active maintenance with 17 releases, latest v0.6.6 (March 4, 2026). TypeScript codebase with Vitest testing, ESLint, and Release Please automation.

**Framework agnostic.** HTML, CSS, React, Vue, Svelte, iOS, Android — the descriptive output works with anything. No framework assumptions baked in.

## What's Not

**Only two tools — and one is WIP.** `download_figma_images` is still marked work-in-progress. That leaves `get_figma_data` doing all the heavy lifting. No design token extraction, no Code Connect, no code-to-canvas capture.

**Figma API rate limits hit hard.** Multiple reports of 429 "Too Many Requests" errors (#258, #259, #287). When your AI agent makes rapid successive calls to inspect different frames, Figma's API throttles you. The official Figma server presumably has better rate limit management as a first-party integration.

**No write operations.** Framelink is read-only. You can't push code back to Figma as editable designs, manage Code Connect mappings, or generate FigJam diagrams. If you need the design-code-design loop, the [official server](/reviews/figma-dev-mode-mcp-server/) is your only option.

**macOS ARM compatibility issue.** The sharp/libvips image library causes dlopen errors on Apple Silicon when run via npx (#288). This is a dependency issue, not a code issue, but it blocks some users.

**Stdio-only transport.** No remote hosted server, no Streamable HTTP. Every developer needs to install and run it locally. Compare this to Figma's zero-install remote server at `mcp.figma.com/mcp`.

**No proxy support.** Users behind corporate proxies report connection reset errors (#267). The server doesn't support HTTP proxy configuration for its Figma API calls.

**API key via command-line arg.** The `--figma-api-key=YOUR-KEY` approach puts your token in shell history and process lists. Environment variable support exists (`FIGMA_API_KEY`), but the documented default is the CLI arg.

## How It Compares

The real comparison is Framelink vs. the [official Figma Dev Mode MCP](/reviews/figma-dev-mode-mcp-server/):

| Feature | Framelink | Figma Official MCP |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **GitHub stars** | 13,700 | 403 (guide repo) |
| **Tools** | 2 | 12 |
| **Output format** | Descriptive JSON | Prescriptive React/Tailwind |
| **Component nesting** | Preserved | Flattened |
| **Response size** | ~25% smaller | Larger |
| **Transport** | Stdio (npx) | Remote HTTP |
| **Auth** | API key | OAuth (browser) |
| **Free tier** | Figma API limits | 6 calls/month |
| **Write operations** | No | Yes (code-to-canvas, diagrams) |
| **Code Connect** | No | Yes |
| **Self-hostable** | Yes (MIT) | No |
| **Maintenance** | 179 commits, 17 releases | Closed source |

They complement rather than compete. Framelink wins on the most common workflow (read design → generate code). The official server wins on unique capabilities (code-to-canvas, Code Connect, design tokens).

Other Figma MCP servers exist — GitHub has 221+ Figma MCP repos — but none approach Framelink's adoption or maturity. The closest community alternative is thirdstrandstudio/mcp-figma, which offers full Figma API coverage but lacks Framelink's context reduction that makes AI output more accurate.

## The Bigger Picture

Framelink's success proves that in the MCP ecosystem, the best server isn't always the one with the most tools — it's the one with the best tool design. Two tools that produce clean, framework-agnostic output beat twelve tools that produce framework-specific code you'll rewrite anyway.

The "descriptive vs. prescriptive" design decision is the most consequential architectural choice in the design-to-code MCP space. Framelink bets that AI assistants are smart enough to translate design intent into code; Figma bets that AI assistants work better with explicit code examples. Based on adoption numbers (13,700 stars vs. 403), the community has voted.

The commercial potential is interesting: Framelink.ai has a waitlist for "special features coming soon." Whether that means a hosted remote server, premium tools, or design system integrations, it signals that this project may evolve beyond a pure open-source tool. That's worth watching — a community server becoming a commercial product could change the value proposition.

For now, if you're doing design-to-code work with AI agents, Framelink is the starting point. Add the official server only if you need its exclusive write capabilities and have a paid Figma plan.

## Rating: 4/5

Framelink earns a 4/5 for producing objectively better code output than the official Figma MCP server for the most common design-to-code workflow — descriptive JSON that respects your project's conventions, preserved component hierarchies, ~25% smaller payloads, and zero cost barriers. It loses a point for having only two tools (one WIP), no write operations, no remote hosted server, Figma API rate limiting issues, and stdio-only transport that requires local installation. Despite these gaps, 13,700 GitHub stars and 11,500 weekly npm downloads make it the most adopted design-to-code MCP server by a wide margin.

**Use this if:** You want to translate Figma designs into code using your AI assistant, regardless of your Figma plan tier, framework choice, or component library.

**Skip this if:** You need the full design-code-design loop (code-to-canvas, Code Connect), you need a zero-install remote server, or your network requires proxy support.
