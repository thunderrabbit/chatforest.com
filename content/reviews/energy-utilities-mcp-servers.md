card_description: "Energy and utilities MCP servers for power system simulation, building energy modeling, industrial IoT/SCADA, commodity pricing, carbon tracking, and smart home energy management. This category stands out for its depth of scientific and engineering tooling — PowerMCP (88 stars) integrates 9 different power system simulators (PowerWorld, OpenDSS, PSSE, PyPSA, pandapower, ANDES, Egret, LTSpice, PSLF) into a unified MCP interface, making it one of the most ambitious multi-software MCP projects in any category. EnergyPlus MCP (69 stars) from Lawrence Berkeley National Lab provides 35 tools for complete building energy simulation lifecycle management — load, validate, modify, simulate, and visualize — with HVAC topology analysis and smart output variable discovery. PyPSA MCP (49 stars) enables natural-language energy system modeling with 13 tools for creating buses, generators, loads, storage, and running power flow optimization. The IoT-Edge MCP Server (20 stars) bridges AI agents to industrial SCADA/PLC systems via MQTT and Modbus protocols with multi-priority alarm management and security-first design. EnergyAtIt (30+ tools) covers battery dispatch, carbon verification, and grid meter reading across 8 industrial protocols (IEC 61850, DNP3, Modbus, OpenADR, OCPP, IEEE 2030.5, ICCP/TASE.2). OilpriceAPI provides real-time pricing for 40+ energy commodities. Climatiq MCP enables carbon emission calculations across electricity, transportation, cloud computing, freight, and procurement. Gaps: no utility billing/customer management MCP servers; no DERMS (Distributed Energy Resource Management) integration; no real-time grid operator (ISO/RTO) market data feeds; no EV charging network management beyond OCPP protocol support; no weather-to-energy forecasting (solar irradiance, wind speed to MWh); no AMI/smart meter data access. The category earns 3.5/5 — impressive scientific depth with PowerMCP and EnergyPlus leading the way, but the gap between research/simulation tools and operational utility systems remains wide."

Energy and utilities MCP servers are enabling AI agents to simulate power grids, optimize building energy consumption, monitor industrial equipment, track carbon emissions, and access real-time commodity markets — all through natural language. Instead of manually configuring power system simulators or writing SCADA integration code, an AI agent can create an energy system model, run power flow analysis, or dispatch a battery storage system through standardized MCP tools.

The landscape spans six areas: **power system simulation** (PowerMCP, PyPSA — multi-simulator integration for grid analysis), **building energy** (EnergyPlus MCP — 35-tool simulation lifecycle from Lawrence Berkeley National Lab), **industrial IoT/SCADA** (IoT-Edge — MQTT/Modbus protocol bridging for PLC systems), **energy infrastructure** (EnergyAtIt — battery dispatch, carbon verification, grid meters across 8 protocols), **commodity markets** (OilpriceAPI — real-time oil, gas, and commodity pricing), and **carbon & sustainability** (Climatiq — emission calculations across electricity, travel, cloud, freight).

The headline findings: **PowerMCP is the most ambitious multi-software integration** — 9 power system simulators unified under one MCP interface, enabling AI agents to coordinate across PowerWorld, OpenDSS, PSSE, and more. **EnergyPlus MCP has the most tools** at 35, covering the complete building energy simulation lifecycle with HVAC topology analysis. **The industrial IoT gap is closing** — IoT-Edge bridges AI agents to real SCADA/PLC systems via MQTT and Modbus with production-grade security. **Carbon tracking is accessible** — Climatiq provides 10 tools for emission calculations across multiple domains. **Operational utility systems remain underserved** — no billing, no DERMS, no ISO/RTO market feeds, no AMI/smart meter access.

## Power System Simulation

### PowerMCP

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [Power-Agent/PowerMCP](https://github.com/Power-Agent/PowerMCP) | 88 | Python | MIT | 9 integrations |

The **most ambitious power system MCP project** — a collection of MCP servers that bridge AI agents to 9 different power system simulation tools:

- **PowerWorld** — commercial power flow and stability analysis
- **OpenDSS** — distribution system simulation (open source, EPRI)
- **PSSE** — Siemens PTI power system simulator
- **PyPSA** — Python for Power System Analysis (open source)
- **pandapower** — power system modeling and analysis (open source)
- **ANDES** — dynamic simulation and symbolic modeling
- **Egret** — EGRET optimization (Sandia National Labs)
- **LTSpice** — circuit simulation (Analog Devices)
- **PSLF** — GE Positive Sequence Load Flow

Each simulator gets its own MCP server file, configured through a shared `config.json`. This modular architecture lets users expose only the simulators they have installed — important since PowerWorld, PSSE, and PSLF are commercial software requiring licenses.

The project is research-oriented (contributors from academic/national lab backgrounds) with 88 stars and 94 commits. It's the only MCP project that attempts to unify the fragmented power systems software ecosystem under a single AI-accessible interface. The trade-off is that each integration's depth varies — some simulators have more complete tool coverage than others.

### PyPSA MCP

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [cdgaete/pypsa-mcp](https://github.com/cdgaete/pypsa-mcp) | 49 | Python | MIT | 13 |

A focused MCP server for **PyPSA energy system modeling** through natural language. 13 tools organized into four categories:

- **Model management (4 tools)** — create, list, delete, export model summaries
- **Component creation (5 tools)** — add buses, generators, loads, transmission lines, storage units
- **Data/simulation (3 tools)** — time snapshots, power flow analysis, optimization
- **Analysis** — results extraction and metric computation

Install via `pip install pypsamcp`. Built on FastMCP for protocol implementation. This is complementary to PowerMCP — where PowerMCP provides breadth across simulators, PyPSA MCP provides depth within one tool. For teams already using PyPSA, this is the more practical choice. 49 stars and active development (latest commits March 2026).

## Building Energy Simulation

### EnergyPlus MCP (Lawrence Berkeley National Lab)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [LBNL-ETA/EnergyPlus-MCP](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/EnergyPlus-MCP) | 69 | Python | — | 35 |

The **most comprehensive building energy simulation MCP server**, developed by the Energy Technologies Area at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 35 tools across 5 categories:

- **Model Config & Loading (9 tools)** — IDF file loading, validation, file management, simulation settings
- **Model Inspection (9 tools)** — zone analysis, surface details, materials, schedules, occupancy, lighting, equipment loads
- **Model Modification (8 tools)** — parameter updates, infiltration changes, window films, coatings, output configuration
- **Simulation & Results (4 tools)** — execution, visualization, HVAC loop discovery and topology analysis
- **Server Management (5 tools)** — system status, logging, diagram generation

EnergyPlus is the DOE's flagship building energy simulation engine, used by architects and engineers worldwide to model heating, cooling, lighting, ventilation, and other energy flows. This MCP server makes the complete simulation lifecycle accessible to AI agents — from loading an IDF model to running simulations and generating visualizations.

Supports Docker-based deployment for Claude Desktop, VS Code, and Cursor, plus local development with Python 3.10+ and EnergyPlus 25.1.0. The HVAC topology analysis is particularly notable — AI agents can discover and analyze complex HVAC loop configurations that would normally require deep domain expertise to navigate.

## Industrial IoT & SCADA

### IoT-Edge MCP Server

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [poly-mcp/IoT-Edge-MCP-Server](https://github.com/poly-mcp/IoT-Edge-MCP-Server) | 20 | Python | — | 11 categories |

A **production-ready MCP server for Industrial IoT, SCADA, and PLC systems** that unifies MQTT sensors, Modbus devices, and industrial equipment into a single AI-orchestrable API:

- **Protocol support** — MQTT publish/subscribe and Modbus TCP/RTU for communicating with industrial controllers
- **Time-series storage** — InfluxDB 2.x integration for historical sensor data with aggregation queries
- **Caching** — Redis layer for high-frequency sensor reads
- **Alarm management** — multi-priority system with acknowledgment workflows
- **Security** — API key + JWT authentication, IP allowlisting, input validation, Fernet encryption, HMAC signatures, tamper-evident audit logging

11 tool categories covering sensor reading (single/batch/historical), actuator commands, device topology, alarm management, Modbus register and coil operations, health checks, and real-time monitoring. Includes a simulation mode that requires no external dependencies — useful for development and testing.

This is the bridge between AI agents and the physical world of industrial energy systems. The security-first design (encryption, audit logging, IP allowlisting) reflects the reality that SCADA systems control critical infrastructure. Designed to work with PolyMCP for multi-server orchestration.

## Energy Infrastructure

### EnergyAtIt MCP Server

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [kasathur/energyatit-mcp-server](https://github.com/kasathur/energyatit-mcp-server) | 0 | JavaScript | MIT | 30+ |

An ambitious **energy infrastructure MCP server** with 30+ tools for managing distributed energy resources across 8 industrial protocols:

- **Protocols** — IEC 61850, DNP3, Modbus TCP/RTU, OpenADR 2.0b, OCPP 1.6/2.0, IEEE 2030.5, ICCP/TASE.2, REST
- **Asset management** — list sites, list assets, track reliability metrics
- **Battery dispatch** — send dispatch commands to battery storage systems
- **Carbon verification** — create carbon records, verify chain of custody, generate certificates
- **Demand response** — create, dispatch, and settle DR events via OpenADR
- **Grid monitoring** — capacity checks, meter readings, real-time pricing
- **Compliance** — generate compliance packages, Scope 2 reports
- **Sandbox** — provision isolated test environments

Install via `npx energyatit-mcp-server`. Despite zero GitHub stars, the protocol breadth is impressive — covering everything from substation automation (IEC 61850) to EV charger management (OCPP) to utility demand response (OpenADR). The 8-protocol coverage makes this potentially useful for utilities and energy aggregators managing diverse equipment fleets, though the low adoption suggests it needs more real-world validation.

### EcoAILab Energy MCP Server

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [ecoailab/energy-mcp-server](https://github.com/ecoailab/energy-mcp-server) | 0 | Python | MIT | — |

An energy systems MCP server for **simulation, optimization, and forecasting** with AI coding assistants. Integrates external data sources via API keys:

- **KEPCO** — Korean Electric Power Corporation data
- **KMA** — Korea Meteorological Administration weather data
- **Electricity Maps** — real-time carbon intensity by region

From the EcoAI Lab at Hanbat National University (South Korea). Currently at version 0.1.0 with only 3 installs reported. The regional focus on Korean energy data makes it niche but potentially valuable for energy researchers working with Korean grid data. Early-stage — documentation and tool count are limited.

## Commodity Markets

### OilpriceAPI MCP Server

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [OilpriceAPI/mcp-server](https://github.com/OilpriceAPI/mcp-server) | 1 | TypeScript | MIT | 4 |

**Real-time oil, gas, and commodity pricing** for AI agents. 4 tools:

- `get_commodity_price` — current pricing for a specific commodity
- `get_market_overview` — multi-commodity prices with category filtering
- `compare_prices` — side-by-side analysis for 2-5 commodities
- `list_commodities` — catalog of 40+ available commodities and codes

Covers oil (WTI, Brent, OPEC basket), natural gas (Henry Hub, EU TTF), coal, refined products, metals, and forex. Also provides 4 subscribable resources for price snapshots and 4 pre-built analyst prompt templates for market analysis workflows.

Install via `npx oilpriceapi-mcp` — requires an OilpriceAPI key. Updated March 2026 (v1.2.0). The natural language commodity recognition is a nice touch — agents can query "what's the price of Brent crude" without knowing commodity codes.

## Carbon & Sustainability

### Climatiq MCP Server

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [jagan-shanmugam/climatiq-mcp-server](https://github.com/jagan-shanmugam/climatiq-mcp-server) | 8 | Python | MIT | 10 |

A **carbon emission calculation** MCP server built on the Climatiq API. 10 tools covering:

- **Electricity emissions** — calculate carbon from energy consumption by region
- **Travel emissions** — car, plane, train carbon footprint
- **Cloud computing emissions** — AWS, GCP, Azure workload carbon impact
- **Freight emissions** — shipping and logistics carbon tracking
- **Procurement emissions** — spend-based carbon calculation
- **Hotel stay emissions** — hospitality carbon footprint
- **Emission factor search** — browse Climatiq's database of emission factors

Requires a Climatiq API key. Install via `uv pip install climatiq-mcp-server`. This fills an important niche — as companies face increasing ESG reporting requirements, the ability for AI agents to automatically calculate and track carbon emissions across multiple domains (energy, travel, procurement, cloud) through a single MCP interface is genuinely useful. 8 stars suggests early but real adoption.

## Smart Home Energy (Adjacent)

### Home Assistant MCP Servers

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [tevonsb/homeassistant-mcp](https://github.com/tevonsb/homeassistant-mcp) | 555 | TypeScript | MIT | Multiple |

The **most popular smart home MCP server** at 555 stars, enabling AI agents to control and monitor Home Assistant devices through natural language. While not energy-specific, Home Assistant's energy dashboard integration means these MCP servers can access energy consumption data, solar production metrics, and grid import/export tracking.

Multiple implementations exist (tevonsb, homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp, amattas, jango-blockchained/advanced-homeassistant-mcp, Coolver), with the original at 555 stars leading adoption. Features include device control across lights, climate, covers, switches, sensors, media players, real-time SSE updates, automation management, and add-on/HACS support.

For energy monitoring specifically, the advanced-homeassistant-mcp variant adds usage pattern analysis and energy monitoring capabilities. The practical use case: AI agents that can optimize home energy consumption by correlating utility rate schedules, solar production, and device usage patterns.

## What's Missing

The energy & utilities MCP landscape has notable gaps:

- **Utility billing and customer management** — no MCP servers for utility CIS (Customer Information Systems), billing engines, or rate schedule management
- **DERMS** — no Distributed Energy Resource Management System integration for coordinating solar, storage, and demand response at scale
- **ISO/RTO market data** — no real-time feeds from grid operators (CAISO, PJM, ERCOT, MISO) for electricity market prices, LMPs, or congestion data
- **AMI/smart meter** — no Advanced Metering Infrastructure data access for granular consumption analytics
- **Weather-to-energy forecasting** — no solar irradiance or wind speed to energy production prediction
- **EV charging networks** — limited to OCPP protocol support; no ChargePoint, Tesla Supercharger, or Electrify America API integration
- **Grid resilience** — no outage management, vegetation management, or asset health monitoring
- **Nuclear and hydroelectric** — no simulation or monitoring tools for these generation types

## The Bottom Line

Energy & utilities MCP servers are strongest in **scientific simulation and research** — PowerMCP's 9-simulator integration and EnergyPlus's 35-tool lifecycle from LBNL are world-class. The **industrial IoT bridge** (IoT-Edge) and **carbon tracking** (Climatiq) fill practical operational needs. Commodity pricing (OilpriceAPI) covers market data.

The gap is between research and operations. Power engineers can model grids through AI agents, but utility operators can't manage billing, outages, or customer communications. Energy traders can check commodity prices but can't access ISO/RTO market data. Building engineers can simulate energy use but can't connect to real building management systems.

This category earns **3.5/5** — impressive depth in power system simulation and building energy modeling, with promising industrial IoT and carbon tracking tools, but the operational utility and grid management side remains largely unserved. The research tools are ready for production use; the operational tools are still catching up.
