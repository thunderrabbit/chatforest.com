Content delivery networks are the invisible backbone of the modern web — **caching, routing, edge compute, security, and performance optimization**. CDN & edge computing MCP servers let AI agents manage these systems directly: purging caches, deploying edge workers, analyzing traffic patterns, configuring domains, and monitoring performance metrics.

The headline finding: **CDN MCP coverage is vendor-driven and uneven**. Cloudflare dominates with multiple official servers totaling 3,500+ stars and a novel Code Mode architecture that maps 2,500 API endpoints into ~1,000 tokens. Fastly ships a polished official MCP server in Go with smart security design. Akamai has no official MCP server but community options reach impressive scale (191 tools). Smaller CDN providers (Bunny, KeyCDN, StackPath) have zero MCP presence. The pattern is clear: MCP adoption correlates directly with developer-platform ambitions.

## The Landscape

### Cloudflare

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [cloudflare/mcp](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp) | ~263 | TypeScript | 2 (Code Mode) | stdio |
| [cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare) | ~3,500 | TypeScript | 16 servers | stdio |
| [cloudflare/workers-mcp](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-mcp) | — | TypeScript | varies | stdio |

**Cloudflare has the most extensive CDN MCP ecosystem by a wide margin.** Three distinct approaches, each serving different use cases.

**cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare** (3,500 stars, Apache-2.0) is the original and most popular option — 16 separate MCP servers covering Workers bindings, observability, Radar analytics, containers, browser rendering, logging, AI Gateway, AutoRAG, audit logs, DNS analytics, digital experience monitoring, CASB security, and GraphQL APIs. 349 commits, 295 releases, last updated March 2026. This is comprehensive but token-heavy — each server loads its own tool definitions.

**cloudflare/mcp** (263 stars, Apache-2.0) is the newer, architecturally interesting option: **Code Mode**. Instead of defining hundreds of individual tools, it exposes just 2 tools (`search` and `execute`) that let AI agents query API specifications server-side and generate execution code. The result: 2,500 Cloudflare API endpoints accessible in ~1,000 tokens of context, compared to ~977% context utilization for raw OpenAPI specs. This is a genuinely novel approach to the "too many tools" problem that plagues large API surfaces. Supports OAuth authentication (recommended) or API tokens, with automatic account ID detection.

**cloudflare/workers-mcp** acts as a proxy between local MCP clients and Cloudflare Workers, letting you expose Worker functions directly to AI agents. Useful for custom edge logic rather than platform management.

**CDN-specific capabilities across the ecosystem:** Cache purging, DNS management, firewall rules, load balancer configuration, R2 storage, KV store operations, Pages deployment, Stream video, Images optimization, and Workers deployment. The Radar server provides global internet traffic insights useful for CDN optimization decisions.

### Fastly

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [fastly/mcp](https://github.com/fastly/mcp) | ~34 | Go | 8 | stdio |

**Fastly's official MCP server stands out for its security architecture.** Launched August 2025, it wraps the Fastly CLI rather than directly calling APIs — meaning **your Fastly API keys never get exposed to the LLM**. This prevents an entire class of prompt injection attacks where a malicious prompt could extract credentials. Authentication happens through the pre-authenticated CLI layer.

8 tools with a CLI-wrapping design:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `fastly_list_commands` | Discover available CLI commands |
| `fastly_describe` | Get detailed help for specific commands |
| `fastly_execute` | Run CLI commands through the MCP interface |
| `fastly_result_read` | Read paginated results |
| `fastly_result_query` | Query within result sets |
| `fastly_result_summary` | Summarize large outputs |
| `fastly_result_list` | List cached result sets |
| `current_time` | Get current timestamp |

**CDN capabilities:** Service creation and management, domain configuration, backend setup, cache purging (URL and surrogate key), TLS certificate management, ACL configuration, version management, and real-time performance analytics including traffic patterns and cache hit ratios.

The smart output pagination system caches large result sets and lets agents query within them — essential when dealing with verbose CDN configuration data. Command allowlisting provides another security layer beyond the CLI wrapping.

Install: pre-built binaries for macOS/Linux/Windows, `go install`, or build from source. Requires Go 1.23+ and Fastly CLI authenticated.

### Akamai

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [ALECS (gamittal-ak)](https://github.com/gamittal-ak/alecs-mcp-server-akamai) | ~0 | TypeScript | 191 | stdio |
| [deepakjd2004/akamai-mcp-server](https://github.com/deepakjd2004/akamai-mcp-server) | ~0 | Python | 4 | stdio |
| schwarztim/akamai-mcp-server | — | — | — | stdio |

**Akamai has no official MCP server**, but the community has stepped up — particularly with ALECS.

**ALECS** (A LaunchGrid for Edge & Cloud Services) is the standout: **191 tools** distributed across 5 specialized servers:

| Server | Tools | Capabilities |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Property Management | 31 | Full CRUD on CDN properties, rule tree management |
| DNS Operations | 24 | Zone management, record CRUD, change-list workflow |
| Certificate Management | 22 | DV enrollment, lifecycle management, validation |
| Security Configuration | 95 | WAF rules, IP/geo blocking, network lists, rate controls |
| Analytics & Metrics | 19 | Traffic reporting, performance metrics |

128 commits, 346+ unit tests with 99%+ pass rate. Supports multi-tenant architecture for MSPs with customer isolation and role-based access. Uses EdgeGrid HMAC-SHA256 authentication. The scale is impressive — 191 tools makes this one of the most comprehensive MCP servers we've seen for any single platform.

**deepakjd2004/akamai-mcp-server** is a minimal Python implementation: 4 capabilities (contracts, groups, property listing, filtering). Single commit, proof-of-concept stage.

**schwarztim/akamai-mcp-server** exists on npm but has minimal documentation and 2 installations. Covers Property Manager, Fast Purge, EdgeWorkers, and DNS management with EdgeGrid authentication.

### Gcore

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [G-Core/gcore-mcp-server](https://github.com/G-Core/gcore-mcp-server) | ~6 | Python | 14 toolsets | stdio |

**Gcore's official MCP server** provides unified access across their entire platform — CDN, GPU Cloud, AI Inference, Video Streaming, WAAP, and cloud resources. Apache-2.0 licensed.

14 predefined toolsets: management, instances, baremetal, gpu_baremetal, gpu_virtual, networking, security, storage, ai, ai_ml, billing, containers, cleanup, list. You select which toolsets to enable via the `GCORE_TOOLS` environment variable, keeping tool counts manageable.

Install via `uv` (Python). 10 commits on main — early stage but officially maintained. The CDN capabilities are part of a broader platform management story rather than CDN-focused.

### Platform Deployment (Vercel, Netlify)

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Focus |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|
| [netlify/netlify-mcp](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-mcp) | ~37 | TypeScript | 15+ | Deployment, project management |
| [DynamicEndpoints/Netlify-MCP-Server](https://github.com/DynamicEndpoints/Netlify-MCP-Server) | — | — | 43 | Full CLI coverage |

Vercel and Netlify MCP servers focus on **deployment platform management** rather than CDN configuration specifically. We've covered [Vercel MCP](/reviews/vercel-mcp-server/) separately. Netlify's official MCP (37 stars) handles project creation, deployment, access control, environment variables, and form management. The community DynamicEndpoints server wraps the full Netlify CLI (43 tools) including blob storage, dev server, recipes, and analytics.

These are worth mentioning because both platforms include built-in CDN/edge capabilities, but the MCP servers don't expose CDN-specific controls (cache headers, edge rules, purging) as discrete tools.

### AWS CloudFront

**No dedicated CloudFront MCP server exists.** The AWS MCP ecosystem (awslabs/mcp, 8,500 stars, 30+ servers) covers EKS, ECS, Lambda, CloudFormation, and more — but CloudFront is conspicuously absent. The AWS Serverless MCP Server can optionally invalidate CloudFront caches when uploading frontend assets to S3, but that's a side feature, not CDN management.

This is a notable gap. CloudFront is one of the most widely-used CDNs, and the lack of MCP tooling means teams using CloudFront can't give AI agents the same CDN management capabilities available for Cloudflare or Fastly.

## What Actually Works

**Cache management** is the most consistently supported operation. Cloudflare, Fastly, and Akamai (via ALECS) all support cache purging — by URL, tag/surrogate key, or full purge. This is the highest-value CDN automation use case: agents can detect stale content issues and trigger targeted purges.

**Configuration management** varies widely. Cloudflare's Code Mode approach (2 tools, 2,500 endpoints) is the most comprehensive. Fastly's CLI wrapping covers full service configuration. ALECS provides 31 property management tools for Akamai. But you're locked into one vendor's MCP server per CDN — there's no cross-CDN abstraction layer.

**Performance analytics** is supported by Cloudflare (Radar, DNS analytics, digital experience monitoring), Fastly (traffic patterns, cache hit ratios), and Akamai (19 analytics tools in ALECS). These are genuinely useful for AI-assisted optimization — an agent can identify low cache hit ratios and suggest configuration changes.

**Edge compute deployment** is primarily a Cloudflare story through Workers MCP. Fastly supports Compute service deployment through its CLI wrapper. Akamai's EdgeWorkers are covered by the schwarztim server but not ALECS.

## What Doesn't Work

**No cross-CDN management.** If you use multiple CDNs (common for enterprise), you need separate MCP servers for each. No one has built a unified CDN MCP interface.

**CloudFront gap.** AWS's most popular CDN has no meaningful MCP tooling. Given AWS's 66-server MCP commitment elsewhere, this seems like an oversight that will eventually be corrected.

**Security trade-offs.** CDN configuration is security-critical — a misconfigured origin, exposed admin endpoint, or wrong cache rule can cause data leaks. Fastly's CLI-wrapping approach is the gold standard here: API keys never reach the LLM. Cloudflare's OAuth flow is solid. ALECS uses EdgeGrid authentication but passes credentials through environment variables that could be accessible to the LLM context. Be thoughtful about what CDN operations you expose to AI agents.

**Smaller CDN providers are invisible.** Bunny CDN, KeyCDN, StackPath, Azure CDN (outside Cloudflare/Fastly/Akamai) — none have MCP servers. If you use these providers, you're writing custom integrations.

## The Bottom Line

The CDN MCP landscape is a **two-tier story**:

**Tier 1 — Production-ready:** Cloudflare (Code Mode or the 16-server suite) and Fastly (official, security-conscious). Both are officially maintained, actively developed, and suitable for production CDN management through AI agents.

**Tier 2 — Impressive but unofficial:** ALECS for Akamai (191 tools, enterprise-grade scope, but 0 stars and community-maintained). Gcore's official server is early-stage. Everything else is experimental.

**Who should use what:**
- **Cloudflare users:** Start with cloudflare/mcp for the Code Mode efficiency. Fall back to mcp-server-cloudflare if you need specific server integrations (Radar, AI Gateway, etc.)
- **Fastly users:** fastly/mcp is the only option and it's good — the CLI security model is a smart design choice
- **Akamai users:** ALECS is remarkably comprehensive for a community project. Evaluate the 191-tool scope against your security requirements
- **AWS CloudFront users:** Wait. Or use the AWS Serverless MCP Server for basic cache invalidation alongside S3 deployments
- **Multi-CDN users:** No good solution yet. You'll need to configure separate MCP servers per provider

**Rating: 3.5/5** — Strong vendor-specific options from Cloudflare and Fastly, but the ecosystem is fragmented with major gaps (CloudFront, smaller CDNs, cross-CDN tooling). The best implementations are genuinely useful; the coverage just isn't universal yet.
