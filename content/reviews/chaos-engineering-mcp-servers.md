Chaos engineering — the practice of deliberately injecting faults to find weaknesses before they become outages — is a natural fit for MCP integration. AI agents that can discover, execute, and analyze chaos experiments through natural language lower the barrier to entry for teams that know they should be testing resilience but find the YAML-heavy workflows intimidating. The category spans three areas: **CNCF platforms** (LitmusChaos, Chaos Mesh), **commercial reliability platforms** (Gremlin, Steadybit, Harness), and **cloud-native fault injection** (AWS FIS).

The headline finding: **LitmusChaos has the strongest official MCP server** with 17 tools covering experiment management, infrastructure monitoring, environment organization, resilience probes, ChaosHub integration, and analytics — the full chaos experiment lifecycle in one server. **Chaos Mesh MCP has the deepest fault injection coverage** with 33 tools across 7 chaos types (network, stress, pod, IO, HTTP, DNS, physical machine), but it's a community project with minimal adoption. Commercial platforms (Gremlin, Steadybit) focus on **read-only observability** — querying experiment results and generating reports rather than directly injecting faults through MCP. The main gap is in **direct fault execution** — most servers either manage experiments or report on results, but few give the AI agent a "break this now" button with proper safety controls.

## CNCF Platforms

### LitmusChaos

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [litmuschaos/litmus-mcp-server](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus-mcp-server) | 12 | Go | 17 | stdio |

**litmuschaos/litmus-mcp-server** (12 stars, Go, 30 commits) is the official MCP server for LitmusChaos 3.x, the CNCF-incubating chaos engineering platform (main repo: 8,700+ stars). Seventeen tools organized into seven categories:

**Experiment management** (4 tools) — `list_chaos_experiments`, `get_chaos_experiment`, `run_chaos_experiment`, `stop_chaos_experiment`. Full lifecycle control: discover available experiments, inspect details, execute on-demand or via cron-like schedules, and stop running experiments with granular control.

**Execution monitoring** (2 tools) — `list_experiment_runs`, `get_experiment_run_details`. Track fault-level success/failure signals, monitor active executions in near real-time, view resiliency score calculations, and retrieve detailed run history with status and duration.

**Infrastructure management** (3 tools) — `list_chaos_infrastructures`, `get_infrastructure_details`, `register_chaos_infrastructure`. Monitor infrastructure heartbeat, last-seen time, and readiness. Generate installation manifests tailored to namespace-scoped or cluster-scoped deployments.

**Environment organization** (2 tools) — `list_environments`, `create_environment`. Create and manage PROD/NON_PROD environments, associate infrastructures with environments, filter experiments by environment context.

**Resilience probes** (2 tools) — `list_resilience_probes`, `create_resilience_probe`. Four built-in probe types: HTTP, Command, Kubernetes, and Prometheus. Plug-and-play architecture for steady-state and post-injection validations.

**ChaosHub integration** (2 tools) — `list_chaos_hubs`, `get_chaos_faults`. Browse chaos faults and documentation, support multiple hubs (Git-backed and remote), categorization and search.

**Analytics** (2 tools) — `get_experiment_statistics`, plus project-wide experiment and infrastructure statistics, resiliency score distributions, and run status breakdowns.

Installation via `go install`, `make build`, or Docker container. Requires Go 1.21+, access to a LitmusChaos 3.x Chaos Center, and valid project credentials with access token. The official documentation at docs.litmuschaos.io includes a dedicated MCP server section. This is the most complete chaos engineering MCP server — it covers the full experiment lifecycle from fault discovery through execution tracking and resilience scoring, all backed by a CNCF project with 8,700+ stars on the main repo.

### Chaos Mesh

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [ernestolee13/chaos-mesh-mcp](https://github.com/ernestolee13/chaos-mesh-mcp) | 1 | Python | 33 | stdio |

**ernestolee13/chaos-mesh-mcp** (1 star, Python, MIT, 10 commits, December 2025) is a community MCP server for Chaos Mesh, the CNCF-incubating chaos engineering platform. Thirty-three tools organized across 7 chaos types plus management:

**NetworkChaos** (4 tools) — delay, packet loss, network partition, corruption. Simulate degraded network conditions between services or pods.

**StressChaos** (3 tools) — CPU stress, memory stress, combined stress. Apply resource pressure to containers to test behavior under load.

**PodChaos** (3 tools) — pod kill, pod failure, container kill. The classic chaos engineering primitives — destroy pods and watch recovery.

**IOChaos** (4 tools) — latency injection, fault injection, attribute override, data corruption. Test how applications handle slow, broken, or corrupted file system operations.

**HTTPChaos** (4 tools) — abort, delay, replace, patch. Manipulate HTTP traffic at the connection and content level — simulate API failures, slow responses, or modified payloads.

**DNSChaos** (2 tools) — error injection, random IP responses. Requires chaos-dns-server pod in the cluster.

**PhysicalMachineChaos** (5 tools) — CPU stress, memory stress, disk fill, process kill, clock skew. Extends beyond Kubernetes to bare-metal or VM targets via the Chaosd agent.

**Management & validation** (8 tools) — environment validation (3 tools), plus experiment status, listing, deletion, pause, resume, and event tracking (5 tools).

Requirements: Kubernetes v1.15+ (tested with v1.27.6), Chaos Mesh v2.6+ (tested with v2.8.0), Python 3.10-3.12, kubectl configured. Install via pip from GitHub. Despite the 1-star count, this is the most comprehensive fault injection MCP server available — 33 tools covering every Chaos Mesh chaos type including the less common PhysicalMachineChaos and DNSChaos. The lack of adoption is the main concern. No official Chaos Mesh MCP server exists yet.

## Commercial Platforms

### Gremlin

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [gremlin/mcp](https://github.com/gremlin/mcp) | 5 | TypeScript | 11 | stdio |

**gremlin/mcp** (5 stars, TypeScript, Apache 2.0, 4 commits) is the official MCP server for Gremlin's Reliability Intelligence platform. Eleven tools focused on **read-only observability and reporting**: `list_services`, `get_service_dependencies`, `get_reliability_report`, `get_pricing_report`, `get_client_summary`, `get_attack_summary`, and testing-related functions. Designed "out of the box to carry out non-destructive operations" — you can safely query reliability data without affecting systems or Gremlin configuration.

Key use cases: identify services that need testing, discover uncovered critical dependencies, detect gaps in test coverage, and generate reliability reports for stakeholders. RBAC scoping via API keys adds access control. Containerized isolation for security.

Requires Node.js 22+, npm, and a Gremlin account with REST API key. Part of Gremlin's broader Reliability Intelligence launch, which combines automated fault injection experiments, continuous resilience analysis, and MCP-based LLM integration. The read-only design is a deliberate safety choice — Gremlin runs actual fault injection experiments, and allowing an AI agent to trigger those without human review would be risky. The 4-commit count suggests this is still early.

### Steadybit

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [steadybit/mcp](https://github.com/steadybit/mcp) | 0 | Java | 11 | stdio |

**steadybit/mcp** (0 stars, Java, MIT, 60 commits, May 2025) is the official MCP server for Steadybit's chaos engineering platform. Eleven tools:

- `list-experiment-designs` / `get_experiment_design` — browse and inspect experiment definitions
- `list_experiment_executions` / `get_experiment_execution` — review execution history and results
- `list_actions` — discover available chaos actions in the platform
- `list_environments` / `list_teams` — organizational context
- `list_experiment_schedules` — view automated experiment schedules
- `list_experiment_templates` / `get_experiment_template` — browse reusable templates
- `create_experiment_from_template` — the only write operation, creating experiments from existing templates

Docker deployment: `docker run -i --rm -e API_TOKEN ghcr.io/steadybit/mcp:latest`. Requires API_TOKEN environment variable and optional API_URL configuration. Steadybit positioned this as "the first MCP server for chaos engineering" when they launched it, though LitmusChaos and others were close behind. The template-based experiment creation is a smart safety pattern — the AI agent can create experiments but only from pre-approved templates, not arbitrary fault configurations. Sixty commits suggests more active development than most in this category.

### Harness

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [harness/mcp-server](https://github.com/harness/mcp-server) | 30 | Go | 6 (chaos) | stdio |

**harness/mcp-server** (30 stars, Go, 262 commits) is Harness's unified MCP server covering 21+ platform toolsets — chaos engineering is one module alongside pipelines, secrets, security, cost management, and more. Six chaos-specific tools:

- `chaos_experiments_list` — discover available experiments in a project
- `chaos_experiment_describe` — retrieve experiment details including purpose, infrastructure targets, and success criteria
- `chaos_experiment_run` — execute experiments with intelligent parameter detection
- `chaos_experiment_run_result` — obtain results with resilience scores and performance impact analysis
- `chaos_probes_list` — discover monitoring probes that validate system health during experiments
- `chaos_probe_describe` — get probe configuration and validation criteria details

Requires Harness Platform access with Chaos Engineering enabled, API key, Organization ID, and Project ID. Go 1.23+ for building from source. The 262-commit count reflects the full platform MCP server, not just chaos. The value proposition is strongest for teams already using Harness — you get chaos engineering MCP alongside 20+ other platform integrations in one server. For chaos-only use cases, LitmusChaos's dedicated server is more comprehensive.

## Cloud-Native Fault Injection

### AWS Fault Injection Service

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [RadiumGu/aws-fis-mcp-server](https://github.com/RadiumGu/aws-fis-mcp-server) | 3 | Python | 10 | stdio |

**RadiumGu/aws-fis-mcp-server** (3 stars, Python, MIT, 13 commits, January 2025) enables interaction with AWS Fault Injection Service for managing chaos experiments on AWS workloads. Ten tools split between read-only and write operations:

**Read-only** (6 tools, always available) — `list_experiment_templates`, `get_experiment_template`, `list_experiments`, `get_experiment`, `list_action_types`, `generate_template_example`.

**Write operations** (4 tools, require `--allow-writes` flag) — `start_experiment`, `stop_experiment`, `create_experiment_template`, `delete_experiment_template`.

Read-only mode by default is the right safety choice for a fault injection service. Region support with configurable defaults. Structured error messaging for blocked operations. Requires Python 3.10+, boto3, and AWS credentials with FIS permissions. Community project — no official AWS MCP server for FIS exists, though the awslabs/mcp monorepo (4,700+ stars) covers many AWS services. This fills the FIS gap for teams running chaos experiments on AWS.

## AI Agent Resilience Testing

While not MCP servers themselves, two related projects are worth noting:

**deepankarm/agent-chaos** (19 stars, Python, Apache 2.0, 57 commits, v0.1.3 January 2026) is a chaos engineering framework for testing AI agent resilience. Instead of breaking infrastructure, it breaks the AI stack itself — injecting LLM failures (rate limits, server errors, timeouts, stream interruptions), tool failures (errors, timeouts, data corruption), and prompt injection attacks. Integrates with DeepEval and Pydantic Evals for semantic evaluation. Randomized chaos combinations via fuzzing. Not an MCP server, but directly relevant to teams building MCP-based agent systems who want to test how their agents handle degraded conditions.

**Alexey Tyurin's MCP Reliability Playbook** (Google Cloud Community, March 2026) documents chaos testing patterns for MCP-based systems — a reference project demonstrating 9 reliability patterns with automated chaos tests that inject faults and verify graceful degradation. The chaos testing framework is generic enough to work with any MCP-based system, with efforts to extract it into a standalone open-source project.

## What's Missing

The chaos engineering MCP landscape has significant gaps:

- **No ChaosBlade MCP server** — Alibaba's CNCF Sandbox project (6,000+ stars) has no MCP integration
- **No Toxiproxy MCP server** — Shopify's TCP proxy for chaos testing (the most widely adopted tool by repository count) has no MCP server
- **No PowerfulSeal MCP server** — though the project appears dormant since 2021
- **No Netflix Chaos Monkey MCP server** — the tool that started it all has no MCP integration
- **No Chaos Toolkit MCP server** — the open API standard for chaos engineering lacks MCP connectivity
- **No Azure Chaos Studio MCP server** — no GCP equivalent either
- **Limited safety controls** — most servers that allow fault injection don't implement approval workflows, blast radius limits, or automatic rollback through MCP
- **No cross-platform abstraction** — each server is tightly coupled to its platform; no unified chaos engineering MCP interface exists
- **No GameDay orchestration** — no MCP server coordinates multi-team chaos experiments or manages the full GameDay workflow

## The Bottom Line

Chaos engineering MCP servers are in their early days but the foundation is solid. **LitmusChaos** is the clear recommendation for teams wanting the most complete MCP integration — 17 tools covering the full experiment lifecycle, backed by a CNCF-incubating project with official documentation. **Chaos Mesh MCP** offers the deepest fault injection coverage (33 tools across 7 chaos types) but needs community adoption. **Gremlin and Steadybit** are the right choices for teams already on those platforms who want AI-powered reporting and analysis. **AWS FIS MCP** fills the gap for AWS-native chaos experiments. The biggest opportunity is in **safety-controlled direct fault injection** — most servers either fully expose fault triggers or keep everything read-only. The sweet spot — AI-guided chaos with human approval gates and automatic blast radius limits — doesn't exist yet.

Rating: **3.5 out of 5** — Good platform coverage from CNCF projects and commercial tools, meaningful tool depth in LitmusChaos and Chaos Mesh, but early adoption across the board, no cross-platform abstraction, and significant gaps (ChaosBlade, Toxiproxy, Chaos Monkey, cloud providers). The category will improve as chaos engineering platforms recognize MCP as a standard integration point.
