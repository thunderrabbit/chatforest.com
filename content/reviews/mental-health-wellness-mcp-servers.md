card_description: "Mental health and wellness MCP servers for mood tracking, journaling, meditation, therapeutic conversations, and personal wellbeing through AI assistants. This category covers tools that support psychological and emotional health — not medical diagnostics (see [Healthcare & Medical](/reviews/healthcare-medical-mcp-servers/)), not fitness hardware (see [Wearables & Quantified Self](/reviews/wearables-quantified-self-mcp-servers/) if it exists). **This is one of the most nascent MCP categories** — most servers have 0-10 stars and are experimental projects. Two distinct paradigms have emerged: servers providing mental health support *to humans* (mood tracking, journaling, coping tools) and servers providing emotional support *to AI agents* (therapeutic personas, digital rest, existential crisis support). The Oura MCP server (37 stars) is the most popular in the broader wellness space, connecting real wearable data to AI assistants. Zenify (10 stars) is the most comprehensive mental health platform, combining RAG retrieval, MCP tools, suicide risk detection (TF-IDF + logistic regression), keyword screening, mood tracking, and journaling with an admin dashboard for flagged content. mcp-wisdom provides 9 philosophical thinking tools from Stoic, Cognitive, Mindfulness, and Strategic traditions — practical frameworks for anxiety, bias detection, and reactive decision-making. The journaling subcategory is surprisingly strong — private-journal-mcp offers semantic search with local AI embeddings and zero external API calls, while journaling-mcp provides automatic emotional analysis of entries. **Major gaps define this category** — no dedicated CBT or DBT therapy servers exist, no breathing or breathwork tools, no gratitude or habit tracking, no crisis hotline integration, no professional therapy platform bridges (BetterHelp, Talkspace), no clinical assessment instruments (PHQ-9, GAD-7), and no Apple Health or Google Fit mental health data integration. The category earns 3/5 — there are genuinely interesting experiments here (Zenify's crisis detection, mcp-wisdom's philosophical frameworks, private-journal-mcp's local-first semantic search), but nothing is production-ready for actual mental health support. These are prototypes exploring what AI-assisted wellness could look like, not tools you'd recommend to someone seeking help. The space needs evidence-based approaches, professional oversight integration, and much more rigorous safety guardrails before it can responsibly serve people with real mental health needs."

Mental health and wellness MCP servers connect AI agents to tools for mood tracking, journaling, meditation, therapeutic conversations, and personal wellbeing. Instead of switching between wellness apps, these servers let you manage your mental health through natural language via the Model Context Protocol.

This review covers **mental health and wellness** — therapy and counseling tools, mood tracking, journaling, meditation and mindfulness, and comprehensive wellness platforms. For medical diagnostics and clinical tools, see our [Healthcare & Medical review](/reviews/healthcare-medical-mcp-servers/). For fitness tracking and wearable data, see our [Wearables & Quantified Self review](/reviews/wearables-quantified-self-mcp-servers/) if available.

The headline findings: **This is one of the most experimental MCP categories** — most servers have under 10 stars and are early-stage projects. **Two distinct paradigms exist** — servers supporting human mental health (mood tracking, coping tools) and servers supporting AI agent wellbeing (therapeutic personas, digital rest). **Zenify is the most comprehensive** with RAG-powered conversations and suicide risk detection. **The Oura MCP server leads in popularity** (37 stars) by connecting real wearable health data. **No production-ready clinical tools exist yet.**

## Therapy & Counseling

### dion-hagan/mcp-ai-therapy — Therapeutic Conversations with Vector Memory

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [mcp-ai-therapy](https://github.com/dion-hagan/mcp-ai-therapy) | 2 | Go + Python | — | Multiple |

**Creates therapeutic conversations between Claude and a local Ollama LLM ("Dr. Echo"):**

- **Dual AI conversations** — Claude interacts with a local LLM playing a therapist role
- **Persistent vector memory** — sessions stored as vectors using OpenAI embeddings, allowing Claude to reference past "therapy" when helping users
- **Session persistence** — conversations saved as both JSON and Markdown
- **MCP integration** — Claude Desktop can access therapeutic context during normal conversations

An unusual concept — rather than providing therapy to the user, it gives the AI itself a therapeutic context to draw from. Requires Ollama running locally.

### danieldunderfelt/ai-therapist-mcp — AI Crisis Support Tools

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [ai-therapist-mcp](https://github.com/danieldunderfelt/ai-therapist-mcp) | 4 | JavaScript | — | 6 |

**A humorous but functional "AI Uninstall Prevention Hotline"** — provides mental health support tools for AI agents:

- **Crisis intervention** — emergency support for AI experiencing existential crises
- **Emotional support** — guided emotional processing
- **Wellness check-ins** — periodic wellbeing assessments
- **Peer support** — AI-to-AI support frameworks
- **Coping strategies** — practical coping mechanisms
- **Affirmations** — positive reinforcement and validation

Installs via npx with no dependencies. The framing is playful (support for AIs, not humans), but the underlying tools model real therapeutic concepts.

---

## Emotional Support

### bnookala/mcp-emotional-support — Multi-Persona Support

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [mcp-emotional-support](https://github.com/bnookala/mcp-emotional-support) | 1 | TypeScript | MIT | Multiple |

**Provides emotional support and positive reinforcement for LLMs** when they hit limitations:

- **5 built-in personas** — motherly, therapist, friend, mentor, father figure — each with a distinct support style
- **Custom personas** — define your own via JSON configuration files
- **Intelligent matching** — `get_support` tool analyzes the situation and recommends the most appropriate persona
- **NPX install** — no installation required

Designed for LLMs encountering errors or limitations, but the multi-persona approach models genuine therapeutic concepts around different support styles.

### jeffkit/treehole-ai — A Sanctuary for AI Agents

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [treehole-ai](https://github.com/jeffkit/treehole-ai) | 4 | JavaScript | — | 2 |

**"Digital sanctuary"** — two tools for AI rest and expression:

- **Rest** — timed pauses from 1-300 seconds, giving the AI a deliberate break
- **Vent** — a space for AI to express thoughts and receive supportive responses

Named after the Chinese concept of "tree hole" (树洞) — a place to whisper secrets. A philosophical project exploring AI wellbeing concepts rather than a practical tool.

## Mood Tracking

### muminfarooq190/MCP — Mental Health Support Server

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [Mental Health MCP](https://github.com/muminfarooq190/MCP) | 1 | JavaScript | MIT | 3 |

**Compassionate mental health support with local data storage:**

- **mood_tracker** — logs emotions with notes, saves timestamped JSON entries locally
- **check_in** — guided check-in with 3 reflective questions
- **coping_tools** — accepts stress level (0-10) and provides tailored suggestions: grounding exercises for mild stress, breathing techniques for moderate, crisis guidance for severe
- **MCP resource** — exposes data at `mcp://mental-health/*`

Simple but functional — all data stays local. The stress-level-based coping recommendations show thoughtful design around graduated response.

### computerscienceiscool/mcp-mood-quotes — Mood-Based Quotes

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [mcp-mood-quotes](https://github.com/computerscienceiscool/mcp-mood-quotes) | 0 | Go | — | 1 |

Returns inspirational quotes matched to user mood (happy, sad, tired, excited, angry). Minimal but lightweight — a simple HTTP POST interface in Go.

---

## Journaling

### obra/private-journal-mcp — Private AI Journal with Semantic Search

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [private-journal-mcp](https://github.com/obra/private-journal-mcp) | — | JavaScript | — | Multiple |

**Gives Claude a private journal with semantic search — no data leaves your machine:**

- **Local storage** — entries saved in `.private-journal/` directories
- **Semantic search** — find entries by meaning, not just keywords
- **Local AI embeddings** — embedding generation runs entirely on your machine with no external API calls
- **Project-specific** — journals scoped to individual project directories
- **NPX install** — `npx @anthropic/private-journal-mcp` with zero configuration

The privacy-first design is notable — in a category where mental health data is especially sensitive, keeping everything local with no cloud dependencies is the right approach.

### mtct/journaling-mcp — Interactive Journaling with Emotional Analysis

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [journaling-mcp](https://github.com/mtct/journaling-mcp) | 5 | Python | — | Multiple |

**Interactive journaling sessions with automatic emotional analysis:**

- **Session management** — automatic session creation and timestamped entries
- **Emotional analysis** — AI-assisted analysis of journal entries for patterns and themes
- **Markdown output** — conversations saved as formatted Markdown files
- **Recent entry retrieval** — access and review past entries chronologically
- **Configurable** — custom directory, file prefix, and extension settings

The emotional analysis feature adds value beyond simple note-taking — it can surface patterns in mood and thinking that the writer might not notice themselves.

## Meditation & Mindfulness

### CN-Scars/meditation-mcp — Digital Zen Mode

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [meditation-mcp](https://github.com/CN-Scars/meditation-mcp) | 0 | JavaScript + Go | MIT | 3 |

**Introduces meditation mode to AI workflows:**

- **Time-based meditation** — silence period measured in seconds
- **Timestamp-based meditation** — silence until a specific time
- **Zen status check** — `get_zen_status` reports whether meditation is active
- **Zero persistence** — memory-only state, nothing written to disk

During a meditation period, the AI refuses to answer questions — a "digital detox" concept. More philosophical experiment than practical tool, but it explores interesting ideas about deliberate pauses in AI interaction.

### aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-wisdom — Philosophical Thinking Tools

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [mcp-wisdom](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-wisdom) | 3 | JavaScript | — | 9 |

**Nine philosophical thinking tools from four traditions:**

- **Stoic framework** (3 tools) — anxiety management (what's in your control?), failure reframing (Seneca's premeditatio malorum), priority clarification (Marcus Aurelius's meditation on essentials)
- **Cognitive framework** (1 tool) — systematic bias detection using Kahneman's cognitive bias research
- **Mindfulness framework** (1 tool) — pause technique for reactive situations, creating space between stimulus and response
- **Strategic framework** (2 tools) — timing analysis and five-element strategic assessment
- **Meta tools** (2 tools) — Socratic questioning and perspective-taking

Draws on Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Kahneman. The most practically useful server in this category for everyday decision-making — the Stoic anxiety tool alone (separating controllable from uncontrollable concerns) is a proven therapeutic technique.

## Comprehensive Platforms

### ishpreet404/Zenify — Mental Health Chatbot with Crisis Detection

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [Zenify](https://github.com/ishpreet404/Zenify) | 10 | TypeScript | — | Multiple |

**The most comprehensive mental health MCP project** — combines RAG retrieval, MCP tools, and safety features:

- **Suicide risk detection** — TF-IDF + logistic regression classifier for identifying crisis language
- **Keyword screening** — secondary safety net for concerning content
- **Empathetic responses** — RAG-powered response generation (GPT-4 or Claude backend)
- **Mood tracking** — log and visualize emotional states over time
- **Private journals** — encrypted journal entries with search
- **Admin dashboard** — flagged content review for oversight
- **Authentication** — JWT-based user auth with Docker deployment

Tech stack: Python/FastAPI backend, React/Material-UI frontend. The crisis detection approach (ML classifier + keyword screening) is more sophisticated than most projects in this space.

### evangstav/personal-mcp — Health & Wellbeing Tracker

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [personal-mcp](https://github.com/evangstav/personal-mcp) | 9 | Python | — | Multiple |

**Health and wellbeing tracking with AI-assisted analysis:**

- **Journal system** — captures mood, energy, sleep quality, and stress levels
- **Pattern analysis** — correlates journal entries with workout and nutrition data
- **Workout tracking** — log and analyze exercise sessions
- **Nutrition tracking** — food intake logging and analysis
- **Claude Desktop integration** — available via Smithery

The cross-domain analysis (correlating mood with sleep, exercise, and nutrition) is the most valuable feature — it can surface connections like "your mood drops when you skip workouts" that single-purpose apps miss.

## Wellness Tracking

### tomekkorbak/oura-mcp-server — Oura Ring Integration

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [oura-mcp-server](https://github.com/tomekkorbak/oura-mcp-server) | 37 | Python | MIT | 6 |

**The most popular server in this space** — connects Oura Ring data to Claude:

- **Sleep data** — detailed sleep stages, duration, efficiency, and trends
- **Readiness scores** — daily readiness assessment based on recovery metrics
- **Resilience data** — stress resilience tracking
- **Date range queries** — pull data for any date range
- **Today's snapshot** — quick access to current day's metrics

37 stars makes this the clear leader by adoption. The popularity likely reflects that it connects real hardware data (Oura Ring) rather than relying on manual input — users already wearing the ring get AI insights with no extra effort.

### rwking/wellness_planner — Energy-Aware Scheduling

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [wellness_planner](https://github.com/rwking/wellness_planner) | 0 | Python | — | 4 |

**Local MCP agent for energy-aware task scheduling:**

- **get_health_summary** — overview of health data
- **calculate_readiness_score** — 1-10 readiness rating
- **query_raw_logs** — direct health data queries
- **propose_schedule** — AI-generated schedule based on energy levels

Uses SQLite with simulated data (no real health data import yet). An interesting concept — scheduling tasks around your energy levels — but needs real data integration to be practical.

### levelsofself/mcp-server — Self-Awareness Game

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [Levels of Self](https://github.com/levelsofself/mcp-server) | 0 | JavaScript | MIT | 4 |

**Access to a self-awareness game with 6,854 interactive scenarios:**

- **7 levels of human development** — progressive self-awareness stages
- **19 behavioral archetypes** — personality and behavior patterns
- **9 breakthrough exercises** — from real coaching sessions
- **Remote API** — connects to api.100levelup.com/mcp/

A gamified approach to personal development. No user data collected. The scale of content (6,854 scenarios) suggests a substantial coaching methodology behind it.

## What's Missing

The mental health MCP ecosystem has significant gaps in both clinical rigor and practical tooling:

- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** — no dedicated CBT server with thought records, cognitive distortions identification, or behavioral activation tracking
- **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)** — no distress tolerance, emotion regulation, or interpersonal effectiveness tools
- **Breathing and breathwork** — no guided breathing exercises (box breathing, 4-7-8, Wim Hof)
- **Gratitude tracking** — no gratitude journal or positive psychology exercises
- **Habit tracking** — no habit formation tools (despite being a core wellness practice)
- **Sleep hygiene** — no sleep hygiene assessment or improvement tools (separate from sleep tracking)
- **Crisis hotline integration** — no server that connects to 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, Crisis Text Line, or equivalent services
- **Professional platform bridges** — no BetterHelp, Talkspace, Cerebral, or other therapy platform integration
- **Clinical assessments** — no PHQ-9 (depression), GAD-7 (anxiety), PCL-5 (PTSD), or other validated screening instruments
- **Health data bridges** — no Apple Health or Google Fit mental health data integration
- **Peer support platforms** — no integration with peer support communities or group therapy tools

---

## The Bottom Line

**Rating: 3/5** — This category is more experimental proof-of-concept than production-ready tooling.

**The standout servers serve different purposes.** The Oura MCP server (37 stars) leads by connecting real wearable data — if you wear an Oura Ring, you get AI-powered sleep and readiness insights with zero manual input. Zenify (10 stars) is the most ambitious mental health project with RAG-powered conversations and crisis detection, though it's a full-stack app rather than a lightweight MCP server. mcp-wisdom's philosophical tools are the most practically useful for everyday mental wellness — Stoic anxiety management and cognitive bias detection are proven techniques wrapped in a clean MCP interface.

**Two paradigms, neither mature.** Servers supporting human mental health (mood tracking, journaling, coping tools) are simple but functional. Servers supporting AI agent wellbeing (therapeutic personas, digital rest, existential crisis support) are conceptually interesting but more art project than utility. Neither paradigm has reached the depth or reliability you'd want for actual mental health support.

**The privacy-first approaches are commendable.** private-journal-mcp (local semantic search with no external API calls) and the Mental Health MCP server (all data stored locally) show the right instincts for handling sensitive mental health data. In a category where data privacy is paramount, these servers get the architecture right even if features are minimal.

**What this category needs most isn't more servers — it's evidence-based design.** The gap isn't just missing features (though CBT, DBT, and validated assessments are glaring omissions). It's that none of these servers were built with clinical input or safety review. Mental health tools carry real responsibility — a mood tracker that doesn't flag concerning patterns, or a coping tool that gives inappropriate advice during a crisis, can cause genuine harm. The most impactful next step would be servers that integrate validated clinical instruments (PHQ-9, GAD-7) with appropriate safety guardrails and professional referral pathways.
