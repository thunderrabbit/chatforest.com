card_description: "Package management and dependency MCP servers for AI-powered version checking, registry search, vulnerability scanning, and dependency management across npm, PyPI, Maven, Cargo, NuGet, and more. **The leading multi-registry checker** — sammcj/mcp-package-version (121 stars, Go, MIT) queries latest stable versions from npm, PyPI, Maven Central, Go Proxy, Swift Packages, Docker Hub, GHCR, and GitHub Actions. Available as standalone binary, Docker container, or Go install with both stdio and SSE transport modes. The maintainer is migrating functionality into a broader mcp-devtools project. **The most comprehensive version tool** — MShekow/package-version-check-mcp (5 stars, Python, Apache-2.0) covers 10+ language registries (npm, PyPI, NuGet, Maven/Gradle, Go, Packagist, RubyGems, Crates.io, pub.dev, Swift) plus DevOps ecosystems (Docker, Helm, GitHub Actions, Terraform providers/modules) and ~1000 development tools via mise-en-place integration. Optional TTL caching, multiple deployment options including hosted service. **12 registries with vulnerability scanning** — Tripletex/mcp-dependency-version (TypeScript/Deno) supports npm, Maven Central, PyPI, Crates.io, Go, JSR, NuGet, Docker Hub, RubyGems, Packagist, pub.dev, and Swift PM. Unique features include OSV database vulnerability scanning, dependency file analysis with update detection, and Docker tag lookups. Emphasizes exact version pinning over ranges for supply chain security. **Registry search with security advisories** — Artmann/package-registry-mcp (35 stars, TypeScript, MIT) searches npm, Cargo/crates.io, NuGet, PyPI, and Go packages with version history tracking and GitHub Security Advisory integration for vulnerability checking. Works with Claude, Cursor, and Copilot. **Batch processing across 7 registries** — niradler/dependency-mcp (TypeScript) checks npm, PyPI, Maven, NuGet, RubyGems, Crates.io, and Go modules. Supports batch processing up to 100 packages simultaneously with 3-5x performance improvement through concurrent processing. Six tools split between single and multi-package operations. **npm gets full lifecycle management** — pinkpixel-dev/npm-helper-mcp (8 stars, TypeScript, MIT) provides dependency update detection, peer dependency conflict resolution, version constraint configuration, iterative testing with automatic reversion, and npm registry search. devlimelabs/npm-manage-mcp (TypeScript, MIT) covers the complete npm lifecycle — init, install, uninstall, update, scripts, version, publish, audit, info, and search across 13+ tools. **Python packages have the deepest tooling** — loonghao/pypi-query-mcp-server (18 stars, Python) offers 25 tools across 7 categories: core info (metadata, versions, dependencies), compatibility checking (Python version assessment), advanced analysis (recursive dependency resolution, local downloads), statistics (download trends, top packages, popularity), environment analysis (outdated packages, update plans), trending analysis (daily trends, new packages), and 8 prompt templates for guided decisions (quality audit, alternative suggestions, migration planning). Supports private PyPI registries and async operations with caching. **Maven/JVM has solid coverage** — Bigsy/maven-mcp-server (31 stars, JavaScript, MIT) retrieves latest stable releases with pre-release filtering, version existence verification, sorted version history, and format support for Maven, Gradle, SBT, and Mill. danielscholl/maven-mcp-server (Python) adds batch processing, semantic versioning comparison, POM dependency auto-detection, and classifier support. **Supply chain security is well-covered** — SocketDev/socket-mcp (89 stars, TypeScript, MIT) provides the depscore tool for querying supply chain risk, quality, maintenance, vulnerability, and license scores across npm, PyPI, Cargo, and more. Publicly hosted at mcp.socket.dev with no API key needed — zero setup required. snyk/agent-scan (1,900 stars, Python, Apache-2.0) goes beyond packages to scan AI agent components themselves, detecting 15+ security risks including prompt injection, tool poisoning, and tool shadowing in MCP servers. Also provides SCA (open source dependency scanning), SAST (code security), and IaC scanning. **Ecosystem-specific servers exist for iOS and PHP** — elchika-inc/cocoapods-package-readme-mcp-server (TypeScript, MIT) fetches CocoaPods package READMEs, metadata, and search results with intelligent caching. A Composer package MCP server provides similar functionality for PHP's Packagist registry. **Gaps remain significant** — no lock file parsing (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, poetry.lock, Cargo.lock analysis), no automated dependency update PRs (no Renovate/Dependabot-style MCP), no license compliance scanning or enforcement, no SBOM generation, no monorepo dependency analysis, no transitive dependency visualization, no private registry authentication for most servers, limited Gradle/SBT-specific tooling beyond Maven Central queries. The category earns 3/5 — package management MCP servers cover the basics well. Version checking across multiple registries is mature, with several competing implementations. Security scanning has strong entries from Socket and Snyk. PyPI tooling is surprisingly deep with 25 tools. But the ecosystem lacks the workflow automation that developers actually need — automated update PRs, lock file analysis, license compliance, and SBOM generation. Most servers are read-only query tools rather than active dependency management assistants. The gap between 'check what version exists' and 'manage my project dependencies end-to-end' is where the next wave of development needs to happen."

Package management and dependency MCP servers let AI assistants check package versions, search registries, scan for vulnerabilities, and manage dependencies across the major package ecosystems. Instead of manually checking npm, PyPI, Maven Central, or crates.io, AI agents can query registries and assess dependency health through the Model Context Protocol.

This review covers the **package management and dependency** ecosystem — multi-registry version checkers, npm-specific tools, PyPI tools, Maven/JVM tools, security scanners, and ecosystem-specific servers. For related servers, see our [DevOps review](/reviews/devops-mcp-servers/) and [Code Quality review](/reviews/code-quality-mcp-servers/).

The headline findings: **sammcj/mcp-package-version (121 stars) leads multi-registry version checking** across npm, PyPI, Maven, Go, Docker, and more. **SocketDev/socket-mcp (89 stars) provides supply chain security scoring** with zero setup. **snyk/agent-scan (1,900 stars) scans AI agents themselves** for security risks. **PyPI has the deepest single-ecosystem tooling** with 25 tools from pypi-query-mcp-server.

Detects **15+ security risks** specific to MCP servers and AI agent skills: prompt injection, tool poisoning, tool shadowing, toxic flows, malware payloads, credential handling issues, and hardcoded secrets. Requires a Snyk API token.

## Ecosystem-Specific Servers

### CocoaPods (iOS/macOS)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [cocoapods-package-readme-mcp-server](https://github.com/elchika-inc/cocoapods-package-readme-mcp-server) | 0 | TypeScript | MIT | 3 |

Intelligent caching minimizes API requests. Optimized for extracting Swift and Objective-C code examples.

### Composer/Packagist (PHP)

A Composer package MCP server provides similar README and metadata retrieval functionality for PHP's Packagist registry, enabling AI agents to explore PHP package documentation and dependencies.

## What's Missing

The package management MCP ecosystem has notable **gaps**:

- **No lock file parsing** — no servers analyze package-lock.json, yarn.lock, poetry.lock, Cargo.lock, or similar lock files
- **No automated update PRs** — nothing like Renovate or Dependabot that creates pull requests for dependency updates via MCP
- **No license compliance scanning** — no servers check or enforce license compatibility across dependency trees
- **No SBOM generation** — no Software Bill of Materials creation from project dependencies
- **No monorepo dependency analysis** — no tools for managing dependencies across monorepo workspaces
- **No transitive dependency visualization** — no dependency tree or graph generation
- **Limited private registry support** — pypi-query-mcp-server is the notable exception; most servers only query public registries
- **Limited Gradle/SBT tooling** — Maven Central is well-served but build-tool-specific features are thin

## The Bottom Line

Package management MCP servers earn **3 out of 5**. The fundamentals are solid — version checking across multiple registries is mature, with several competing implementations covering npm, PyPI, Maven, Cargo, NuGet, RubyGems, Go, and more. Security scanning has strong entries from Socket (zero-setup supply chain scoring) and Snyk (1,900 stars, comprehensive agent security). PyPI tooling is surprisingly deep with 25 tools.

But the ecosystem is mostly **read-only query tools**. The gap between "check what version exists" and "manage my project dependencies end-to-end" is significant. Developers need lock file analysis, automated update workflows, license compliance, and SBOM generation — none of which exist yet in MCP form. Most servers answer "what's the latest version?" but can't answer "should I upgrade, and what will break?"

The next wave of development needs to bridge that gap — turning passive version checkers into active dependency management assistants that can analyze, recommend, and safely apply updates.
