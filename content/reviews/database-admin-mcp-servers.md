Database administration is one of the oldest and most critical software tasks — and one of the most natural fits for AI assistance. Database administration MCP servers let AI agents inspect schemas, execute queries, analyze performance, tune indexes, manage migrations, and monitor health across production and development environments.

The headline finding: **database MCP servers are the most mature category we've reviewed**. PostgreSQL alone has 5+ serious options including Postgres MCP Pro (2,300 stars) with industrial-strength index tuning. MongoDB's official server ships 40+ tools with Atlas management and automatic embedding generation. Multi-database servers like FreePeak's DB MCP Server connect to MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Oracle simultaneously. The challenge isn't finding a server — it's choosing the right one from a crowded field.

## The Landscape

### PostgreSQL

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [crystaldba/postgres-mcp](https://github.com/crystaldba/postgres-mcp) | ~2,300 | Python | 8 | stdio, SSE |
| [@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers-archived/tree/main/src/postgres) | ~231 | TypeScript | 1 | stdio |

**Postgres MCP Pro** (2,300 stars, MIT) is the clear winner for self-hosted PostgreSQL. 8 tools covering schema inspection, SQL execution, query explanation, workload analysis, and — most notably — **intelligent index tuning** that employs industrial-strength algorithms to identify optimal indexes from thousands of possibilities. The `analyze_db_health` tool evaluates index health, connection utilization, buffer cache performance, vacuum status, and replication lag in a single call. Supports both unrestricted development mode and restricted production-safe read-only mode. 79 commits, actively maintained.

The **official PostgreSQL MCP server** (231 stars) is archived and has a known **SQL injection vulnerability** — multi-statement injection bypasses its read-only transaction wrapper. **Do not use it in any environment where data matters.**

For cloud PostgreSQL, see our existing reviews of [Neon MCP](/reviews/neon-mcp-server/) (4/5) and [Supabase MCP](/reviews/supabase-mcp-server/) (4/5).

### MySQL

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [benborla/mcp-server-mysql](https://github.com/benborla/mcp-server-mysql) | ~1,300 | TypeScript | 1+ | stdio, HTTP |
| [designcomputer/mysql_mcp_server](https://github.com/designcomputer/mysql_mcp_server) | ~1,200 | Python | 4 | stdio |
| [neverinfamous/mysql-mcp](https://github.com/neverinfamous/mysql-mcp) | ~3 | TypeScript | 192 | stdio, HTTP/SSE |

**benborla/mcp-server-mysql** (1,300 stars, MIT) is the most popular MySQL MCP server. Originally read-only, it now supports DDL operations and write queries via configuration flags. Key features: SSH tunnel support for remote databases, multi-database configuration mode, schema-specific permission controls, query caching, connection pooling, prepared statement support for SQL injection prevention, rate limiting, and query complexity analysis. Remote HTTP mode with bearer token authentication. Integrates with Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex CLI.

**designcomputer/mysql_mcp_server** (1,200 stars, MIT, Python) takes a simpler approach — 4 core capabilities (list tables, read contents, execute queries, manage access) with environment variable-based credential management and comprehensive operation logging. v0.2.2, last updated April 2025. Good for straightforward MySQL access without the complexity of advanced features.

**neverinfamous/mysql-mcp** (3 stars, MIT) is the most ambitious: 192 specialized tools across 25 tool groups, Code Mode execution with worker-thread isolation (claiming 70-90% token savings), OAuth 2.1 authentication, support for ProxySQL/MySQL Router/MySQL Shell, spatial/GIS operations, full-text search, replication management, and document store collections. 2,169 tests at 90% coverage. Updated February 2026. The tool count is impressive but the 3-star count suggests minimal community adoption — evaluate carefully before committing to a 192-tool server.

### MongoDB

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [mongodb-js/mongodb-mcp-server](https://github.com/mongodb-js/mongodb-mcp-server) | ~959 | TypeScript | 40+ | stdio, HTTP, Docker |

**MongoDB's official MCP server** (959 stars) is the most feature-rich database MCP server across any platform. 40+ tools organized into three categories:

- **Database tools (23):** Queries, aggregations, indexing (including vector search indexes), schema inspection, document CRUD, collection management
- **Atlas tools (12):** Cluster management, monitoring, network access rules, database user management, project administration
- **Assistant tools (2):** Knowledge base search integration

Recent additions (Winter 2026): **Performance Advisor integration** (get index recommendations without leaving your IDE), **automatic embedding generation** for fields with vector search indexes (using Voyage AI models), and **local MongoDB management** (create, inspect, delete local clusters). Granular safety controls include read-only mode and tool disabling. Requires Node.js 20.19.0+.

We previously reviewed MongoDB MCP in depth — see our [MongoDB MCP review](/reviews/mongodb-mcp-server/) (4/5).

### Redis

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [redis/mcp-redis](https://github.com/redis/mcp-redis) | ~452 | Python | 8+ categories | stdio, Docker |

**Redis's official MCP server** (452 stars, MIT) covers all major Redis data structures: strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, streams, JSON documents, and pub/sub. Beyond basic operations, it includes vector search and indexing capabilities, documentation search, and server management/health check tools. EntraID/Azure Active Directory authentication for managed Redis. Multiple connection modes: standard, SSL/TLS, and cluster mode. Redis ACL integration for access control.

Redis also ships **mcp-redis-cloud** as a companion for Redis Cloud management — separate from the data-plane server above.

### DynamoDB

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [awslabs/mcp (DynamoDB)](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/tree/main/src/dynamodb-mcp-server) | — | TypeScript | 8 | stdio |

**AWS's official DynamoDB MCP server** is part of the awslabs/mcp monorepo (Apache-2.0). 8 tools focused on the full data modeling lifecycle rather than just CRUD operations:

- **Data modeling guidance** — requirements gathering, access pattern analysis, schema design
- **Model validation** — automatically tests models against DynamoDB Local by creating tables, inserting sample data, and executing all defined access patterns
- **Source database analysis** — extracts schema and access patterns from existing MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server databases to inform DynamoDB design
- **Schema conversion** — transforms human-readable models into machine-readable JSON with automatic validation
- **Code generation** — type-safe Python code with Pydantic entity classes, repository patterns, and CRUD operations
- **Cost analysis** — calculates RCU/WCU and monthly costs based on access patterns
- **CDK deployment** — generates AWS CDK applications for infrastructure-as-code table deployment

This is a **design-and-migrate tool**, not a runtime query tool. It's most valuable when you're migrating to DynamoDB or designing new tables, not for day-to-day administration.

### Supabase

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [supabase-community/supabase-mcp](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-mcp) | ~2,500 | TypeScript | 30+ | stdio |

**Supabase's MCP server** (2,500 stars, Apache-2.0) goes well beyond database administration — 30+ tools across 8 feature groups: account management, documentation search, database operations (schema inspection, SQL execution, migrations), debugging/logging, development branching, edge functions deployment, storage configuration, and TypeScript type generation from database schemas. Read-only query mode and project-scoped access restriction for safety. 360 commits with active development. Works with Cursor, Claude, and Windsurf.

We previously reviewed Supabase MCP in depth — see our [Supabase MCP review](/reviews/supabase-mcp-server/) (4/5).

### Multi-Database Servers

| Server | Stars | Language | Databases | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| [FreePeak/db-mcp-server](https://github.com/FreePeak/db-mcp-server) | ~353 | Go | MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, TimescaleDB | 5 per connection | stdio, SSE, Docker |
| [executeautomation/mcp-database-server](https://github.com/executeautomation/mcp-database-server) | ~320 | TypeScript | SQLite, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL | 10 | stdio |

**FreePeak/db-mcp-server** (353 stars, MIT, Go) is the most architecturally serious multi-database server. Connects to multiple databases simultaneously with database-specific tool generation for each instance. Lazy loading mode defers connection establishment until first use — essential for setups with 10+ databases. Clean Architecture design. Support for encrypted SQLite (SQLCipher), in-memory databases, and Oracle RAC/Cloud Wallet/TNS configuration. 161 commits.

**executeautomation/mcp-database-server** (320 stars, MIT, TypeScript) takes a simpler approach with 10 tools: read_query, write_query, create_table, alter_table, drop_table, list_tables, describe_table, export_query (CSV/JSON), append_insight, and list_insights. AWS IAM authentication for RDS MySQL instances. Business insight tracking. 35 commits.

## What's Good

**Mature, production-tested options.** Unlike many MCP categories where you're choosing between one official server and a handful of experiments, database MCP has multiple battle-tested options per platform. Postgres MCP Pro has 2,300 stars. MongoDB's official server is at 40+ tools with Winter 2026 updates. Supabase has 2,500 stars and 360 commits. These are not weekend projects.

**Safety controls are common.** Read-only modes are available on nearly every server — Postgres MCP Pro, MongoDB, Supabase, Redis, and MySQL all support restricting write access. This is critical because database MCP servers have direct access to your data. The category has learned from the official PostgreSQL server's SQL injection vulnerability.

**Performance tooling beyond CRUD.** Postgres MCP Pro's index tuning algorithms, MongoDB's Performance Advisor integration, and DynamoDB's cost analysis tools go beyond basic "run a query" operations. These are genuinely useful for database administration, not just data access.

**Multi-database support exists.** If you work with heterogeneous database environments, FreePeak's DB MCP Server and executeautomation's server let you connect to multiple databases from a single MCP server, reducing configuration complexity.

## What's Missing

**No unified admin panel.** Tools like pgAdmin, DBeaver, Adminer, and phpMyAdmin have no MCP presence. These GUI admin tools serve millions of developers, but none have adopted MCP. The pattern of "direct database connection via MCP" rather than "admin tool integration via MCP" means you lose the higher-level abstractions these tools provide (visual schema editors, visual query builders, monitoring dashboards).

**Migration tooling is thin.** Database migrations are a core administration task, but only Supabase handles them well (automatic migration versioning). For other platforms, you'd need to pair your database MCP server with a separate migration tool. No MCP server wraps Flyway, Liquibase, or Alembic.

**Cross-database query federation.** No MCP server can query across multiple database types in a single operation. FreePeak's server connects to multiple databases, but each query targets a single database. For analytics across heterogeneous data sources, you still need a data warehouse or federation layer.

**Managed database services.** AWS RDS (non-DynamoDB), Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database — the major managed database platforms lack dedicated MCP servers for administration tasks (monitoring, scaling, backup management, parameter group tuning). DynamoDB and MongoDB Atlas are exceptions with strong MCP support.

## The Bottom Line

Database MCP servers are the **most mature and production-ready category** in the MCP ecosystem:

**Tier 1 — Use with confidence:**
- **Postgres MCP Pro** (crystaldba) for self-hosted PostgreSQL — index tuning and health checks set it apart
- **MongoDB MCP** (official) for MongoDB — 40+ tools, Atlas management, performance advisors, actively maintained
- **Supabase MCP** for Supabase/PostgreSQL — 30+ tools covering the full platform, not just the database
- **Neon MCP** for cloud PostgreSQL — branch-based migrations make schema changes safe

**Tier 2 — Solid choices:**
- **benborla/mcp-server-mysql** for MySQL — 1,300 stars, SSH tunnel support, production features
- **Redis MCP** (official) for Redis — covers all data structures with proper authentication
- **FreePeak/db-mcp-server** for multi-database environments — Go, concurrent connections, lazy loading
- **AWS DynamoDB MCP** for DynamoDB data modeling and migration

**Tier 3 — Approach with caution:**
- **Official PostgreSQL server** — archived, SQL injection vulnerability. **Do not use.**
- **Official SQLite server** — archived, no safety guardrails. Use jparkerweb/mcp-sqlite instead.

**Who should use what:**
- **PostgreSQL (self-hosted):** Postgres MCP Pro. No contest.
- **PostgreSQL (cloud):** Neon MCP for pure database work, Supabase MCP if you use the Supabase platform
- **MySQL:** benborla/mcp-server-mysql for most users. designcomputer's server if you want Python simplicity
- **MongoDB:** The official server. It's comprehensive and actively maintained
- **Redis:** The official redis/mcp-redis. Also official and well-maintained
- **DynamoDB:** AWS's official server for modeling/migration. For runtime queries, use the AWS MCP server's DynamoDB tools
- **Multiple databases:** FreePeak/db-mcp-server for concurrent multi-database access

**Rating: 4.0/5** — The strongest category in the MCP ecosystem. Multiple production-ready options per platform, good safety controls, genuine performance tooling beyond basic CRUD. Points deducted for: no admin tool integrations (pgAdmin, DBeaver), thin migration tooling, and the fact that the official reference servers are the worst options in the category. The community and vendors have built something better than what Anthropic started with.
