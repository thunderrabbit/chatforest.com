All hosted as remote MCP servers at *.mcp.cloudflare.com. **Token-efficient Cloudflare API access** — cloudflare/mcp (263 stars, TypeScript, Apache-2.0) covers 2,500+ Cloudflare API endpoints through just two tools (search and execute), reducing token consumption from ~2 million (raw OpenAPI spec) to 1,069 tokens via a Code Mode pattern where agents write JavaScript executed server-side. Supports Workers, KV, R2, D1, Pages, DNS, Firewall, Load Balancers, Stream, Images, AI Gateway, Vectorize, Access. OAuth and API token authentication. Single URL: mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp. **Worker-to-MCP bridge** — cloudflare/workers-mcp (627 stars, TypeScript, Apache-2.0) converts TypeScript Worker methods into MCP tools via a build step. Local Node.js proxy handles stdio transport. Access any function, API, or Cloudflare service from Claude Desktop, Cursor, or other MCP clients. **Azure Functions MCP extension** — Azure/azure-functions-mcp-extension (32 stars, C#, MIT) is Microsoft's official extension enabling Azure Functions to act as scalable remote MCP servers. Includes MCP tool trigger for defining tools usable by AI agents. Supports .NET isolated worker model with dedicated integration. Configurable via host.json. Samples available in C#, Python, TypeScript, and Java. Self-hosted option lets developers deploy existing MCP SDK-based servers without code changes. **Deploy to Google Cloud Run** — GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-run-mcp (559 stars, JavaScript, Apache-2.0) enables AI agents to deploy applications to Cloud Run. Tools for deployment (direct file upload or local folder), service management (list/describe services), and logging (access logs and errors). Works with Gemini CLI, Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code. Supports IAM authentication and OAuth. Can itself run on Cloud Run for remote access. **Google Cloud CLI via MCP** — googleapis/gcloud-mcp (706 stars, TypeScript, Apache-2.0) provides 40+ tools across four MCP servers: gcloud (CLI interaction), observability (logs/metrics/traces), storage (bucket/object management), and backupdr (backup and disaster recovery). Supports natural language cloud management, permission controls, and service account impersonation. Currently in preview — may have breaking changes. **Vercel MCP adapter** — vercel/mcp-handler (573 stars, TypeScript, Apache-2.0) is an adapter for building MCP servers on Next.js 13+ and Nuxt 3+. Supports Streamable HTTP and SSE transports with optional Redis for SSE resumability. Full TypeScript support with Zod schema validation. Compatible with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and Windsurf. Requires @modelcontextprotocol/sdk 1.25.2+ for security fixes. **Vercel deployment management** — Quegenx/vercel-mcp-server (60 stars, TypeScript) lets AI assistants manage Vercel infrastructure: team/project management, deployment creation/monitoring, domain/DNS configuration, environment variables, Edge Config, access control, log drains, webhooks, and artifact management. Works with Cursor and Codeium. **Firebase services via MCP** — gannonh/firebase-mcp (241 stars, TypeScript, MIT) connects AI assistants to Firestore (CRUD, composite queries, collection groups), Cloud Storage (upload from content/URLs, metadata), and Firebase Auth (user management). HTTP transport for multi-client connections. Emulator support for testing. 201 commits. **Lightweight serverless MCP framework** — fiberplane/mcp-lite (99 stars, TypeScript) is a zero-dependency MCP framework built on the Fetch API. Type-safe tool definitions via Standard Schema validators (Zod, Valibot, Effect, ArkType). Adapter pattern for sessions and client requests. Runs on Node, Bun, Cloudflare Workers, Deno, and Supabase Edge Functions. DNS rebinding protection built in. **Serverless Framework template** — eleva/serverless-mcp-server (18 stars, JavaScript, MIT) provides a minimal MCP server deployed on AWS Lambda via API Gateway using the Serverless Framework. Local development via serverless-offline. One-command AWS deployment. Built on middy-mcp middleware. **Cloudflare MCP template** — mahmoudfazeli/cloudflare-mcp-template (2 stars, TypeScript, MIT) is a reusable template for building serverless MCP servers with provider plugin architecture. OAuth 2.1 support with Dynamic Client Registration, deployable to Cloudflare Workers or Vercel, Claude.ai compatible. **Gaps remain in several areas** — no unified multi-cloud serverless management tool that spans AWS/Azure/GCP/Cloudflare from a single MCP interface. No serverless cost optimization or billing analysis tools. No cold start analysis or performance benchmarking servers. No OpenFaaS, Knative, or other open-source FaaS platform MCP servers. No serverless CI/CD pipeline integration (no direct triggers for GitHub Actions or GitLab CI on function deploy). Limited function versioning, alias management, and canary deployment tools. No serverless application composition tools (Step Functions/Durable Functions management is minimal). No edge function performance monitoring across providers. The category earns 4/5 — serverless MCP servers represent a rapidly maturing category where the major cloud providers are investing heavily. AWS leads with the most comprehensive ecosystem (official monorepo with 14+ servers, Lambda bridge tools, middleware options). Cloudflare stands out with 16 specialized remote MCP servers and the most token-efficient API access pattern. Google and Microsoft have official support but with smaller communities. Vercel provides the best developer experience for Next.js/Nuxt teams. The main gaps are in cross-cloud management, cost optimization, and open-source FaaS platform support."

Serverless and FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) MCP servers let AI assistants deploy, invoke, and manage serverless functions across major cloud platforms through the Model Context Protocol. Instead of navigating cloud consoles or memorizing CLI commands, AI agents can manage serverless infrastructure conversationally.

This review covers the **serverless and FaaS** ecosystem — AWS Lambda tools, Cloudflare Workers integration, Azure Functions support, Google Cloud Run deployment, Vercel adapters, Firebase services, and serverless MCP frameworks. For related servers, see our [Cloud Platform review](/reviews/cloud-platform-mcp-servers/) and [Container/Docker/Kubernetes review](/reviews/container-docker-kubernetes-mcp-servers/).

The headline findings: **AWS has the most comprehensive serverless MCP ecosystem** with 14+ official servers in its monorepo (8,500 stars). **Cloudflare leads in remote MCP hosting** with 16 specialized servers and a uniquely token-efficient API pattern covering 2,500+ endpoints through just two tools. **Every major cloud provider now has official MCP support** for their serverless platform. Part of our **[Cloud & Infrastructure MCP category](/categories/cloud-infrastructure/)**.

## What's Missing

Despite strong coverage from major cloud providers, several gaps remain:

- **No unified multi-cloud serverless management** — no single MCP server spans AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Cloud Functions, and Cloudflare Workers
- **No serverless cost optimization** — no billing analysis, right-sizing recommendations, or cost anomaly detection for serverless workloads
- **No cold start analysis** — no performance benchmarking or cold start monitoring tools
- **No open-source FaaS support** — no OpenFaaS, Knative, or Fission MCP servers
- **No serverless CI/CD integration** — no direct pipeline triggers on function deploy
- **Limited function versioning** — alias management and canary deployments are underserved
- **No serverless composition** — Step Functions and Durable Functions management is minimal
- **No edge function monitoring** — cross-provider performance comparison is absent

## Bottom Line

**Rating: 4/5** — Serverless MCP servers represent a rapidly maturing category where every major cloud provider is investing heavily. AWS leads with the most comprehensive ecosystem — a 14+ server monorepo, Lambda bridge tools, and middleware options. Cloudflare stands out with 16 specialized remote MCP servers and the most token-efficient API access pattern in the entire MCP ecosystem (2,500+ endpoints through two tools). Google and Microsoft have official support but with smaller communities so far. Vercel provides the best developer experience for Next.js/Nuxt teams. The main gaps are in cross-cloud management, cost optimization, and open-source FaaS platform support — areas that will likely see development as enterprise serverless adoption continues to grow.
