card_description: "Sports and fitness analytics MCP servers for live scores, Formula 1 telemetry, betting odds, Strava integration, Garmin health data, and workout tracking through AI assistants. This is one of the more vibrant MCP categories — the combination of publicly available sports APIs and the fitness tracking ecosystem has produced a surprisingly rich set of servers. **Formula 1 stands out with 6+ independent implementations**, more than almost any other single sport, likely driven by the excellent FastF1 Python library and the OpenF1 API. **Strava dominates the endurance space** with r-huijts/strava-mcp leading at 238 stars and 24 tools covering activities, segments, and route exports. **The Garmin Connect MCP server is remarkably comprehensive** with 61 tools spanning health, fitness, and activity data — one of the highest tool counts in any sports server. **Fitness platform aggregation is emerging** — the Pierre server connects to 150+ wearables through Terra, while domestique unifies Intervals.icu, Whoop, and TrainerRoad into a single MCP interface with power curve analysis and recovery tracking. **Sports betting has strong representation** with BetTrack offering 30+ tools across 70+ markets including player props. The multi-sport data servers (ESPN-based mcp-sports, SportDB.dev, Cloudbet) provide broad coverage across major leagues. **The biggest gap is individual sports** — tennis, golf, cricket, rugby, and swimming have essentially zero dedicated MCP servers despite massive global followings. Fantasy sports management (ESPN/Yahoo leagues) is also entirely absent, which is surprising given the popularity of fantasy leagues. Chess has multiple implementations but other board games and esports are thin. The category earns 4/5 — strong coverage of team sports scores, excellent F1 depth, robust fitness tracking ecosystem, and emerging betting tools, with individual sports and fantasy being the main gaps."

Sports and fitness analytics MCP servers connect AI agents to live scores, race telemetry, betting odds, workout data, and fitness tracking platforms. Instead of manually checking scores, switching between fitness apps, or browsing betting lines, these servers let you query sports data through natural language via the Model Context Protocol.

This review covers **sports data, fitness analytics, and workout management** — live scores, F1 racing, sports betting, Strava/Garmin integration, and exercise tracking. For mental health and wellness tracking, see our [Mental Health & Wellness review](/reviews/mental-health-wellness-mcp-servers/). For wearable device data beyond fitness, see our [Wearables & Quantified Self review](/reviews/wearables-quantified-self-mcp-servers/) if available.

The headline findings: **Formula 1 has the deepest coverage of any single sport** with 6+ independent MCP server implementations. **Strava leads the fitness space** with 238 stars and 24 tools in the top server. **Garmin Connect MCP offers 61 tools** spanning health, fitness, and activity data. **Multi-sport platforms cover all major US leagues** plus Premier League and NCAA. **Sports betting is well-represented** with 70+ markets in BetTrack. **Individual sports (tennis, golf, cricket) are almost entirely absent.**

## What's Missing

Despite strong coverage in team sports and fitness tracking, several significant gaps remain:

- **Tennis** — no ATP/WTA rankings, match data, or draw bracket servers
- **Golf** — no PGA Tour stats, scoring, or course information servers
- **Cricket** — no ICC, IPL, or county cricket data servers despite massive global following
- **Rugby** — no World Rugby, Six Nations, or Super Rugby servers
- **Olympic sports** — no swimming, track & field, or Olympic data servers
- **Fantasy sports management** — no ESPN/Yahoo fantasy league management (only read-only ESPN Fantasy Football)
- **Sports video analysis** — no computer vision or play-by-play video analysis
- **Youth sports** — no youth league management, travel team scheduling
- **Marathon/race registration** — no integration with RunSignUp, Athlinks, or similar platforms
- **E-sports** — minimal coverage beyond Cloudbet odds (no dedicated League of Legends, Valorant, or CS2 data servers)
- **Sports news/journalism** — no sports news aggregation beyond ESPN scraping

---

## Bottom Line

The sports and fitness analytics MCP category earns **4 out of 5**. This is a notably strong category driven by three factors: excellent public sports APIs (ESPN, FastF1, OpenF1, Strava), the fitness wearable ecosystem's API-friendly culture, and genuine developer enthusiasm (see: 6+ independent F1 implementations). The Strava MCP server at 238 stars is one of the most popular in any sports domain. The Garmin Connect server with 61 tools provides extraordinary depth. The fitness aggregation servers (Pierre, domestique) show sophisticated multi-platform integration that's ahead of most other MCP categories. Team sports live data is well-covered for major leagues. The main weaknesses are the complete absence of individual sports like tennis, golf, and cricket — surprising given their global popularity — and the lack of fantasy sports management tools. For sports fans and fitness enthusiasts, this is one of the more useful MCP categories available today.
