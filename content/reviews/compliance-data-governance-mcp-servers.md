card_description: "Compliance and data governance MCP servers for security compliance monitoring, GRC workflows, privacy regulation enforcement, data catalog access, metadata management, and data quality validation. This is one of the strongest enterprise categories — major compliance platforms have official MCP servers, and leading data catalog vendors are well represented. **VantaInc/vanta-mcp-server is the compliance leader** — 41 stars, TypeScript, provides AI assistants access to 1,200+ automated security tests across SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR, and more. Filter by status, cloud provider, or framework. Tools are auto-discovered and registered. **secureframe/secureframe-mcp-server offers deep compliance querying** — 11 read-only endpoints covering controls, tests, devices, users, vendors, frameworks, integrations, and repository mappings. Lucene query syntax for precision filtering. Public beta, self-hosted. **Drata MCP brings AI-native trust management** — summarize failed compliance tests instantly, generate real-time risk and controls reports, power AI workflows with live compliance context. Supports SOC 2, HIPAA, ISO 27001. **CISO Assistant is the open-source GRC powerhouse** — 100+ global frameworks with automatic control mapping including ISO 27001, NIST CSF, SOC 2, CIS, PCI DSS, NIS2, DORA, GDPR, HIPAA, CMMC. Risk management, AppSec, audit, TPRM, and privacy in one platform with MCP support. **DPO2U tackles GDPR/LGPD compliance head-on** — self-hosted MCP server with homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs for risk assessments, data flow mapping, breach simulations, and consent verification on encrypted data. Claims 95%+ compliance scores while maintaining complete data privacy. **acryldata/mcp-server-datahub is the data governance standard** — 62 stars, official DataHub MCP server enabling search with boolean logic and usage-based sorting, upstream/downstream lineage with hop control, batch metadata retrieval, SQL query analysis, plus metadata modification tools for tags, ownership, and descriptions. **OpenMetadata MCP is enterprise-grade** — first enterprise MCP server for metadata with data quality tooling (test definitions, test case creation, root cause analysis), semantic search via vector embeddings, and support for Bedrock and OpenAI embeddings. **Atlan MCP brings the active metadata platform** — asset search via natural language, column-level lineage exploration, metadata updates and annotations, business glossary management, data quality rule execution, and DSL-based advanced queries via the pyatlan SDK. **Databricks MCP enables Unity Catalog access** — RafaelCartenet's server lets AI agents explore catalogs, schemas, and tables, understand relationships, discover notebooks and jobs, and execute SQL queries against Databricks. **gx-mcp-server exposes Great Expectations** — davidf9999's server bridges data quality validation and AI agents, loading datasets from CSV, Snowflake, or BigQuery, defining expectations on the fly, running validation suites, and retrieving detailed results. **Gaps remain in emerging areas** — no dedicated NIST RMF implementation server, no EU AI Act compliance tools, no automated data classification MCPs, no consent management platform integrations (OneTrust, TrustArc), no data retention policy enforcement, and no cross-framework compliance gap analysis tools. The category earns 4/5 — major compliance platforms have invested in official MCP servers, data catalog coverage is strong with multiple enterprise-grade options, and the combination gives organizations genuine AI-powered compliance and governance workflows."

Compliance and data governance MCP servers are bringing regulatory intelligence and metadata management directly into AI workflows — monitoring security compliance across frameworks like SOC 2 and HIPAA, managing GRC workflows, enforcing privacy regulations, discovering data assets across catalogs, and running data quality checks, all through the Model Context Protocol. Instead of toggling between compliance dashboards, data catalogs, and quality monitoring tools, these servers let AI assistants handle governance-related queries and analysis natively.

This review covers **compliance and data governance MCP servers** — compliance automation platforms, GRC tools, privacy/GDPR enforcement, data catalogs and metadata management, and data quality validation. For security scanning and vulnerability management, see our [Security MCP review](/reviews/security-mcp-servers/) if available.

## What's Missing

The compliance and data governance MCP ecosystem has strong coverage from major vendors but notable gaps remain:

- **No dedicated NIST RMF server** — the Risk Management Framework is widely used but lacks a standalone MCP implementation
- **No EU AI Act compliance tools** — as the AI Act enters enforcement, no MCP servers address AI-specific governance requirements
- **No automated data classification** — no MCP servers for discovering and classifying sensitive data (PII, PHI, PCI)
- **No consent management platforms** — OneTrust, TrustArc, and Cookiebot lack MCP integrations
- **No data retention policy enforcement** — automated retention and deletion workflows are absent
- **No cross-framework gap analysis** — tools for identifying overlapping and divergent requirements across frameworks
- **No supply chain risk management** — TPRM through MCP for vendor questionnaires and risk scoring

---

## The Bottom Line

The compliance and data governance category earns **4 out of 5** — this is one of the strongest enterprise MCP categories. All three major compliance automation platforms (Vanta, Secureframe, Drata) have official MCP servers, and the data catalog space is well-represented with DataHub, OpenMetadata, Atlan, and Databricks all providing MCP access. CISO Assistant's open-source GRC platform covers 100+ frameworks, and DPO2U tackles the privacy compliance niche with a privacy-first architecture.

The main limitations are in emerging regulatory areas (EU AI Act, AI governance), consent management, and automated data classification. But for organizations looking to bring compliance monitoring and data governance into AI workflows today, the tooling is genuinely production-ready and backed by the companies that matter in this space. The fact that major vendors are investing in official MCP servers — not just community wrappers — signals that this category will only get stronger.
