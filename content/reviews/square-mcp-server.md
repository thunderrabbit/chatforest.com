**At a glance:** [GitHub](https://github.com/square/square-mcp-server) — 95 stars, 21 forks, TypeScript. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/square-mcp-server) — square-mcp-server v0.1.2. Official first-party from [Square](https://squareup.com/) ([Block, Inc.](https://block.xyz/)). Apache 2.0 license. 3 MCP tools wrapping 40+ API services, hosted remote + local server options.

The Square MCP Server is the **official first-party MCP integration** for [Square's](https://squareup.com/) commerce and payments platform. Rather than exposing individual API endpoints as separate tools, it provides a dynamic discovery interface — three meta-tools that let AI assistants explore and execute any Square API operation across payments, orders, inventory, customers, loyalty, and more.

[Square](https://squareup.com/) was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvie, originally known for its iconic white card reader. The parent company rebranded to [Block, Inc.](https://block.xyz/) in December 2021. As of 2025: ~10,200 employees, $24.2B annual revenue, ~$36-40B market cap (NYSE: XYZ). Block was added to the S&P 500 in July 2025. The company operates Square (merchant services), Cash App (consumer finance), TIDAL (music streaming), and TBD (decentralized finance).

**Architecture note:** The repository is **auto-generated from Square's OpenAPI Specification**. This means contributions require upstream generator changes rather than direct code edits. The server exposes Square's entire REST API through three meta-tools rather than individual endpoint wrappers — a fundamentally different approach from most MCP servers.

## What It Does

The server provides **3 meta-tools** that dynamically access **40+ Square API services**:

### Core Tools

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| get_service_info | Discover available API services and their methods |
| get_type_info | Access parameter specifications and data types for any API method |
| make_api_request | Execute any Square API operation |

This meta-tool approach means the AI assistant first discovers what APIs are available, then learns the parameters needed, then executes the call. It's more flexible than fixed tool lists but requires the AI to do more reasoning.

### Available API Services (40+)

The server provides access to Square's complete API ecosystem:

**Payments & Commerce**
- **Payments** — Process, list, and manage card and digital wallet payments
- **Orders** — Create, update, search, and manage orders
- **Checkout** — Generate payment links and hosted checkout pages

## Setup & Configuration

### Remote Server (Recommended)

Square hosts a managed remote MCP server that handles OAuth authentication:

**Remote endpoint:**
```
https://mcp.squareup.com/sse
```

**Claude Desktop configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "square": {
      "url": "https://mcp.squareup.com/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude.ai (Teams/Enterprise/Max):**
Add the URL `https://mcp.squareup.com/sse` via Settings → Integrations or Settings → Profile.

The remote server uses **OAuth authentication** — you log in with your Square account directly. No manual token management needed. Note: the remote server accesses **production resources only**.

### Local Server

For sandbox testing or custom deployments:

```bash
npx square-mcp-server start
```

**Environment variables:**

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| ACCESS_TOKEN | Square API access token | Required |
| SANDBOX | Enable sandbox environment | false |
| PRODUCTION | Enable production environment | false |
| DISALLOW_WRITES | Read-only mode (no mutations) | false |
| SQUARE_VERSION | Square API version | Latest |

**Claude Desktop configuration (local):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "square": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["square-mcp-server", "start"],
      "env": {
        "ACCESS_TOKEN": "sq0atp-YOUR_TOKEN",
        "SANDBOX": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Supported AI Clients

- Claude Desktop / Claude.ai (Teams, Enterprise, Max)
- Goose (Block's own AI assistant)
- Cursor
- Windsurf

## Authentication

| Method | Deployment | Details |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| OAuth 2.0 | Remote server | Log in with Square account, granular permission scoping |
| Access Token | Local server | Manual token from Square Developer Dashboard |

The OAuth flow on the remote server is the recommended approach — it handles token management automatically and supports granular permission scoping. Square maintains an **allowlist of MCP clients** to prevent malicious server registration.

## Development History

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Feb 2025 | block/square-mcp created (Python, MIT) |
| Apr 2025 | square/square-mcp-server v0.1.2 released (TypeScript, Apache 2.0) |
| Apr 2025 | block/square-mcp archived, deprecated in favor of square/square-mcp-server |
| Jul 2025 | Block added to S&P 500 |
| 2025-2026 | Remote hosted server at mcp.squareup.com launched |

The original `block/square-mcp` (4 stars, Python, MIT license) was a simpler implementation that required manual access token configuration. Square replaced it with the current auto-generated TypeScript server under the `square` organization, adding OAuth support and the hosted remote server option.

## Pricing

The MCP server itself is free and open source (Apache 2.0). Standard Square transaction fees apply to API operations:

| Transaction Type | Fee (Free Plan) | Fee (Plus, $49/mo) | Fee (Premium, $149/mo) |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| In-person (tap, dip, swipe) | 2.6% + 15¢ | 2.5% + 10¢ | 2.4% + 15¢ |
| Online | 3.3% + 30¢ | 2.9% + 30¢ | 2.6% + 30¢ |
| Manually keyed | 3.5% + 15¢ | 3.5% + 15¢ | 3.5% + 15¢ |

No chargeback fees — a notable advantage over many competitors. Free plan has no monthly subscription cost; you only pay per-transaction fees.

## Alternatives Comparison

| Feature | Square MCP (Official) | block/square-mcp (Deprecated) | PayPal MCP | Stripe MCP |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------------|------------|------------|
| Maintainer | Square (Block, Inc.) | Block, Inc. | PayPal | Stripe |
| Status | Beta | Archived | Active | Active |
| Stars | 95 | 4 | 8 | 1,400+ |
| Language | TypeScript | Python | JavaScript/TypeScript | TypeScript |
| License | Apache 2.0 | MIT | Apache 2.0 | MIT |
| Tool approach | 3 meta-tools (dynamic) | Direct API wrappers | 30+ individual tools | Individual tools |
| Remote server | Yes (mcp.squareup.com) | No | Yes (PayPal-hosted) | No |
| OAuth | Yes | No | Yes | No |
| Sandbox support | Yes (local only) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| API coverage | 40+ services (full API) | Limited subset | 8 categories | Broad |

**Key differentiator:** Square's meta-tool approach gives access to the entire API surface through just 3 tools, while PayPal and Stripe expose individual tools per operation. This is more flexible but puts more burden on the AI to discover and correctly invoke operations.

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Beta status** — The server is officially in beta. APIs and behavior may change.

2. **Auto-generated code** — The repository is generated from Square's OpenAPI spec. You can't directly modify the server code; changes must go through Square's generator pipeline. Only 7 commits and minimal community contribution as a result.

3. **Remote server is production-only** — The hosted remote server at mcp.squareup.com only accesses production resources. For sandbox testing, you must run the local server with the SANDBOX flag.

4. **Meta-tool complexity** — The 3-tool dynamic discovery approach requires the AI to make multiple calls (discover → inspect → execute) for each operation, compared to direct-invocation servers. This can increase latency and token usage.

5. **Low community traction** — 95 stars compared to Stripe's 1,400+. Fewer community-reported issues means less visibility into real-world edge cases.

6. **Deprecated SSE transport** — The remote server uses the legacy SSE protocol. The MCP standard has moved to Streamable HTTP transport, and Square will need to update.

7. **Client allowlist** — Square maintains an allowlist of approved MCP clients. If your AI tool isn't on the list, you may not be able to use the remote server.

8. **No streaming responses** — API responses are returned as complete payloads rather than streamed, which can be slow for large result sets (e.g., listing thousands of catalog items).

## The Bottom Line

The Square MCP Server takes a distinctly different approach from competitors like PayPal and Stripe — instead of exposing dozens of individual tools, it wraps Square's entire 40+ service API ecosystem behind three meta-tools for dynamic discovery and execution. This gives it theoretically unlimited coverage of Square's platform, but at the cost of requiring more AI reasoning per operation.

The **hosted remote server with OAuth** is the standout feature — no tokens to manage, no local setup required, and it's one of the few MCP servers that offers a fully managed deployment option (alongside PayPal). The **DISALLOW_WRITES** flag is also a thoughtful safety feature for read-only exploration.

However, the beta status, auto-generated codebase (only 7 commits), and relatively low community engagement (95 stars) suggest this is still early. The production-only limitation on the remote server is a real friction point for developers who want to test safely.

**Rating: 3.5 / 5** — Official first-party from a major payments platform with innovative meta-tool architecture and managed hosting. Loses points for beta instability, limited community validation, auto-generated codebase that discourages contribution, and the production-only remote server constraint. If Square graduates this from beta with sandbox support on the remote server and updates to Streamable HTTP, it could easily be a 4.
