The Exa MCP server is Exa's official tool for connecting AI agents to their semantic search API. Where traditional search engines match keywords, Exa uses neural embeddings to understand what you're actually looking for — and the difference shows up in practice. Ask for "startups building developer tools for LLM observability" and Exa returns companies that match the *concept*, not just pages containing those exact words.

It's first-party, built and maintained by Exa at [exa-labs/exa-mcp-server](https://github.com/exa-labs/exa-mcp-server). With 4,000 GitHub stars, 301 forks, and 259 commits, it's one of the more actively developed MCP servers in the ecosystem. The MIT license means you can use it commercially without restrictions.

This is the second search-focused MCP server we've reviewed, after the [Brave Search MCP server](/reviews/brave-search-mcp-server/) (4/5). Where Brave gives you traditional web search at scale, Exa gives you semantic search with specialized verticals. Different tools for different jobs.

## What It Does

The server exposes 9 tools across three tiers:

**Enabled by Default (3 tools)**
- `web_search_exa` — Search the web using Exa's neural search engine. Returns cleaned, ready-to-use content with optional summaries and highlights. This is the core tool most agents will use.
- `get_code_context_exa` — Search specifically for code examples, documentation, and programming solutions from GitHub, Stack Overflow, and technical docs. Token-budgeted excerpts keep context manageable.
- `company_research_exa` — Research any company to get business information, news, insights, and structured metadata (headcount, location, funding, revenue).

**Disabled by Default (6 tools)**
- `web_search_advanced_exa` — Full control over filters: domain inclusion/exclusion, date ranges, text matching, and content extraction options. For when the basic search isn't precise enough.
- `crawling_exa` — Extract full page content from a known URL. Similar to our [Fetch MCP server](/reviews/fetch-mcp-server/), but through Exa's extraction pipeline.
- `people_search_exa` — Find people and professional profiles. Exa claims over 1 billion indexed profiles.
- `deep_researcher_start` — Launch an autonomous AI research agent that searches, reads, and synthesizes a detailed report. This is an asynchronous operation — you start it and check back.
- `deep_researcher_check` — Poll the status of a deep research task and retrieve the completed report.
- `deep_search_exa` — Deep search with query expansion and synthesized answers. Requires a personal API key (not available on the free tier).

The tool selection is configurable — you enable specific tools via URL parameters or CLI flags, so your agent only sees what it needs. This is a better design than dumping all tools on every agent and hoping it picks the right one.

### Search Categories

Beyond the default web search, Exa supports specialized search categories that change what gets indexed and what metadata is returned:

- **company** — Returns homepages with structured metadata (headcount, location, funding, revenue)
- **news** — Press coverage and announcements
- **tweet** — Social media presence and commentary
- **people** — LinkedIn profiles (public data only)
- **financial report** — SEC filings, earnings reports
- **research paper** — Academic papers with date filtering
- **personal site** — Blogs and portfolios

Each category has different filter restrictions. Company searches can't use domain or date filters. People searches can't use date filters. Financial report searches don't support `excludeText`. These restrictions aren't well-documented in the MCP server itself — you find out when a 400 error comes back.

### The Neural Search Difference

This is what separates Exa from traditional search APIs. On the WebWalker benchmark (complex multi-hop retrieval), Exa scores 81% versus Tavily's 71%. On multilingual queries (MKQA), the gap widens to 70% vs 63%. The p95 latency is 1.4–1.7 seconds versus Tavily's 3.8–4.5 seconds.

Exa also returns "query-dependent highlights" — instead of sending the entire page content, it extracts the passages most relevant to your specific query. This cuts token usage 50–75% while improving RAG accuracy, because you're not feeding your LLM five pages of text to find one relevant paragraph.

## Setup

Exa offers two installation paths:

### Hosted MCP Server (Recommended)

The simplest setup — no local installation required:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "exa": {
      "url": "https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

This works directly in Cursor, VS Code, and other clients that support remote MCP servers. The free tier gives you 1,000 requests/month with no API key needed.

For Claude Desktop, which doesn't support remote MCP natively, you need the `mcp-remote` wrapper:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "exa": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Local Installation (via npx)

For agents that need to run locally or in environments without external access:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "exa": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "exa-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "EXA_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To enable specific tools: `npx exa-mcp-server --tools=web_search_exa,crawling_exa`

To list all available tools: `npx exa-mcp-server --list-tools`

Setup is straightforward. The hosted server is the lowest-friction MCP server setup we've seen — even easier than Sentry's OAuth flow. One URL, no keys, no install.

## What Works

**Semantic search quality.** The neural search genuinely finds things keyword search misses. Searching for concepts, not just strings, is a meaningful upgrade for research-oriented agent workflows. The specialized categories (company, research paper, people) return structured data that a generic web search can't match.

**Query-dependent highlights.** Instead of returning full page content (which burns tokens and buries the answer), Exa extracts the passages relevant to your specific query. This is the right approach for LLM consumption — less context, better signal.

**Tool granularity.** Nine tools with selective enablement means you can give agents exactly the capabilities they need. An agent doing code search doesn't need company research tools cluttering its tool list. Most MCP servers dump everything; Exa lets you curate.

**Code search.** `get_code_context_exa` searches GitHub, Stack Overflow, and documentation specifically. Token-budgeted excerpts mean you get relevant code snippets without pulling entire files. For coding agents, this is more useful than a generic web search that happens to return some Stack Overflow results.

**Deep research.** The async deep researcher is genuinely useful for complex questions that require synthesizing multiple sources. It's not just search-and-concatenate — the research agent follows threads, reads pages, and produces structured reports. The start/check pattern handles the long latency (4–30 seconds) without blocking the agent.

**Free tier.** 1,000 requests/month for free, no API key required for the hosted server. That's enough to evaluate whether Exa fits your workflow before spending anything.

## What Doesn't Work

**Filter restrictions are silent until they fail.** Each search category has different filter limitations — company searches can't use domain filters, people searches can't use date filters, `includeText` and `excludeText` only accept single-item arrays (multi-item arrays return 400 errors). These restrictions aren't surfaced in the MCP tool descriptions. Your agent will try a reasonable-looking query and get an opaque error back.

**Tool selection has been buggy.** GitHub issues report that the `--tools` parameter for the local server doesn't always parse correctly — users get all tools regardless of their configuration. For the hosted server, tool selection via URL parameters works, but the local experience has friction.

**API cost complexity.** The pricing is per-operation and varies by mode: $7/1K searches, $12/1K for agentic deep mode, $1/1K pages for content, $5/1K for answers, plus add-ons for summaries ($1/1K) and reasoning ($3/1K). An agent that does research-heavy work — searching, reading pages, getting summaries — can rack up costs that are hard to predict. Compare this to Brave's flat $3/1K API calls.

**Hosted server timeouts.** The remote endpoint at `mcp.exa.ai` has had timeout issues — responses taking longer than 5 seconds caused failures in clients with aggressive timeouts. Exa addressed this in January 2026, but the local server (which hits `api.exa.ai` directly) is generally more reliable than the hosted MCP endpoint.

**No offline or self-hosted option.** Every search hits Exa's API. There's no way to run Exa locally or bring your own index. If Exa's API goes down or your network is restricted, the server is useless. The local npm package still makes API calls — it's just a different transport, not a different architecture.

**Claude Desktop friction.** Like many remote MCP servers, Claude Desktop requires the `mcp-remote` wrapper because it doesn't support remote servers natively. This is a Claude Desktop limitation, not Exa's fault, but it's still friction that a significant chunk of users will hit.

## Who Should Use This

**Research-heavy agent workflows.** If your agents do market research, competitive analysis, literature reviews, or any work that requires finding information across many sources and synthesizing it, Exa's semantic search and deep researcher are significantly better than keyword-based alternatives.

**Agents that need structured company or people data.** The company research and people search categories return structured metadata that generic search can't match. If you're building an agent that does lead research, competitive intelligence, or recruiting workflows, Exa is the right search backend.

**Coding agents that need contextual code search.** `get_code_context_exa` is more targeted than a generic web search for finding code examples, documentation, and solutions. The token-budgeted excerpts fit neatly into agent context windows.

## Who Shouldn't

**Cost-sensitive applications.** If you're doing high-volume search (10K+ queries/month), the per-operation pricing adds up fast, especially with content extraction and summaries. Brave Search ($3/1K) or Tavily ($8/1K credits) offer more predictable cost structures.

**Simple web fetching.** If you just need to read a specific URL, the [Fetch MCP server](/reviews/fetch-mcp-server/) or [Brave Search MCP server](/reviews/brave-search-mcp-server/) are simpler and cheaper. Exa's value is in *finding* information, not just *retrieving* it.

**Offline or restricted environments.** Exa requires internet access to its API. No API, no search. If you need search in air-gapped environments, look elsewhere.

## Alternatives

**[Brave Search MCP Server](/reviews/brave-search-mcp-server/)** (our review: 4/5) — Traditional keyword search at scale. Two tools (web_search, local_search), simpler pricing ($3/1K calls), 2,000 free queries/month. Better for straightforward search tasks where semantic understanding isn't critical. Exa wins when you need to search for *concepts* rather than *keywords*.

**Tavily** — Search API built for LLMs with structured JSON responses. Acquired by Nebius in February 2026, which introduces uncertainty about the product roadmap. Similar concept to Exa but with keyword-based search rather than neural embeddings. Exa outperforms on accuracy benchmarks (81% vs 71% on WebWalker).

**Perplexity Sonar** — Real-time web-connected search API from Perplexity. Returns synthesized answers with citations. Higher latency, higher cost, but produces ready-to-use answers rather than search results. Better when you want answers, not results to process.

**Linkup** — AI fact retrieval API that sources from trusted, authoritative sources. #1 on OpenAI's SimpleQA factuality benchmark. Flat, predictable pricing. Better for factual accuracy; Exa is better for broad research and discovery.

**[Fetch MCP server](/reviews/fetch-mcp-server/)** (our review: 3.5/5) — If you already know the URL and just need to read it, Fetch is simpler and free. No search capability though.

## The Verdict

{{< verdict rating="4" summary="The best search MCP server for research-heavy agent workflows — semantic search that genuinely understands concepts, not just keywords, with specialized verticals that return structured data. The pricing complexity and API dependency are real tradeoffs." >}}

Exa earns its 4/5 by doing something most search APIs don't: understanding what you mean, not just what you typed. The neural search quality is measurably better than keyword-based alternatives, the query-dependent highlights are the right approach for LLM token management, and the specialized search categories (company, research paper, people) unlock workflows that generic search can't support.

The deep researcher feature is a genuine differentiator — an autonomous research agent accessible through a two-tool async pattern. It's not just search; it's research-as-a-service.

The points it loses: pricing complexity makes costs hard to predict for agentic workflows where the number of searches varies per task, the filter restrictions fail silently with opaque errors, and the hosted endpoint has had reliability issues. These are execution problems, not architectural ones — Exa's approach to AI-native search is fundamentally sound.

If you're building agents that need to *find and understand* information rather than just *fetch known URLs*, Exa is the search server to start with.
