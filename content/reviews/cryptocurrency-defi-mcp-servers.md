Native token transfers, ERC20 operations, NFT queries, smart contract interactions, and ENS lookups across Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, Optimism, and more. **Solana has a dedicated agent ecosystem** — sendaifun/solana-mcp (153 stars, Apache-2.0) provides 40+ Solana-specific actions powered by the Solana Agent Kit (1,600 stars). SPL token management, transaction execution, wallet operations, and DeFi protocol interactions. dcSpark/mcp-cryptowallet-solana enables Solana wallet usage directly in Claude and Cursor. **Major wallets are launching MCP servers** — Phantom (official npm package, Solana+EVM, transaction signing, quote swapping, token transfers with scoped permissions), Trust Wallet (AI developer stack with MCP + Claude skills marketplace), Bitget Wallet (9+ networks including BNB/Base/Solana/Ethereum/Arbitrum/TON), and armorwallet/armor-crypto-mcp (Solana Alpha with 12+ chain support planned). This is a significant trend — the wallet providers themselves are building AI agent interfaces. **Multi-chain infrastructure spans 130+ networks** — strangelove-ventures/web3-mcp (93 stars, TypeScript, Apache-2.0) provides a unified interface for Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, THORChain, XRP, Bitcoin, and TON with balance checks and transaction execution. tatumio/blockchain-mcp (14 stars, TypeScript, MIT) connects to 130+ blockchain networks via the Tatum API for data queries and RPC gateway access. **DeFi protocol interaction is maturing** — nirholas/UCAI generates MCP servers from any smart contract ABI, enabling interaction with Uniswap, Aave, ERC20, and NFT contracts across EVM chains. Tairon-ai/aave-mcp provides production-ready Aave V3 operations on Base (supply, borrow, health factors, yield strategies). kukapay/uniswap-trader-mcp automates token swaps on Uniswap DEX across Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, Arbitrum, Celo, BNB, Avalanche, and Base. qingfeng/defi-rates-mcp tracks lending rates across 14+ protocols including Aave, Morpho, Compound on multiple chains. **Market data coverage is extensive** — coinpaprika/dexpaprika-mcp provides real-time data for 5M+ tokens across 20+ blockchains with DEX analytics. CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, and CoinCap MCP servers cover token prices, market caps, and trading volumes. CoinStatsHQ/coinstats-mcp adds portfolio tracking and news aggregation. Specialized servers track whale transactions (kukapay/whale-tracker-mcp), Fear & Greed Index (kukapay/crypto-feargreed-mcp), and crypto news (kukapay/cryptopanic-mcp-server). **Blockchain data and analytics are covered** — crazyrabbitLTC/mcp-etherscan-server provides Ethereum blockchain data including token balances, ENS resolution, and contract interactions. heurist-network/heurist-mesh-mcp-server offers on-chain analytics, token metrics, and smart contract security insights. **Bitcoin gets Lightning Network support** — AbdelStark/lightning-mcp enables Bitcoin payments via Lightning Network with invoice and balance operations. zebedeeio/zbd-mcp-server provides Lightning micropayments and reward distribution. magnetai/mcp-free-usdc-transfer enables gasless USDC transfers on Base using Coinbase MPC wallets. **OpenSea launches official NFT MCP** — OpenSea's beta MCP server provides AI agents with real-time NFT data across 20+ blockchains including collection verification, rarity scores, wallet balances, ownership patterns, trading volumes, and live marketplace activity. **Crime detection exists** — ChainGuard provides multi-chain crime detection and forensic analysis across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hedera, and Solana for security-focused applications. **Major gaps remain** — no centralized exchange trading execution (reading Binance data exists via snjyor/binance-mcp, but no order placement). No derivatives, options, or futures trading. No automated portfolio rebalancing. No crypto tax reporting or calculation. No cross-chain bridge execution. Limited smart contract audit tooling (Heurist provides some security insights). The biggest concern is security — giving AI agents wallet access raises real risks around unauthorized transactions, and most servers don't implement granular permission scoping (Phantom is the notable exception with scoped permissions). The category earns 4/5 — the cryptocurrency and DeFi MCP ecosystem is surprisingly mature. GOAT provides the broadest action coverage at 200+ integrations. Coinbase brings enterprise credibility. Major wallets (Phantom, Trust, Bitget) are building native MCP support. Multi-chain infrastructure covers everything from Bitcoin to TON. DeFi protocols like Aave and Uniswap have dedicated servers. Market data is well-covered from multiple angles. The main weaknesses are around trading execution (read-heavy, write-light), security granularity, and the absence of traditional exchange integration. But for reading blockchain data, managing wallets, and interacting with DeFi protocols, the ecosystem is genuinely strong."

Cryptocurrency and DeFi MCP servers let AI assistants interact directly with blockchain networks — checking balances, executing token swaps, managing wallets, querying DeFi protocol data, and tracking crypto markets. Instead of manually navigating block explorers and wallet interfaces, AI agents can handle on-chain operations through the Model Context Protocol.

This review covers the **cryptocurrency and DeFi** ecosystem — multi-chain infrastructure, Solana-specific tools, wallet integrations, DeFi protocols, market data, blockchain analytics, payments, and NFTs. For general finance servers, see our [Finance review](/reviews/finance-mcp-servers/).

The headline findings: **goat-sdk/goat (966 stars) provides 200+ onchain actions** as the largest agentic finance toolkit. **Coinbase/agentkit (1,200 stars) gives every AI agent a wallet** with enterprise backing. **Major wallets — Phantom, Trust Wallet, Bitget — are launching native MCP servers**. DeFi protocols like Aave and Uniswap have dedicated servers. Market data is well-covered from CoinGecko to whale tracking.

- Portfolio evaluation and token discovery

This is the first major NFT marketplace to ship official MCP support.

## Security & Forensics

| Server | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| ChainGuard | Multi-chain crime detection — Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hedera, Solana |

ChainGuard provides real-time blockchain crime detection and forensic analysis, useful for compliance and security-focused applications.

## What's Missing

The cryptocurrency and DeFi MCP ecosystem has notable gaps:

- **No centralized exchange trading** — you can read Binance market data but cannot place orders through any MCP server
- **No derivatives/options/futures** — DeFi options protocols (Lyra, Dopex) have no MCP coverage
- **No portfolio rebalancing** — no server automates cross-protocol or cross-chain portfolio management
- **No crypto tax reporting** — no integration with Koinly, CoinTracker, or similar tax tools
- **No cross-chain bridge execution** — reading bridge data exists but automated bridging is absent
- **Limited audit tooling** — Heurist provides some security insights but no comprehensive smart contract audit server
- **Security concerns** — giving AI agents wallet access raises real risks; only Phantom implements granular permission scoping

## The Bottom Line

The cryptocurrency and DeFi MCP ecosystem earns **4 out of 5**.

The category is surprisingly mature. GOAT provides the broadest action coverage at 200+ integrations. Coinbase brings enterprise credibility with agentkit. Major consumer wallets — Phantom, Trust Wallet, Bitget — are building native MCP support, signaling that wallet-AI integration is becoming standard. Multi-chain infrastructure covers everything from Bitcoin Lightning to TON. DeFi protocols like Aave and Uniswap have dedicated servers. Market data is well-covered from macro sentiment to whale tracking.

The main weaknesses: the ecosystem is read-heavy and write-light for traditional exchanges. You can check prices on Binance but cannot trade. DeFi execution exists (Uniswap swaps, Aave lending) but centralized exchange integration is missing. The security model for AI agents holding wallet keys remains immature — Phantom's scoped permissions are the exception, not the norm.

For blockchain data querying, wallet management, DeFi protocol interaction, and market intelligence, the MCP ecosystem is genuinely strong. For automated trading on centralized exchanges, you will need to wait.
