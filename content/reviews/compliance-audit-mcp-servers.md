card_description: "Compliance and audit MCP servers across compliance platforms, policy enforcement proxies, audit logging tools, and security standards. The Agentic MCP Gateway Registry (485 stars, 832 commits) is the most comprehensive enterprise governance solution — centralized OAuth, dynamic tool discovery, SOC 2/GDPR audit logging, YARA security scanning, and peer-to-peer registry federation. For compliance automation platforms, Vanta MCP (41 stars, 13 tools) gives AI agents read/write access to security controls, compliance tests, frameworks, and vulnerability tracking. SentinelGate (5 stars, Go, AGPL-3.0) is the most focused policy enforcement proxy — deterministic CEL-based rules, RBAC, budget controls, session recording, and complete audit trails. The category is nascent but growing fast — enterprises need audit trails and policy enforcement before they can deploy MCP at scale."

Compliance and audit is one of the most critical — and most underdeveloped — categories in the MCP ecosystem. Enterprises deploying MCP servers face a predictable set of compliance requirements: **audit trails** (what did the AI agent do?), **policy enforcement** (what is the agent allowed to do?), **access controls** (who authorized the agent?), and **compliance evidence** (can we prove we're meeting SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR, ISO 27001?). The tools in this category attempt to solve these problems from different angles. Part of our **[Security & Compliance MCP category](/categories/security-compliance/)**.

The landscape divides into six areas: **compliance automation platforms** (Vanta, Secureframe — query your compliance status through MCP), **MCP policy enforcement** (SentinelGate, Agent Identity Protocol — intercept and control tool calls), **MCP monitoring** (MCP Snitch, MCP Audit Extension — observe and log agent behavior), **MCP gateways with audit** (Microsoft MCP Gateway, Lasso MCP Gateway, Agentic MCP Gateway Registry — enterprise-grade routing with built-in audit trails), **MCP security auditing** (mcpserver-audit, mcp-security-audit — analyze MCP server code for vulnerabilities), and **security standards** (MCP Server Security Standard — certification framework for MCP servers).

The headline finding: **this category is nascent but enterprise-critical**. Most tools have single-digit to low-double-digit stars and fewer than 100 commits. But the problems they solve — audit trails, access control, policy enforcement — are the primary blockers preventing regulated industries from adopting MCP. **The Agentic MCP Gateway Registry is the most mature solution** (485 stars, 832 commits, Apache 2.0) with centralized OAuth, audit logging, YARA security scanning, and peer-to-peer federation. **Vanta MCP is the strongest compliance platform integration** — 13 tools covering the full SOC 2 lifecycle. **SentinelGate is the most focused policy enforcement tool** — deterministic CEL-based rules with complete audit trails. **The main gap is maturity** — most projects are under 6 months old with small contributor bases.

## Compliance Automation Platforms

### Vanta

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [VantaInc/vanta-mcp-server](https://github.com/VantaInc/vanta-mcp-server) | 41 | TypeScript | 13 | stdio |

**VantaInc/vanta-mcp-server** (41 stars, TypeScript, MIT, 96 commits) is Vanta's official MCP server. Thirteen consolidated tools cover the full compliance lifecycle:

**Tests and test entities** — query automated security tests and their status across compliance frameworks. **Controls** — manage security controls and their associated documentation. **Documents** — enumerate compliance documents and evidence. **Integrations** — explore connected service integrations and their resources. **Frameworks** — access framework adoption metrics and drill into specific requirements. **People** — personnel management and access reviews. **Risk and vulnerability tracking** — monitor risk scenarios with treatment plans and track vulnerabilities.

The project uses a "consolidated tool pattern" — the original design had 53 tools, reduced to 43, then consolidated further to 13 by using intelligent parameter handling. This is a smart architectural choice that keeps the tool surface manageable for LLM context windows while preserving full functionality. Actively maintained with 96 commits.

### Secureframe

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [secureframe/secureframe-mcp-server](https://github.com/secureframe/secureframe-mcp-server) | 6 | Python | 11 | stdio |

**secureframe/secureframe-mcp-server** (6 stars, Python, MIT, 6 commits) is Secureframe's official MCP server. Eleven read-only tools:

`list_controls`, `list_tests`, `list_users`, `list_devices`, `list_user_accounts`, `list_tprm_vendors`, `list_vendors`, `list_frameworks`, `list_repositories`, `list_integration_connections`, `list_repository_framework_scopes`.

Supports querying across SOC 2, ISO 27001, CMMC, FedRAMP, and other compliance frameworks. Uses Lucene query syntax for advanced filtering. Regional endpoint support (US and UK). Currently in public beta.

The contrast with Vanta is stark: Secureframe's server is strictly read-only (no write operations), has far fewer commits (6 vs. 96), and covers less surface area. For querying compliance status it works, but Vanta's server is significantly more capable. Both require paid platform subscriptions.

## MCP Policy Enforcement

### SentinelGate

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-----------|
| [Sentinel-Gate/Sentinelgate](https://github.com/Sentinel-Gate/Sentinelgate) | 5 | Go | AGPL-3.0 | MCP proxy |

**Sentinel-Gate/Sentinelgate** (5 stars, Go, AGPL-3.0, 7 commits, v1.1) is a universal firewall for AI agents. It intercepts MCP tool calls and evaluates them against deterministic policies before execution.

**Deterministic policy enforcement** — explicit rule-based allow/deny decisions, not probabilistic AI-based filtering. This is the correct approach for compliance — auditors want deterministic controls, not "the AI thought it was probably safe." **CEL-powered rules** — Common Expression Language for sophisticated policy conditions (e.g., "allow read operations on production databases only during business hours"). **RBAC** — role-based access control for agent identities. **Complete audit trail** — every action logged with identity, decision, timestamp, and arguments. **Budget controls** — per-identity usage limits including call caps, write restrictions, and rate limiting. **Response transformation** — five modification types: redaction, truncation, injection, dry-run, and masking. **Session recording** — full request/response capture with timeline replay and export. **Admin dashboard** — browser-based policy management. **Policy templates** — seven pre-configured security profiles.

The AGPL-3.0 license may be a concern for enterprises that want to embed this as a component without open-sourcing their own code. Only 7 commits and 5 stars — very early stage but architecturally sound.

### Agent Identity Protocol (AIP)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-----------|
| [openagentidentityprotocol/agentidentityprotocol](https://github.com/openagentidentityprotocol/agentidentityprotocol) | 18 | Go | Apache 2.0 | MCP proxy |

**openagentidentityprotocol/agentidentityprotocol** (18 stars, Go, Apache 2.0, 87 commits) is a zero-trust identity layer for MCP and autonomous agents. It provides authentication, attestation, authorization, and governance.

**Agent Authentication Token (AAT)** — cryptographic signing for agent identity, so every tool call is tied to a verified agent. **Policy enforcement proxy** — sidecar deployment that intercepts tool calls and evaluates them against YAML-based policies. **DLP scanning** — data loss prevention on both requests and responses, catching sensitive data before it leaks through tool calls. **Human-in-the-Loop** — approval dialogs for sensitive operations. **Immutable JSONL audit logging** — tied to agent identity for forensic traceability. **Tool allowlisting** — with argument validation per tool. **Revocation support** — through registry mechanisms.

V0.1 (Localhost Proxy) is stable. V0.2 (Kubernetes Sidecar) and v1.0 (OIDC/SPIFFE Federation) are in the roadmap. The 87 commits show more development maturity than most tools in this category. Apache 2.0 is enterprise-friendly. Supports Cursor IDE and Claude Desktop integration.

## MCP Monitoring

### MCP Snitch

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Platform |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|----------|
| [Adversis/mcp-snitch](https://github.com/Adversis/mcp-snitch) | 93 | Swift | GPL-3.0 | macOS |

**Adversis/mcp-snitch** (93 stars, Swift, GPL-3.0, 6 commits) is a macOS application that intercepts and monitors MCP server communications. The most popular tool in this category by star count.

**Real-time interception** — of both stdio and HTTP MCP transports. **AI-powered threat detection** — uses GPT-3.5 to analyze tool calls for security concerns. **Pattern-based detection** — for sensitive data exposure (credit cards, SSNs, API keys). **Comprehensive audit logging** — full request/response history. **Manual and automatic approval modes** — for tool calls. **Automatic server discovery** — reads Claude Desktop and Cursor configs to find MCP servers. **Secure API key storage** — via macOS Keychain.

The macOS-only limitation is significant — most production MCP deployments run on Linux servers, not developer laptops. The GPL-3.0 license (with commercial licensing available) and the reliance on GPT-3.5 for threat detection add friction. Still, for individual developers who want visibility into what their MCP servers are doing, this is the most accessible option. Only 6 commits despite 93 stars — the star count likely reflects interest in the concept more than production adoption.

### MCP Audit Extension

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Platform |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|----------|
| [Agentity-com/mcp-audit-extension](https://github.com/Agentity-com/mcp-audit-extension) | 26 | TypeScript | MIT | VS Code |

**Agentity-com/mcp-audit-extension** (26 stars, TypeScript, MIT, 44 commits) audits and logs all GitHub Copilot MCP tool calls in VS Code.

Creates mirrored "(tapped)" versions of configured MCP servers for transparent auditing. Supports multiple log forwarders: **Splunk HEC**, **CEF/Syslog**, and **local file logging**. Includes an MCP Audit Log viewer in the VS Code Explorer sidebar. Generates structured JSON logs with tool parameters, results, and metadata. Enterprise-ready with MDM/configuration management support.

This is the right approach for enterprise adoption — log MCP tool calls to existing SIEM infrastructure (Splunk, Syslog) rather than building a new logging pipeline. The VS Code/Copilot focus is narrow but hits a large user base.

## MCP Gateways with Audit

### Microsoft MCP Gateway

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-----------|
| [microsoft/mcp-gateway](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp-gateway) | 523 | C# (.NET) | — | HTTP |

**microsoft/mcp-gateway** (523 stars, C#/.NET, 36 commits) is a reverse proxy and management layer for MCP servers in Kubernetes environments.

**RESTful control plane APIs** — deploy and manage MCP servers programmatically. **Session-aware routing** — data plane gateway with session affinity. **Dynamic tool routing** — Tool Gateway Router for multi-server tool aggregation. **Azure Entra ID authentication** — with role-based authorization. **Kubernetes-native** — StatefulSet-based deployment.

The highest star count for any single project in this review (523). Microsoft's enterprise backing and Azure Entra ID integration make this the natural choice for organizations already on Azure. However, it's primarily a routing/management layer — audit logging is a feature, not the core purpose. 36 commits suggests this is still early despite the star count.

### Lasso MCP Gateway

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-----------|
| [lasso-security/mcp-gateway](https://github.com/lasso-security/mcp-gateway) | 353 | Python | — | MCP proxy |

**lasso-security/mcp-gateway** (353 stars, Python, 40 commits) is a plugin-based gateway that orchestrates other MCP servers with security guardrails.

**Request/response sanitization** — protects credentials from leaking through tool calls. **Plugin architecture** — four plugin options: Basic (token masking), Presidio (PII detection via Microsoft Presidio), Lasso (AI safety guardrails), and Xetrack (monitoring/tracing). **Unified interface** — discover and interact with proxied MCPs through a single endpoint. **Security scanning** — for server reputation and risk analysis.

Two tools: `get_metadata` (information about proxied MCPs) and `run_tool` (execute capabilities from any proxied MCP after sanitization). The PII detection via Microsoft Presidio is particularly relevant for GDPR compliance — it can catch personal data in MCP responses before they reach the LLM context.

### Agentic MCP Gateway Registry

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-----------|
| [agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry](https://github.com/agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry) | 485 | Python | Apache 2.0 | HTTP |

**agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry** (485 stars, Python, Apache 2.0, 832 commits) is the most comprehensive enterprise MCP governance solution in the category.

**Multi-provider IAM** — Keycloak and Microsoft Entra ID integration. **Dynamic semantic search** — across servers, tools, and agents. **Virtual MCP servers** — aggregating multiple backends. **MCP server versioning** — with instant rollback. **Agent Skills Registry** — reusable instruction sets. **Comprehensive audit logging** — for SOC 2/GDPR compliance. **Peer-to-peer registry federation** — across instances. **Security scanning** — via Cisco AI Defense tools with YARA pattern matching. **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol support** — for direct agent communication.

The 832 commits significantly outpace everything else in this category. DocumentDB and MongoDB CE storage backends. AWS ECS deployment with Terraform configuration. Includes MCP Registry CLI for conversational tool discovery, IAM settings UI for user/group management, and direct OTLP push export for metrics. This is the closest thing to "enterprise-ready MCP governance" that exists today.

## MCP Security Auditing

### mcpserver-audit

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-----------|
| [ModelContextProtocol-Security/mcpserver-audit](https://github.com/ModelContextProtocol-Security/mcpserver-audit) | 13 | — | — | — |

**ModelContextProtocol-Security/mcpserver-audit** (13 stars, 21 commits) is a Cloud Security Alliance project that audits MCP server source code for security vulnerabilities.

Scores vulnerabilities using **AIVSS (AI Vulnerability Scoring System)** — a specialized scoring framework for AI-specific threats. Maps findings to **CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)** categories. Integrates with **audit-db** (7 stars, 9 commits) — a community-maintained database of MCP server audit results and security assessments with standardized audit manifests and structured finding formats.

This is a "meta" tool — it doesn't help with compliance of your application, it helps you evaluate whether MCP servers themselves are safe to deploy. Useful for security teams vetting MCP server adoption.

### mcp-security-audit

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [qianniuspace/mcp-security-audit](https://github.com/qianniuspace/mcp-security-audit) | 52 | TypeScript | — | stdio |

**qianniuspace/mcp-security-audit** (52 stars, TypeScript, MIT, 23 commits, v1.0.4) audits npm package dependencies for security vulnerabilities.

Real-time vulnerability scanning against the remote npm registry. Detailed reports with severity classification (critical, high, moderate, low), CVSS scoring, and CVE references. Automatic fix recommendations. Compatible with npm, pnpm, and yarn. Docker support available.

A focused tool — it's an npm audit wrapped in MCP, not a compliance platform. But dependency vulnerability management is a compliance requirement for SOC 2 and ISO 27001, so it has a legitimate place in compliance workflows.

### Lighthouse MCP Server

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [danielsogl/lighthouse-mcp-server](https://github.com/danielsogl/lighthouse-mcp-server) | — | TypeScript | 13+ | stdio |

**danielsogl/lighthouse-mcp-server** enables AI agents to perform comprehensive web audits using Google Lighthouse — 13+ tools for performance, accessibility, SEO, and security analysis. Relevant for accessibility compliance (WCAG) and security auditing of web properties. Already covered in our [Performance & Load Testing MCP Servers](/reviews/performance-load-testing-mcp-servers/) review.

## Kubernetes Audit Logs

### kube-audit-mcp

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [mozillazg/kube-audit-mcp](https://github.com/mozillazg/kube-audit-mcp) | 19 | Go | 3 | stdio |

**mozillazg/kube-audit-mcp** (19 stars, Go, MIT, 46 commits, v0.4.1) enables AI agents to query Kubernetes audit logs from multiple cloud providers.

Three tools: **`query_audit_log`** — query with filtering by namespace, resource type, user, and action verbs. **`list_clusters`** — enumerate configured clusters. **`list_common_resource_types`** — display available resource types.

Multi-cloud support: AWS CloudWatch Logs, Google Cloud Logging, and Alibaba Cloud Log Service. Compatible with Claude Desktop, VS Code, Gemini CLI, and kubectl-ai. Docker containerization available. YAML-based configuration.

The tool count is small but the use case is focused — Kubernetes audit logs are a compliance requirement for SOC 2 and ISO 27001 in containerized environments. Having AI agents query these logs through natural language makes compliance investigation significantly faster.

## Security Standards

### MCP Server Security Standard (MSSS)

| Project | Stars | License | Controls | Levels |
|---------|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| [mcp-security-standard/mcp-server-security-standard](https://github.com/mcp-security-standard/mcp-server-security-standard) | 69 | CC BY-SA 4.0 | 24 | 4 |

**MCP Server Security Standard** (69 stars, CC BY-SA 4.0 for the standard text, Apache 2.0 for schemas, MIT for code examples, 20 commits) is an open, testable security control standard for certifying MCP servers.

**24 security controls** spanning 8 domains: Filesystem, Execution, Network, Authorization, Input Validation, Logging, Supply Chain, and Deployment. **4 compliance levels**:

| Level | Controls | Validation | Timeline |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------|
| L1: Essential | 6 (25%) | Self-assessment | 1-2 hours |
| L2: Development | 12 (50%) | Self + scanning | 4-8 hours |
| L3: Production | 18 (75%) | Internal audit | 1-2 weeks |
| L4: Maximum Assurance | 24 (100%) | Third-party pentest | 4-8 weeks |

**6 deployment profiles** for various scenarios. **Machine-readable reporting** via JSON schemas. **Evidence-based verification** with clear acceptance criteria. Inspired by NIST CSF, OWASP ASVS, and CIS Controls.

This isn't an MCP server — it's a certification framework. But it's the most structured attempt to define what "secure" means for MCP servers, and compliance teams evaluating MCP adoption will likely reference it. The risk-based level selection model is practical — not every MCP server needs Level 4 certification.

## What's missing

The compliance and audit MCP category has significant gaps:

**No HIPAA-specific MCP tooling** — healthcare organizations deploying MCP have no purpose-built compliance tools. HIPAA's audit trail requirements (access logs for PHI, minimum necessary access enforcement) would benefit from MCP-native implementation.

**No unified compliance dashboard** — Vanta and Secureframe solve their own platforms' needs, but there's no MCP server that aggregates compliance status across multiple frameworks and providers.

**No OPA/Rego integration** — Open Policy Agent is the industry standard for policy-as-code in cloud-native environments. An MCP server exposing OPA policy evaluation would bridge the gap between existing policy infrastructure and AI agent governance.

**No real-time alerting** — the audit tools log events, but none trigger real-time alerts when policy violations occur. SentinelGate blocks violations but doesn't alert on patterns.

**No compliance-as-code for MCP** — there's no equivalent of `terraform plan` for MCP deployments that would show "this change will violate your SOC 2 controls."

## The bottom line

The compliance and audit MCP category is early-stage but addresses the #1 blocker for enterprise MCP adoption: **governance**. The tools exist across six subcategories, but most are under 6 months old with small contributor bases. The Agentic MCP Gateway Registry (485 stars, 832 commits) is the most mature enterprise solution. Vanta MCP (41 stars, 13 tools) is the strongest compliance platform integration. SentinelGate is the most focused policy enforcement tool despite only 5 stars and 7 commits. The MCP Server Security Standard provides the most structured certification framework.

For enterprises evaluating MCP compliance: start with the **Agentic MCP Gateway Registry** for centralized governance, add **Vanta or Secureframe MCP** for compliance platform integration, and consider **Agent Identity Protocol** for zero-trust agent identity if you need cryptographic audit trails. Watch this category closely — it will mature rapidly as enterprise MCP adoption accelerates.

**Rating: 3.5/5** — The tools address real enterprise needs and several are architecturally sound, but the category's immaturity (low commit counts, small contributor bases, limited production deployments) and fragmentation across six subcategories prevent a higher rating. The gap between what enterprises need and what's available today is still wide.
