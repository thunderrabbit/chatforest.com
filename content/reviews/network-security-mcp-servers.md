Network security is one of the most powerful — and most dangerous — applications of MCP. AI agents that can capture packets, scan ports, run vulnerability assessments, and perform reconnaissance have enormous potential for security professionals. They also have enormous potential for misuse. Every server in this review should be used only with proper authorization on systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Part of our **[Security & Compliance MCP category](/categories/security-compliance/)**.

The headline finding: **this is a fragmented but active space**. PortSwigger's official Burp Suite MCP server (536 stars) is the highest-credibility entry. For packet capture, WireMCP (380 stars) leads but has a known command injection vulnerability. The all-in-one winners are FuzzingLabs' mcp-security-hub (20+ tools covering Nmap, Ghidra, Nuclei, SQLMap, and more) and dkruyt/mcp-nettools (11 tools for everyday network diagnostics). For distributed testing, Globalping stands alone — a remote MCP server running from thousands of probes worldwide with no local installation required.

## Packet Capture & Traffic Analysis

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [0xKoda/WireMCP](https://github.com/0xKoda/WireMCP) | ~380 | Python | 3 | stdio |
| [khuynh22/mcp-wireshark](https://github.com/khuynh22/mcp-wireshark) | — | Python | 5+ | stdio |
| [mixelpixx/Wireshark-MCP](https://github.com/mixelpixx/Wireshark-MCP) | — | Python | Multiple | stdio |

**0xKoda/WireMCP** (380 stars, Python, March 2025) is the most popular Wireshark MCP server by adoption. Three tools: `capture_packets` (real-time traffic capture as JSON), `get_summary_stats` (protocol hierarchy statistics), and `get_conversations` (TCP/UDP conversation tracking). Enables agents to capture and analyze network traffic without leaving the conversation. **Critical caveat**: Issue #12 documents a command injection vulnerability — user-supplied parameters are passed unsanitized to shell commands. Do not use this on untrusted input or in production environments without patching. Despite this, it's the most straightforward path to AI-assisted packet analysis.

**khuynh22/mcp-wireshark** (Python 3.10+, pip-installable via `pip install mcp-wireshark`) is the most polished Wireshark MCP server from an engineering standpoint. Live capture, PCAP file parsing, display filter support, stream following, and JSON export. Published on PyPI with proper packaging — no git cloning required. Cross-platform, typed, and tested. If you need Wireshark integration in production workflows, this is the safer choice over WireMCP.

**mixelpixx/Wireshark-MCP** combines Wireshark analysis with nmap scanning and threat intelligence lookups in a single server. AI-powered network troubleshooting that correlates packet data with vulnerability data. Less adopted but more ambitious in scope.

**Also notable**: kriztalz/SharkMCP (tshark-based capture and analysis) and sarthaksiddha/Wireshark-mcp (bridges low-level network data with AI understanding).

## Port Scanning & Network Diagnostics

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [dkruyt/mcp-nettools](https://github.com/dkruyt/mcp-nettools) | — | Python | 11 | stdio |
| [jsdelivr/globalping-mcp-server](https://github.com/jsdelivr/globalping-mcp-server) | ~44 | TypeScript | 5 | Streamable HTTP |
| [kumarprobeops/probeops-mcp-server](https://github.com/kumarprobeops/probeops-mcp-server) | — | TypeScript | 11-21 | stdio |
| [PhialsBasement/nmap-mcp-server](https://github.com/PhialsBasement/nmap-mcp-server) | ~43 | TypeScript | 1 | stdio |
| [patrickdappollonio/mcp-netutils](https://github.com/patrickdappollonio/mcp-netutils) | — | Go | 6+ | stdio + SSE |

**dkruyt/mcp-nettools** (Python, installable via uv) is the best all-in-one network diagnostics MCP server. **11 tools**: `nmap_scan`, `dns_lookup`, `dns_enum`, `whois_info`, `traceroute`, `port_check`, `ssl_scan`, `network_scan`, `ip_geolocation`, `http_headers`, and `my_public_ip`. Covers the most common network troubleshooting tasks in a single server — DNS, WHOIS, scanning, SSL analysis, and geolocation. If you want one server for everyday network work, this is it.

**jsdelivr/globalping-mcp-server** (44 stars, TypeScript, backed by jsDelivr) is architecturally unique — a **remote MCP server** at `https://mcp.globalping.dev/mcp` that runs diagnostics from thousands of globally distributed probes. Five tools: ping, traceroute, DNS, MTR, and HTTP tests. No local installation needed. OAuth and API token authentication. When you need to test how your service responds from different geographic locations, nothing else in the MCP ecosystem comes close. Streamable HTTP transport means it works with modern MCP clients without stdio overhead.

**kumarprobeops/probeops-mcp-server** (TypeScript, via npx) offers 11 free tools (21 with API key) including SSL checks, DNS lookups, ping, WHOIS, port checks, traceroute, latency tests, and geo-located web browsing. Runs tests simultaneously from **6 global regions** (US East/West, EU Central, Canada, India, Australia). Similar to Globalping but includes more tools and a generous free tier.

**PhialsBasement/nmap-mcp-server** (43 stars, TypeScript, npm) wraps nmap in a single flexible `run_nmap_scan` tool with quick scan, full port scan, version detection, and custom timing templates. Simple and focused — if you just want nmap access from your agent, this works. Windows-focused documentation. Requires nmap installed locally.

**patrickdappollonio/mcp-netutils** (Go) provides DNS lookups (DNS-over-HTTPS via Cloudflare/Google fallback), WHOIS queries, connectivity testing, TLS certificate analysis, HTTP endpoint monitoring, and hostname resolution. Notable for supporting both stdio and HTTP/SSE transport on port 3000. Go binary — no runtime dependencies.

**Also notable**: imjdl/nmap-mcpserver (Python nmap wrapper).

## Penetration Testing Suites

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [FuzzingLabs/mcp-security-hub](https://github.com/FuzzingLabs/mcp-security-hub) | — | Python | 20+ | stdio |
| [DMontgomery40/pentest-mcp](https://github.com/DMontgomery40/pentest-mcp) | — | TypeScript | Multiple | stdio + HTTP + SSE |
| [0x4m4/hexstrike-ai](https://github.com/0x4m4/hexstrike-ai) | — | Python | 150+ | stdio + HTTP |
| [ramkansal/pentestMCP](https://github.com/ramkansal/pentestMCP) | — | Python | 20+ | stdio |
| [neptune1212/MCP_servers_cybersecurity](https://github.com/neptune1212/MCP_servers_cybersecurity) | — | Python | Multiple | stdio |

**FuzzingLabs/mcp-security-hub** (Python) is the most comprehensive offensive security MCP server. **20+ tools** covering: **Reconnaissance** (Nmap, Masscan, Shodan, WhatWeb), **Web security** (Nikto, FFUF, SQLMap, Burp Suite wrapper), **Binary analysis** (Ghidra, Radare2, Binwalk, YARA, Capa), **Password cracking** (Hashcat), and **Vulnerability scanning** (Nuclei). Modular architecture — enable only the tool categories you need. Also covers blockchain security. If you're building a security-focused AI agent and want one server to rule them all, this is the strongest candidate.

**DMontgomery40/pentest-mcp** (TypeScript, npm) covers nmap, gobuster/dirbuster, nikto, John the Ripper, hashcat, and wordlist building. The standout feature: **full transport support** — stdio, HTTP (primary), and SSE (deprecated compatibility mode). This is the only pentest MCP server supporting all three transports. Also notable: GPU-accelerated hashcat cracking for WPA/WPA2, NTLM, bcrypt, and 300+ hash types.

**0x4m4/hexstrike-ai** is the most ambitious entry — **150+ cybersecurity tools** organized across 12+ autonomous AI agents with a Flask API backend. Covers pentesting, vulnerability discovery, and bug bounty workflows. Multi-agent architecture means specialized agents handle different security domains. The tool count is staggering, though adoption and maturity are unclear.

**ramkansal/pentestMCP** (Python, Docker-based) bundles 20+ tools including Nmap, Nuclei, ZAP, SQLMap, Gobuster, and AJAX Spider. Uses an async launch/fetch pattern for long-running scans — important because security scans often take minutes, not seconds. Concurrency control via semaphores prevents overwhelming target systems.

**neptune1212/MCP_servers_cybersecurity** (Python, Dockerized) includes Metasploit RPC integration alongside Nmap, SQLMap, Nikto, WPScan, Gobuster, and Dirb. The only pentest MCP server with **Metasploit** and **WPScan** support — useful for WordPress security audits and exploit development in authorized testing environments.

## Web Application Security

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [PortSwigger/mcp-server](https://github.com/PortSwigger/mcp-server) | ~536 | Kotlin | Multiple | HTTP + stdio proxy |
| [LisBerndt/zap-mcp-server](https://github.com/LisBerndt/zap-mcp-server) | ~5 | Python | 5+ | stdio |
| [dtkmn/mcp-zap-server](https://github.com/dtkmn/mcp-zap-server) | — | Java/Kotlin | 4+ | HTTP |
| [cyproxio/mcp-for-security](https://github.com/cyproxio/mcp-for-security) | — | TypeScript | Multiple | stdio |

**PortSwigger/mcp-server** (536 stars, Kotlin, official) is the highest-credibility security MCP server in the entire ecosystem. Runs as a **Burp Suite extension** — HTTP request/response handling, vulnerability testing, traffic analysis, and Burp configuration. Tools toggled via the Burp UI. Runs on localhost:9876 with a stdio proxy for Claude Desktop compatibility. The official vendor backing means this will be maintained as long as Burp Suite exists. If your security team already uses Burp, this integration turns your AI agent into an intelligent testing assistant that can craft requests, analyze responses, and identify vulnerabilities within Burp's established workflow.

**LisBerndt/zap-mcp-server** (5 stars, Python) connects AI agents to OWASP ZAP — active scanning, passive scanning, AJAX spider, traditional spider, and session management. Configurable scan policies and evidence collection. ZAP is free and open source, making this the most accessible web security scanner integration. Low adoption but functional.

**dtkmn/mcp-zap-server** (Java/Kotlin, Spring Boot 4.0.3) is the enterprise-flavored ZAP integration — spider, active scan, OpenAPI spec import, and report generation. HTTP transport via Spring Boot, ZAP Client API 1.17.0. Better suited for CI/CD integration where you want to trigger ZAP scans from an agent in an automated pipeline.

**cyproxio/mcp-for-security** (TypeScript) provides modular per-tool MCP servers covering SQLMap, FFUF, NMAP, Masscan, web screenshots, HTTP header analysis (OWASP), web crawling, and mobile app security. The OWASP header analysis is unique — evaluates security headers against OWASP recommendations.

## SSL/TLS Certificate Analysis

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [wouter-bon/CERT-MCP-SERVER](https://github.com/wouter-bon/CERT-MCP-SERVER) | — | Python | 30 | stdio + HTTP |
| [malaya-zemlya/tls-mcp](https://github.com/malaya-zemlya/tls-mcp) | — | Python | 1 | stdio |
| [firesh/sslmon-mcp](https://github.com/firesh/sslmon-mcp) | — | — | 2 | stdio |

**wouter-bon/CERT-MCP-SERVER** (Python, 30 tools) is the only MCP server for full certificate lifecycle management. Let's Encrypt certificate provisioning with Cloudflare DNS-01 challenges. Manages certificates on **FortiGate, FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer, Windows, and Linux** systems. Both stdio and REST API transports. This isn't just certificate analysis — it's certificate operations. If you manage SSL certificates across enterprise infrastructure, this turns certificate renewal from a manual process into an agent-driven workflow.

**malaya-zemlya/tls-mcp** (Python) is a focused TLS analysis tool — auto-selects between OpenSSL and Python cryptography backends, provides expiration monitoring, cipher suite analysis, security grading, and zlint integration. A single `fetch_certificate` tool with flexible options. Written entirely via Claude Code — a nice meta-touch. Best for quick TLS health checks.

**firesh/sslmon-mcp** offers two tools: `get_domain_info` and `get_ssl_cert_info`. Domain registration details plus SSL expiry date checking with days-until-expiry calculation. Lightweight and focused on the monitoring/alerting use case — "which certificates are about to expire?"

## Network Reconnaissance

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [BurtTheCoder/mcp-shodan](https://github.com/BurtTheCoder/mcp-shodan) | ~126 | TypeScript | Multiple | stdio |
| [nickpending/mcp-censys](https://github.com/nickpending/mcp-censys) | — | Python | Multiple | stdio |
| [addcontent/nuclei-mcp](https://github.com/addcontent/nuclei-mcp) | — | — | Multiple | stdio |
| [RobertoDure/mcp-vulnerability-scanner](https://github.com/RobertoDure/mcp-vulnerability-scanner) | — | — | Multiple | stdio |

**BurtTheCoder/mcp-shodan** (126 stars, TypeScript) connects agents to Shodan's internet-wide scanning database — IP reconnaissance, DNS operations, CVE/CPE vulnerability intelligence, and device discovery. Shodan sees every internet-facing device. Combined with an AI agent, this enables natural-language queries like "find all exposed Redis instances on our subnet" or "what CVEs affect this IP's running services." Requires a Shodan API key (free tier available with rate limits).

**nickpending/mcp-censys** (Python) provides domain, IP, and FQDN reconnaissance via the Censys Search API. Similar to Shodan but with Censys's own internet-wide scanning perspective. Useful as a complementary data source — Shodan and Censys often discover different services on the same hosts.

**addcontent/nuclei-mcp** provides context-aware Nuclei vulnerability scanning with template management. Nuclei (by ProjectDiscovery) is one of the most popular open-source vulnerability scanners with thousands of community templates covering CVEs, misconfigurations, and exposed panels.

**RobertoDure/mcp-vulnerability-scanner** runs single or batch IP vulnerability scanning via Nmap plus API checks, with severity levels and remediation steps in reports. Good for quick vulnerability assessments with actionable output.

## Decision Guide

**For everyday network diagnostics**: Start with **dkruyt/mcp-nettools** — 11 tools covering DNS, WHOIS, scanning, SSL, and geolocation in one server. If you need globally distributed testing, add **Globalping**.

**For packet analysis**: **khuynh22/mcp-wireshark** if you want production-quality pip-installable tooling. **WireMCP** if you want the most popular option (but patch the command injection vulnerability first).

**For web application security testing**: **PortSwigger/mcp-server** if your team uses Burp Suite — official vendor backing and the most starred server in this category. **LisBerndt/zap-mcp-server** for free/open-source ZAP integration.

**For comprehensive pentesting**: **FuzzingLabs/mcp-security-hub** for the broadest tool coverage in a single server. **pentest-mcp** if you need multi-transport support or GPU-accelerated password cracking.

**For SSL/TLS management**: **CERT-MCP-SERVER** for certificate lifecycle operations across enterprise infrastructure. **tls-mcp** for quick analysis and health checks.

**For reconnaissance**: **mcp-shodan** for internet-wide device and vulnerability intelligence. Add **mcp-censys** for complementary scanning data.

## The Security Elephant in the Room

Every server in this review wraps tools that can cause real harm if misused. Unlike a database MCP server where the worst case is a dropped table, a misconfigured pentest MCP server could scan production systems without authorization, exfiltrate network data, or trigger intrusion detection alerts. None of these servers implement authorization boundaries beyond what their underlying tools provide.

**Before installing any of these**: ensure you have written authorization to test the target systems, understand the legal implications in your jurisdiction, and limit tool access to authorized personnel only. The MCP ecosystem currently has no standard for security tool authorization — each server trusts that the agent (and the human behind it) will use it responsibly.

## Rating: 3.5/5

The network security MCP ecosystem is active and growing, with strong entries from official vendors (PortSwigger/Burp Suite) and comprehensive community suites (FuzzingLabs, pentest-mcp). The distributed diagnostics category (Globalping, ProbeOps) is genuinely innovative — remote MCP servers that provide global network visibility without local tool installation. However, the space is fragmented (30+ servers with significant overlap), several servers have known security vulnerabilities (ironic for security tools), adoption is low outside of Burp Suite's MCP server, and there's no standardized approach to authorization or safety controls. The packet capture servers work but need security hardening. The pentest suites are powerful but require careful deployment. For security professionals with proper authorization, these tools meaningfully accelerate workflows — but the ecosystem needs maturation before it's ready for widespread adoption.
