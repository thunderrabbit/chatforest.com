card_description: "Regex and text processing MCP servers for AI-powered pattern matching, text comparison, translation, format conversion, grammar checking, and encoding. **Document conversion dominates this category** — zcaceres/markdownify-mcp (2,400 stars, TypeScript) converts PDFs, images, audio, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, YouTube transcripts, and web pages to Markdown through 10 dedicated tools. It's the highest-starred server in this category by far. vivekVells/mcp-pandoc (507 stars, Python) wraps Pandoc for bidirectional conversion between PDF, HTML, Markdown, DOCX, RST, EPUB, and LaTeX with YAML defaults and filter support. Microsoft's official markitdown-mcp (part of the 82K-star markitdown project) provides a lightweight STDIO/HTTP/SSE server with a single convert_to_markdown tool accepting any http:, https:, file:, or data: URI. Duds/md-converter handles the reverse direction — Markdown to DOCX, XLSX, PPTX with Excel formula support and MCP server interface. wowyuarm/file-converter-mcp (23 stars, Python) offers DOCX-to-PDF, PDF-to-DOCX, image format conversion, and Excel-to-CSV. **Diff and text comparison has strong coverage** — benjamine/jsondiffpatch's diff-mcp package (part of the 5,100-star jsondiffpatch library) is the most capable, comparing text using Google's diff-match-patch algorithm and supporting structured data comparison for JSON, JSON5, YAML, TOML, XML, and HTML with multiple output formats. samihalawa/mcp-server-diff-editor (5 stars, JS) provides 12 tools across diff operations, merge operations, and analysis — including semantic comparison, pattern recognition, and automated conflict resolution. tatn offers both TypeScript and Python implementations for unified diff generation. keyhoffman/diff-mcp gives Claude proper diffing via a local server running diff under the hood. **Translation is well-served by official providers** — DeepLcom/deepl-mcp-server (95 stars, JS) is the official DeepL MCP with 8 tools: text translation, document translation (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, HTML, TXT), text rephrasing with style control, glossary integration for consistent terminology, and formality controls. translated/lara-mcp (79 stars, TypeScript) provides Lara Translate API access with 10+ tools spanning translation, glossary management, and translation memory (store/retrieve past translations, TMX import) — unique among translation MCPs for its memory feature. ytarfa/tolgee-mcp wraps the Tolgee localization platform for managing translation keys, languages, and machine translation triggers via Google Translate, DeepL, or AWS Translate. **Regex testing is niche but functional** — PatzEdi/MCPGex (5 stars, Python) provides 4 tools for iterative regex development: add test cases, test patterns against them, review cases, and clear — designed for systematic pattern refinement where LLMs define expected outcomes and iterate until all pass. myuon/refactor-mcp (6 stars, TypeScript) offers 2 tools for regex-based code search and replace with capture groups, context patterns, and glob filtering — practical for automated refactoring. RJTPP/mcp-server-file-search-tool provides regex content search across files with security restrictions and path tokenization. **Encoding and cryptography** — 1595901624/crypto-mcp (10 stars, TypeScript) is the most complete encoding MCP with 14 tools: AES-128 and DES-64 encryption/decryption (ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, CTR modes, 6 padding options), 6 hash algorithms (MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512), and Base64/Hex encoding/decoding. This is useful for AI agents working with encoded data, generating hashes, or testing encryption. **Grammar and spelling** — morahan/SpellChecker-MCP (TypeScript) provides 7 tools for multilingual spell checking across 15+ languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, and more) with syntax-aware parsing for code files — it can check spelling in comments and strings while ignoring code. acforu/grammar-police-mcp (JS) takes a different approach, using Claude's own language understanding for grammar correction rather than rule-based checking. Neither matches LanguageTool's capabilities, but SpellChecker-MCP is useful for batch operations. **Character-level text manipulation** — agent-hanju/char-index-mcp (1 star, Python) fills a specific LLM gap with 12 tools for precise character positioning: find nth character/substring occurrences, split at indices, insert/delete/replace at positions, regex matching, and batch extraction. tivaliy/mcp-nlp (Python) provides text similarity measurement via Levenshtein distance and other algorithms. tumf/mcp-text-editor (177 stars, Python) offers line-based file operations with conflict detection — useful for collaborative editing. **Code maintenance** — yhzion/comment-stripper-mcp (TypeScript) batch-strips comments from JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, Python, Java, C#, C++, Ruby, PHP, and CSS/SCSS/LESS files using regex patterns — built with TDD methodology. **Multi-tool servers** — Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_mcp_server (129 stars, Python) wraps ripgrep, awk, sed, and jq as MCP tools alongside dozens of other capabilities. **Gaps remain** — no LanguageTool MCP for comprehensive grammar/style checking across 25+ languages, no Jinja/Handlebars template engine MCP, no dedicated OCR MCP (markdownify-mcp has some OCR via image conversion), no unified text processing pipeline, and no i18n-focused MCP beyond translation."

Regex and text processing MCP servers let AI agents test regex patterns, compare and diff text, translate content, convert between document formats, check grammar and spelling, and handle encoding operations. Instead of manually running regex testers, diff tools, or format converters, AI assistants can process text through natural language commands.

This review covers **regex and text processing MCP servers** — document conversion, diff/comparison, translation, regex testing, encoding/cryptography, grammar/spelling, and text manipulation. For related servers, see our [Browser Automation review](/reviews/playwright-mcp-server/) (web content extraction), [Search reviews](/reviews/brave-search-mcp-server/) (web search), and [Terminal & CLI Tools review](/reviews/terminal-cli-tools-mcp-servers/) (command-line text processing).

The headline findings: **Document conversion dominates** — markdownify-mcp (2,400 stars) and mcp-pandoc (507 stars) handle nearly any format. **Translation has strong official support** — DeepL and Lara Translate provide production-grade MCPs. **Diff tools are plentiful** — jsondiffpatch's diff-mcp covers text and structured data. **Regex testing is functional but niche** with only a few dedicated servers. **Grammar/spelling lacks a LanguageTool MCP**, leaving a significant gap.

- **Middleware-style** — processes input before Claude generates responses
- **Works with Claude Desktop and Claude Code**
- **No API key needed** — leverages the existing LLM connection

Lightweight approach, but limited to English and dependent on Claude's own capabilities.

---

## Text Manipulation & NLP

### agent-hanju/char-index-mcp — Character-Level String Operations

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [char-index-mcp](https://github.com/agent-hanju/char-index-mcp) | 1 | Python | — | 12 |

**Addresses a specific LLM weakness** — precise character positioning:

- **Character/substring discovery** (4 tools) — find nth occurrence, find all indices
- **String segmentation** (1 tool) — split at multiple positions
- **Text editing** (3 tools) — insert, delete, replace at exact indices
- **Advanced utilities** (3 tools) — regex matching, marker-based extraction, character statistics
- **Batch operations** (1 tool) — extract multiple substrings with position data

LLMs generate tokens, not characters — they struggle with exact character counting. This server fills that gap for test generation and XML parsing.

### Other Text Tools

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Focus |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-------|
| [tivaliy/mcp-nlp](https://github.com/tivaliy/mcp-nlp) | — | Python | 2 | Text similarity via Levenshtein distance and other metrics |
| [tumf/mcp-text-editor](https://github.com/tumf/mcp-text-editor) | 177 | Python | 3+ | Line-based file editing with conflict detection |
| [yhzion/comment-stripper-mcp](https://github.com/yhzion/comment-stripper-mcp) | — | TypeScript | 3+ | Batch comment removal from 10+ languages (JS, Python, Java, C++, etc.) |
| [Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_mcp_server](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_mcp_server) | 129 | Python | 40+ | Multi-tool server with ripgrep, awk, sed, jq text processing |

---

## What's Missing

The regex and text processing MCP landscape has solid coverage for document conversion and translation but notable gaps elsewhere:

- **No LanguageTool MCP** — the open-source grammar/style checker for 25+ languages has no MCP wrapper. This is the biggest gap — LanguageTool (12K+ stars) is the gold standard for multilingual proofreading
- **No template engine MCP** — no Jinja, Handlebars, or Mustache MCP for server-side template rendering
- **No dedicated OCR MCP** — markdownify-mcp handles some OCR through image conversion, but there's no Tesseract or dedicated OCR server
- **No unified text pipeline** — no single server combining regex, diff, format conversion, and transformation in one coherent workflow
- **No i18n pipeline** — translation exists but no comprehensive internationalization tooling (plural rules, locale-aware formatting, translation file management)
- **Limited NLP** — mcp-nlp offers basic text similarity but nothing for entity extraction, sentiment analysis, or text classification

---

## Bottom Line

**Rating: 3.5/5** — Document conversion and translation are genuinely strong. The rest of the category is scattered across small, focused servers that each solve one problem well but don't form a cohesive ecosystem.

**Best in class:**
- **Document conversion:** zcaceres/markdownify-mcp (2,400 stars) for to-Markdown, vivekVells/mcp-pandoc (507 stars) for between-formats
- **Translation:** DeepLcom/deepl-mcp-server (95 stars) for quality, translated/lara-mcp (79 stars) for memory
- **Diff:** benjamine/jsondiffpatch diff-mcp for text + structured data comparison

**If you only install one:** markdownify-mcp solves the most common text processing need — getting documents into a format your LLM can work with.
