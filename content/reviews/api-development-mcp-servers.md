OpenAPI-to-MCP converters (openapi-mcp-generator at 495 stars, emcee at 320 stars, AWS Labs OpenAPI MCP, Swagger-MCP at 146 stars) dynamically generate MCP tools from OpenAPI/Swagger specs, letting AI agents call any REST API without manual tool definitions. GraphQL has official vendor support from Apollo (275 stars, Rust, 1,576 commits) and a strong community server (mcp-graphql at 374 stars). gRPC gets Redpanda's protoc-gen-go-mcp (190 stars), a compiler plugin that auto-generates Go MCP servers from .proto files. API testing has Postman's official MCP server (192 stars, 100+ tools). The strongest pattern is spec-to-server: give the MCP server an API spec, get tools for every endpoint."

**At a glance:** API development MCP servers are dominated by a single powerful pattern: **convert an API specification into MCP tools**. OpenAPI-to-MCP converters — [openapi-mcp-generator](https://github.com/harsha-iiiv/openapi-mcp-generator) (495 stars), [emcee](https://github.com/loopwork/emcee) (320 stars), [AWS Labs OpenAPI MCP](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp) (part of 8.5k-star monorepo), [Swagger-MCP](https://github.com/Vizioz/Swagger-MCP) (146 stars) — dynamically generate MCP tools from OpenAPI/Swagger specs, letting AI agents call any REST API without manual tool definitions. GraphQL has official vendor support from [Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server) (275 stars, Rust, 1,576 commits) and a strong community server ([mcp-graphql](https://github.com/blurrah/mcp-graphql), 374 stars). gRPC gets Redpanda's [protoc-gen-go-mcp](https://github.com/redpanda-data/protoc-gen-go-mcp) (190 stars), a compiler plugin that auto-generates Go MCP servers from .proto files. This is the **fourteenth review in our [Developer Tools MCP category](/categories/developer-tools/)**.

The API management market is projected at $6.89–10B in 2025, growing to $19.28B by 2030. REST dominates (~83% of web services), but GraphQL adoption has exploded — 50%+ of enterprises now use it in production (up from 10% in 2021), with 340% growth among Fortune 500 companies (2023–2025). gRPC is the de facto standard for internal microservices at Netflix, Uber, and Google. The MCP ecosystem reflects this multi-protocol reality: unlike most Developer Tools categories where one protocol dominates, API development MCP servers must bridge REST, GraphQL, and gRPC — and the spec-to-server pattern is the unifying approach.

**Architecture note:** API development MCP servers follow four patterns. **Spec-to-server converters** (openapi-mcp-generator, emcee, AWS Labs, Swagger-MCP, swagger-mcp) transform OpenAPI/Swagger specifications into MCP tools automatically — the dominant pattern. **Protocol bridges** (Apollo MCP, mcp-graphql, protoc-gen-go-mcp) provide native access to GraphQL and gRPC APIs through MCP. **API testing platforms** (Postman MCP, mcp-insomnia) expose collection management, request execution, and test reporting. **API mocking servers** (MockLoop, WireMock MCP, MSW MCP) generate mock endpoints from specs for development and testing.

## What's Available

### openapi-mcp-generator — Dynamic MCP from Any OpenAPI Spec (Most Starred)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Repository | [harsha-iiiv/openapi-mcp-generator](https://github.com/harsha-iiiv/openapi-mcp-generator) |
| Stars | ~495 |
| Forks | ~72 |
| Language | TypeScript |
| License | Not specified |
| Transport | stdio, SSE, Streamable HTTP |

**Key capabilities:**

| Capability | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| OpenAPI 3.0+ conversion | Automatically generates MCP tools from any OpenAPI specification |
| API proxying | Proxies requests to the original REST API, maintaining authentication |
| Zod validation | Runtime validation of requests using schemas derived from OpenAPI definitions |
| Auth support | API key, Bearer token, Basic auth, OAuth2 |
| TypeScript output | Typed tool definitions for type-safe interactions |

**Key differentiator:** The **most-starred dedicated OpenAPI-to-MCP converter**. Give it any OpenAPI 3.0+ spec and it dynamically generates MCP tools for every endpoint, handling authentication, validation, and proxying automatically. This is the purest expression of the spec-to-server pattern: one configuration step turns any documented REST API into an AI-accessible tool surface. Triple transport support (stdio, SSE, Streamable HTTP) makes it deployable in any MCP architecture.

**Limitation:** Dynamically generated tools can produce large tool lists for complex APIs (hundreds of endpoints), which consumes LLM context window. No filtering or grouping mechanism to expose only relevant endpoints. License not specified on GitHub, which may concern enterprise adoption. Quality of generated tools depends entirely on the quality of the underlying OpenAPI spec — poorly documented APIs produce poor MCP tools.

### emcee — Go-Based OpenAPI Converter with 1Password Integration

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Repository | [loopwork/emcee](https://github.com/loopwork/emcee) |
| Stars | ~320 |
| Forks | ~24 |
| Language | Go (89.3%) |
| License | MIT |
| Releases | 21 releases, v0.7.0 (October 2025) |

**Key capabilities:**

| Capability | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| OpenAPI conversion | MCP server for any app with an OpenAPI specification |
| Secret management | Bearer token, Basic auth, and 1Password integration |
| Spec transformation | Unix-utility based spec transformation pipeline |
| Installation | Docker and Homebrew support |
| Transport | stdio (JSON-RPC 2.0) |

**Key differentiator:** The **most mature and well-maintained OpenAPI-to-MCP converter**, with 21 releases and 88 commits indicating active development. The 1Password integration is unique — API credentials can be pulled from 1Password vaults rather than stored in plaintext configuration files. The Go implementation and Unix-utility spec transformation pipeline give it a composable, developer-friendly architecture. MIT license removes enterprise adoption barriers.

**Limitation:** Tools only — no MCP resources or prompts support yet. stdio transport only limits remote deployment options. Spec transformation via Unix utilities is powerful but adds a learning curve. v0.7.0 suggests pre-1.0 stability expectations. Fewer stars than openapi-mcp-generator despite more releases, suggesting less visibility.

### AWS Labs OpenAPI MCP Server

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Repository | [awslabs/mcp](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp) (monorepo) |
| Monorepo stars | ~8,500 |
| Monorepo forks | ~1,400 |
| Language | Python |
| License | Apache-2.0 |

**Key capabilities:**

| Capability | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Dynamic tool generation | Automatically creates MCP tools from API endpoints |
| Intelligent routing | Maps GET endpoints with parameters to appropriate MCP tools |
| Auth support | Basic, Bearer, API Key, Cognito authentication |
| Observability | Built-in metrics collection, caching, and resilience patterns |
| Validation | OpenAPI spec validation of requests and responses |

**Key differentiator:** Part of the **AWS Labs MCP monorepo** (8,500 stars), which gives it the backing of a major cloud provider. The intelligent route mapping automatically determines which API endpoints should become MCP tools and how parameters should be structured. Cognito authentication integration is unique to this server — AWS-native teams can use their existing IAM infrastructure. Built-in metrics and observability reflect enterprise-grade design.

**Limitation:** Python-only implementation. Part of a monorepo, so star count is shared across all AWS MCP servers (CDK, CloudFormation, Terraform, etc.) — individual adoption is unclear. AWS-centric auth (Cognito) may not suit non-AWS teams. Inherits the general spec-to-server limitation: tool count scales with API surface area.

### Apollo MCP Server — Official GraphQL (Most Active Development)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Repository | [apollographql/apollo-mcp-server](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server) |
| Stars | ~275 |
| Forks | ~66 |
| Language | Rust (98.8%) |
| License | MIT / Elastic License 2.0 |
| Commits | 1,576 |
| Releases | 61 (v1.10.0, March 19, 2026) |

**Key capabilities:**

| Capability | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| GraphQL operations | Exposes GraphQL operations as MCP tools |
| REST via Connectors | REST API integration through Apollo Connectors |
| CJK/emoji support | International schema support (v1.10.0) |
| Dynamic tools | Tool list depends on user's GraphQL operations |
| MCP Inspector | Compatible with the official MCP Inspector |

**Key differentiator:** The **most actively developed MCP server in the API development category** — 1,576 commits, 61 releases, v1.10.0 as of March 2026. Apollo is the dominant GraphQL platform, and their official MCP server reflects serious investment. The Rust implementation prioritizes performance. REST API integration via Apollo Connectors means this server isn't GraphQL-only — it can bridge REST APIs through the GraphQL layer. The high release cadence (61 versions) indicates rapid iteration and responsiveness to the MCP specification evolution.

**Limitation:** Dual-licensed (MIT and Elastic License 2.0) — the Elastic License restricts providing the software as a managed service. Requires Apollo platform knowledge. Dynamic tool generation depends on pre-defined GraphQL operations, meaning the server exposes what you've already built, not arbitrary GraphQL capabilities. 275 stars is modest compared to Apollo's broader platform adoption.

### mcp-graphql — Community GraphQL Server (Most Starred GraphQL)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Repository | [blurrah/mcp-graphql](https://github.com/blurrah/mcp-graphql) |
| Stars | ~374 |
| Forks | ~59 |
| Language | TypeScript (96%) |
| License | MIT |
| Version | v2.0.4 (May 2025) |

**Key capabilities:**

| Capability | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Schema discovery | Dynamic introspection or local/remote schema files |
| Query execution | Execute GraphQL queries against any endpoint |
| Mutation control | Mutations disabled by default for safety |
| Custom headers | Configurable headers for auth and API management |
| Tools | 2 core tools: introspect-schema, query-graphql |

**Key differentiator:** The **most-starred GraphQL MCP server** at 374 stars, surpassing Apollo's official server. The mutations-disabled-by-default design is notable — it prevents AI agents from accidentally modifying data through GraphQL mutations until explicitly enabled. The simplicity (2 core tools) keeps it focused: discover a schema, then query it. Works with any GraphQL endpoint, not just Apollo-managed ones.

**Limitation:** Only 2 tools — introspection and querying. No mutation support by default (safe but limiting for write operations). Last commit May 2025, suggesting maintenance-mode development. No type-safe query building or validation — the AI agent constructs raw GraphQL queries, which may produce invalid syntax. No subscription support.

### Postman MCP Server — Official API Testing Platform

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Repository | [postmanlabs/postman-mcp-server](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-mcp-server) |
| Stars | ~192 |
| Forks | ~62 |
| Language | TypeScript |
| License | Not specified |
| Transport | HTTP (streamable), stdio |

**Key capabilities:**

| Capability | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Tool count | 100+ in Full mode |
| Configuration modes | Minimal (default), Full, Code |
| Collection management | Create, run, and manage API test collections |
| Workspace management | Access workspaces, environments, variables |
| Code generation | Client code generation from API definitions |
| Spec creation | Automatic API specification creation |

**Key differentiator:** The **largest tool surface of any API development MCP server** — 100+ tools in Full mode. Postman is the dominant API development platform (30M+ users), and their official MCP server exposes the full platform capability: collections, environments, workspaces, code generation, and test execution. Three configuration modes (Minimal, Full, Code) let teams control the tool surface exposed to AI agents. The Code configuration enables AI-driven client SDK generation from API specs.

**Limitation:** 100+ tools in Full mode may overwhelm LLM context windows. Requires Postman account and API key. Last commit January 2025 — a 14-month gap raises maintenance concerns. License not specified. Postman's business model (free tier with paid team features) means some MCP tools may require paid plans. Platform-dependent — collections and workspaces live in Postman's cloud.

### protoc-gen-go-mcp (Redpanda) — gRPC Protocol Buffer Plugin

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Repository | [redpanda-data/protoc-gen-go-mcp](https://github.com/redpanda-data/protoc-gen-go-mcp) |
| Stars | ~190 |
| Forks | ~29 |
| Language | Go |
| License | Apache-2.0 |
| Creator | Redpanda Data (official) |

**Key capabilities:**

| Capability | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Protobuf compiler plugin | Generates Go MCP server code from .proto files |
| JSON schema generation | Auto-generates JSON schemas for tool parameters |
| Dual provider support | MCP + OpenAI function calling schemas |
| Library agnostic | Supports official go-sdk and mcp-go libraries |
| Tool namespacing | Prevents collisions across multiple .proto files |
| buf.validate support | Integration with Buf validation rules |

**Key differentiator:** The **only production-grade gRPC-to-MCP bridge**. As a protoc compiler plugin, it fits naturally into existing gRPC build pipelines — run `protoc` with the plugin and you get a Go MCP server alongside your regular gRPC stubs. Dual schema generation (MCP + OpenAI) means the same .proto files can power both MCP tools and OpenAI function calls. Backed by Redpanda, a well-funded data streaming company, indicating sustained investment.

**Limitation:** Go-only output — no TypeScript, Python, Java, or Rust MCP server generation from .proto files. Requires understanding of the protobuf compilation pipeline. 190 stars suggests adoption is limited to teams already using both gRPC and MCP. No support for gRPC streaming in MCP tools (MCP's request-response model doesn't map to gRPC streams).

### OpenAPI Converters — The Long Tail

**[Swagger-MCP (Vizioz)](https://github.com/Vizioz/Swagger-MCP)** (146 stars, TypeScript, MIT) — 5 tools including code generation: getSwaggerDefinition, listEndpoints, listEndpointModels, generateModelCode, generateEndpointToolCode. Converts Swagger/OpenAPI to MCP server definitions with semantic tool naming and MCP prompts for guided workflows. Downloads and caches specs locally.

**[openapi-mcp (ckanthony)](https://github.com/ckanthony/openapi-mcp)** (178 stars, Go, January 2026) — Secure API key management (hidden from MCP client), selective endpoint exposure via include/exclude filters, custom header injection. Docker deployment. Unique security feature: API keys are never exposed to the AI agent.

**[swagger-mcp (danishjsheikh)](https://github.com/danishjsheikh/swagger-mcp)** (81 stars, Go, MIT) — Dynamic tool generation from swagger.json at runtime, anti-hallucination focus (strict data retrieval from actual API responses). stdio and SSE transports.

**[swagger-mcp (amrsa1)](https://github.com/amrsa1/swagger-mcp)** (8 stars, JavaScript, MIT) — Auto-detection of IDE configs, intelligent token refresh on 401 responses, schema validation. 5 tools including execute_api_request.

### GraphQL — Additional Servers

**[mcp-graphql-schema (hannesj)](https://github.com/hannesj/mcp-graphql-schema)** (44 stars, JavaScript, MIT) — 10 tools for browsing query/mutation/subscription root fields, type definitions, pattern-based schema search. Auto-filters internal system types. More granular schema exploration than mcp-graphql.

**[mcp-graphql-forge (toolprint)](https://github.com/toolprint/mcp-graphql-forge)** (17 stars, TypeScript, Apache 2.0) — Auto-generates 63 tools from a sample schema (30 queries, 33 mutations). Multi-layer validation, smart field selection with circular reference handling, schema caching (~5ms tool generation), 40+ test cases. stdio and Streamable HTTP.

### gRPC — Additional Servers

**[grpcmcp (adiom-data)](https://github.com/adiom-data/grpcmcp)** (27 stars, Go, Apache 2.0) — Proxy to gRPC backend via descriptor files or reflection, bearer token auth, service filtering. SSE and stdin transports.

**[grpcurl-mcp (wricardo)](https://github.com/wricardo/grpcurl-mcp)** (16 stars, Go) — 3 tools (invoke, list, describe) wrapping grpcurl for gRPC method invocation and service discovery.

### API Testing — Additional Servers

**[mcp-postman (shannonlal)](https://github.com/shannonlal/mcp-postman)** (84 stars, TypeScript, ISC) — Execute Postman collections via Newman CLI. 1 focused tool with comprehensive test reporting (pass/fail/timing). Simpler alternative to the official server.

**[mcp-insomnia (anggasct)](https://github.com/anggasct/mcp-insomnia)** (14 stars, TypeScript, MIT, March 2026) — 30+ tools for Insomnia API client. Collection/folder management, request CRUD and execution, import from cURL/Postman/OpenAPI/Insomnia formats, code snippet generation, environment variable support. Actively maintained.

**[bruno-mcp (macarthy)](https://github.com/macarthy/bruno-mcp)** (10 stars, TypeScript, MIT) — 6 tools for the Bruno API client: create_collection, create_environment, create_request, create_crud_requests, add_test_script, get_collection_stats.

### API Mocking

**[MockLoop MCP](https://github.com/MockLoop/mockloop-mcp)** (15 stars, Python) — 30 tools (16 testing + 10 context + 4 core). Generates mock servers from OpenAPI specs, 3 modes (Mock/Proxy/Hybrid), enterprise audit logging, load/security/performance testing. The most full-featured mocking MCP server.

**WireMock MCP** — Built into WireMock CLI (WireMock itself has 6k+ stars). Codebase-aware API simulation, create/update mock endpoints via AI agents. Not a standalone repo.

**[MSW MCP (JasonBoy)](https://github.com/JasonBoy/msw-mcp)** (2 stars, TypeScript, MIT, February 2026) — AI-powered Mock Service Worker handler generation from natural language, real-time handler updates without page reload. WebSocket bridge transport.

### API Gateway / Management

**[Kong MCP Konnect](https://github.com/Kong/mcp-konnect)** (40 stars, TypeScript, Apache 2.0) — **DEPRECATED** (archived). Users directed to official Konnect remote MCP server. Kong AI Gateway 3.12+ now provides MCP autogeneration from any RESTful API, centralized OAuth, LLM-as-a-Judge policy validation, MCP traffic governance.

**Google Apigee MCP** — Part of [GoogleCloudPlatform/apigee-samples](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/apigee-samples). Discovers API specs from Apigee API hub, dynamically creates tools for LLMs, deploys to Cloud Run. Apigee now supports fully-managed remote MCP servers.

**MuleSoft MCP Server** (Salesforce/MuleSoft managed) — 47 tools across 9 categories including Agent Network Development, Application Development, Connector Development, DataWeave Development, and Application Management. Not a public GitHub repo.

### API Documentation

**Redocly MCP Server** — Built into Redocly Realm platform. Auto-generates MCP server from documentation + OpenAPI descriptions, supports the x-mcp OpenAPI extension for documenting MCP servers. Not a standalone repo.

### Notable Gaps

**No HTTPie MCP server** — HTTPie (a popular developer-friendly HTTP client) has no MCP integration. Also missing: Hoppscotch (feature request open, issue #5966), RapidAPI, Stoplight, ReadMe.

**No AsyncAPI MCP server** — Event-driven API specifications (Kafka, WebSocket, MQTT) have no MCP tooling. Only request-response APIs (REST, GraphQL, gRPC) are covered.

**No dedicated Swagger UI or API documentation generation server** — OpenAPI converters focus on tool generation, not documentation rendering or generation.

**No Mockoon MCP server** — Despite Mockoon's 6k+ GitHub stars as an API mocking tool, no MCP integration exists. Also missing: JSON Server, Karate, SoapUI, Dredd.

**No standalone API gateway MCP servers** — Kong archived theirs; Apigee and MuleSoft are platform-embedded. Tyk and AWS API Gateway have no dedicated MCP servers.

## Known Issues

1. **Spec-to-server conversion produces tool explosion** — An API with 200 endpoints generates 200 MCP tools. LLMs have finite context windows and tool selection degrades as tool count increases. OpenAPI converters like openapi-mcp-generator have no built-in filtering, grouping, or pagination mechanism. Postman's Full mode exposes 100+ tools. Only openapi-mcp (ckanthony) offers include/exclude filters — a feature that should be standard.

2. **OpenAPI spec quality determines MCP tool quality** — Every OpenAPI-to-MCP converter inherits the quality (or lack thereof) of the source specification. Missing descriptions, incomplete schemas, undocumented error codes, and absent examples all produce MCP tools that the AI agent struggles to use correctly. There's no validation or enrichment step — garbage in, garbage out.

3. **GraphQL mutations present safety risks** — mcp-graphql wisely disables mutations by default, but Apollo MCP exposes whatever operations are defined. An AI agent with mutation access can create, update, or delete data through GraphQL. There's no cross-server standard for read-only mode, confirmation prompts, or mutation safeguards. The risk scales with the API's destructive capabilities.

4. **gRPC streaming has no MCP equivalent** — MCP's request-response model doesn't map to gRPC's four streaming modes (unary, server-streaming, client-streaming, bidirectional). protoc-gen-go-mcp generates tools for unary RPCs only. Server streaming, which powers many real-time gRPC services, is inaccessible through MCP. This is a protocol-level limitation, not a tooling gap.

5. **API gateway MCP servers are disappearing, not growing** — Kong archived its MCP server, directing users to a managed remote endpoint. Apigee and MuleSoft embed MCP into their platforms. The trend is away from open-source, community-deployable API gateway MCP servers and toward vendor-hosted, platform-locked endpoints. Self-hosted teams lose out.

6. **API mocking MCP servers have near-zero adoption** — MockLoop (15 stars), MSW MCP (2 stars), mock-mcp (5 stars). Despite API mocking being a critical development workflow (Mockoon has 6k+ stars, WireMock has 6k+), MCP mocking servers haven't gained traction. The gap is significant: AI agents should be able to set up mock backends for frontend development and testing.

7. **No AsyncAPI or event-driven API support** — Every API development MCP server targets request-response protocols (REST, GraphQL, gRPC). Event-driven APIs (Kafka, WebSocket, MQTT, AMQP) — documented by AsyncAPI — have zero MCP coverage. As event-driven architectures grow, this gap widens.

8. **Authentication handling varies wildly** — openapi-mcp-generator supports API key/Bearer/Basic/OAuth2. emcee integrates with 1Password. openapi-mcp (ckanthony) hides API keys from the MCP client. AWS Labs uses Cognito. There's no standard for how MCP servers should handle API authentication. Some expose credentials to the AI agent; others keep them server-side. The security implications are significant — 53% of MCP servers rely on insecure long-lived static secrets, and only 8.5% use OAuth.

9. **Postman's official server may be abandoned** — Last commit January 2025 (14+ months ago). For the dominant API development platform (30M+ users), this gap is concerning. The community alternative (mcp-postman, 84 stars) exists but offers only Newman collection execution. Insomnia v12 added native MCP client support, potentially leapfrogging Postman in AI integration.

10. **No API design or specification authoring tools** — MCP servers can convert existing OpenAPI specs to tools, but none helps create or edit API specifications. No server assists with API design decisions (REST vs. GraphQL vs. gRPC), naming conventions, versioning strategies, or schema design. The creative/design phase of API development has zero MCP coverage.

## Bottom Line

**Rating: 3.5 out of 5**

API development MCP servers are built on a **powerful core pattern** — spec-to-server conversion — that solves a real problem elegantly: give an AI agent access to any documented API without writing custom MCP tools. OpenAPI-to-MCP converters (openapi-mcp-generator at 495 stars, emcee at 320 stars with 1Password integration, AWS Labs with enterprise observability, openapi-mcp at 178 stars with credential hiding) form a mature ecosystem for REST APIs. GraphQL has genuine vendor investment — Apollo's official MCP server (275 stars, 1,576 commits, 61 releases) is one of the most actively developed MCP servers in any category, and mcp-graphql (374 stars) provides a vendor-neutral alternative. gRPC gets thoughtful tooling from Redpanda's protoc-gen-go-mcp (190 stars), which fits naturally into existing protobuf build pipelines.

The **3.5/5 rating** reflects: a genuinely useful and well-executed core pattern (spec-to-server conversion), multi-protocol coverage (REST, GraphQL, gRPC — rare among Developer Tools categories), active vendor investment (Apollo 1,576 commits, Postman 100+ tools, Redpanda protoc plugin, AWS Labs), and practical utility (any OpenAPI-documented API becomes AI-accessible with minimal configuration). It loses 1.5 points for tool explosion problems (no filtering standard for large APIs), near-zero adoption of API mocking MCP servers, Postman's potentially abandoned official server (14+ month gap), no event-driven/AsyncAPI support, missing API design tooling, disappearing API gateway servers (Kong archived, others platform-locked), and the wild inconsistency in authentication handling across servers.

**Who benefits from API development MCP servers today:**

- **Teams with OpenAPI-documented APIs** — The spec-to-server converters are production-ready. Give your AI agent access to your internal APIs by pointing a converter at your OpenAPI spec. emcee's 1Password integration and openapi-mcp's credential hiding provide secure options
- **GraphQL teams** — Apollo's official server or mcp-graphql provide solid AI access to GraphQL APIs. mcp-graphql's mutations-disabled-by-default is the safer starting point
- **gRPC teams using Go** — Redpanda's protoc-gen-go-mcp integrates into existing build pipelines. If you already use protobuf, adding MCP tool generation is a protoc flag away
- **API testers using Postman** — Despite the maintenance gap, Postman's 100+ tools cover collection management, environment handling, and test execution

**Who should wait:**

- **Event-driven API teams** — Kafka, WebSocket, MQTT, and AsyncAPI have zero MCP coverage
- **API designers** — No MCP server assists with creating API specifications, design patterns, or versioning strategies
- **Teams needing API mocking** — MCP mocking servers have near-zero adoption. Use Mockoon or WireMock directly instead
- **Self-hosted API gateway teams** — Kong archived its open-source server; remaining options are platform-locked to vendor clouds
