**At a glance:** [GitHub](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-mcp) — 38 stars, 30 forks, 107 commits, TypeScript. Official first-party from [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). npm package: `@netlify/mcp` (v1.15.1). AI agents go from prompt to live site. Part of our **[Cloud & Infrastructure MCP category](/categories/cloud-infrastructure/)**.

The Netlify MCP Server is the **official first-party MCP integration** for [Netlify's](https://www.netlify.com/) web development platform. It bridges AI coding agents directly to Netlify's API and CLI, enabling developers to create projects, deploy applications, manage infrastructure, and iterate — all through natural language prompts without leaving their editor.

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) was founded in 2014 by **Mathias Biilmann** (CEO) and **Christian Bach** (Chief Strategy and Creative Officer). The company has raised **$212M** in total funding across four rounds (Series A through D), with the 2021 Series D of $105M led by Bessemer Venture Partners valuing the company at **$2 billion**. Other investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, and EQT Ventures. As of 2026: ~180-200 employees, ~$52M annual revenue. Trusted by LG Electronics, NBCUniversal, Riot Games, and Unilever.

**Architecture note:** Unlike MCP servers that merely expose API endpoints, Netlify's MCP server wraps both the **Netlify API and CLI**, giving agents the full deployment lifecycle — from project creation through build and deploy to live URL — within a single conversation.

## What It Does

The server enables agents to manage the complete Netlify workflow:

### Project & Site Management

| Capability | What It Does |
|------------|-------------|
| Create projects | Set up new Netlify sites from scratch |
| Deploy applications | Build and deploy to production or preview URLs |
| Manage settings | Configure project settings, domains, and redirects |
| Delete sites | Remove sites when no longer needed |

### Security & Configuration

| Capability | What It Does |
|------------|-------------|
| Access controls | Modify access controls to prevent unauthorized project access |
| Environment variables | Create and manage environment variables for projects |
| Secrets management | Handle project secrets securely |

### Extensions & Integrations

| Capability | What It Does |
|------------|-------------|
| Install extensions | Add Netlify extensions (e.g., Auth0, Supabase) with preconfigured defaults |
| Uninstall extensions | Remove extensions from projects |

### Team & Account Operations

| Capability | What It Does |
|------------|-------------|
| User information | Fetch details about the authenticated Netlify user |
| Team information | Retrieve team membership and account details |
| Form submissions | Enable and manage form submissions on projects |

The key selling point is **prompt-to-production**: agents can generate code, deploy it, get a live URL, check deploy logs for errors, fix issues, and redeploy — all within the same conversation. This closes the gap where most AI coding tools stop at code generation and leave deployment as a manual step.

## Setup & Configuration

### Requirements

- **Node.js 22+** (recommended)
- A **Netlify account** (free tier available)
- An **MCP-compatible client** (see supported clients below)
- **Netlify CLI** (optional but recommended — `npm install -g netlify-cli`)

### Installation

Add to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "netlify": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@netlify/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

For Claude Code: `claude mcp add netlify npx -- -y @netlify/mcp`

### Authentication

| Method | Details |
|--------|---------|
| CLI-based (default) | Uses existing Netlify CLI authentication via `netlify login` — preferred method |
| Personal Access Token | Set `NETLIFY_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable — temporary workaround for auth issues |

The CLI-based auth is the recommended approach. Run `netlify status` to verify authentication, or `netlify login` to authenticate. The PAT method is documented as a **temporary workaround** for environments where CLI-based auth has issues.

### Supported AI Clients

- **Windsurf** — Available in plugin store
- **Cursor** — One-click install via deeplink
- **VS Code / VS Code Insiders** — One-click install
- **Claude Code** — Via CLI command
- **Claude Desktop** — Via MCP directory
- **Goose** — Via MCP extension system
- **Sourcegraph Amp** — Via configuration file
- **Cline, Warp, LM Studio** — Via standard MCP config

## Development History

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Jun 2025 | Netlify launches official MCP Server (press release, San Francisco) |
| Jun-Dec 2025 | Active development — 107 commits, regular npm releases |
| Sep 2025 | Netlify introduces credit-based pricing (affects platform costs for MCP-triggered actions) |
| Mar 2026 | Latest release: @netlify/mcp v1.15.1 |

Sean Roberts (Distinguished Engineer, Netlify): *"Unlike other platforms retrofitting their MCP support, Netlify's was built from the ground up with real developers and real agents already powering production deployments."*

The repository shows healthy development activity with **107 commits** and **30 forks** — significantly more active than many enterprise MCP servers we've reviewed. The npm package has seen regular releases through v1.15.1.

## Pricing

The MCP server itself is **free and open-source**. Standard Netlify platform pricing applies to actions your agent performs (deploys, bandwidth, compute, etc.):

| Plan | Monthly Cost | Credits Included | Key Features |
|------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Free | $0 | 300 credits | Unlimited deploy previews, custom domains with SSL, functions, global CDN |
| Personal | $9/month | 1,000 credits | Smart secret detection, 1-day observability, priority email support |
| Pro | $20/member/month | 3,000 credits/team | Private repos, shared env vars, 3+ concurrent builds, 30-day analytics |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom | 99.99% SLA, enterprise network tier, SSO/SCIM, log drains, 24/7 support |

**Credit usage rates:** Production deploys cost 15 credits each, bandwidth is 10 credits/GB, compute is 5 credits per GB-hour, web requests are 3 credits per 10K.

**Note:** Netlify transitioned to credit-based pricing in September 2025. Accounts created before that date retain legacy pricing.

## Alternatives Comparison

| Feature | Netlify MCP (Official) | DynamicEndpoints/Netlify-MCP-Server | MCERQUA/netlify-mcp | Vercel MCP |
|---------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|------------|
| Maintainer | Netlify | Community | Community | Vercel |
| Stars | 38 | 6 | 0 | Varies |
| Commits | 107 | 24 | 9 | Varies |
| Tools | Full API + CLI access | 43 tools (Blobs, Dev Server, Recipes, Analytics) | 4 tools (create, list, get, delete) | Vercel platform |
| Auth | CLI login or PAT | PAT only | PAT only | Vercel tokens |
| Transport | stdio (npx) | stdio | stdio | stdio |
| Node.js | 22+ | 18+ | 18+ | Varies |

**Key differentiator:** The official server wraps both the Netlify API **and CLI**, giving agents capabilities that community alternatives can't match — including the full deploy pipeline, extension management, and CLI-based authentication. DynamicEndpoints offers more granular tools (43 vs. the official server's higher-level capabilities), while MCERQUA is a minimal 4-tool implementation.

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Authentication friction** — Users report issues staying logged in. The CLI-based auth (default) sometimes fails in MCP environments, requiring fallback to the PAT workaround. PAT values shouldn't be committed to repos, adding configuration complexity.

2. **Node.js 22+ requirement** — Requires Node.js 22 or higher, which is newer than what many developers have installed. Other MCP servers typically require Node 18+.

3. **No remote/hosted server option** — The server runs locally via npx only (stdio transport). Unlike PayPal or Square MCP servers that offer hosted remote endpoints, Netlify's MCP server requires local execution.

4. **Limited feature coverage** — Some Netlify features are not yet exposed: DNS management, forms API (beyond enable/disable), plugins, hooks, and deploy-level operations have limited or no support through the MCP server.

5. **Browser-dependent features** — Commands requiring browser interaction (like OAuth flows) may have limited functionality in headless MCP environments.

6. **No real-time streaming** — While deploy logs can be retrieved, the output is captured and returned rather than streamed in real-time. This can make debugging long builds less interactive.

7. **Site context requirements** — Some operations depend on the working directory being linked to a Netlify site. If the MCP server's working directory context doesn't match, these commands may fail silently or with unhelpful errors.

8. **Platform costs accumulate** — While the MCP server is free, every production deploy (15 credits), GB of bandwidth (10 credits), and compute hour (5 credits) counts against your plan. AI agents that iterate rapidly could consume credits quickly on the free tier's 300-credit limit.

## The Bottom Line

The Netlify MCP Server solves a real problem in AI-assisted development: **closing the gap between code generation and deployment**. Most AI coding tools stop at writing files — Netlify's MCP server lets agents go from prompt to live URL, check deploy logs, fix errors, and redeploy, all within the same conversation. This "prompt to production" workflow is genuinely useful.

The development activity is encouraging — **107 commits** and regular npm releases through v1.15.1 show this isn't a proof-of-concept that was shipped and forgotten. The breadth of supported clients (Windsurf, Cursor, VS Code, Claude, Goose, Sourcegraph Amp, and more) reflects Netlify's investment in making this work across the agent ecosystem.

However, the **authentication friction** is a real pain point — CLI-based auth failing in MCP environments and requiring PAT workarounds adds friction to what should be a seamless setup. The **Node.js 22+ requirement** is unnecessarily restrictive for many developer environments. And the **limited feature coverage** (no DNS, limited forms, no hooks/plugins) means agents can deploy but can't manage the full Netlify configuration.

**Rating: 4 / 5** — Official first-party from a well-funded ($212M, $2B valuation) web development platform, with genuinely useful prompt-to-production workflow that closes the code-generation-to-deployment gap. Active development (107 commits, v1.15.1), broad client support (7+ editors/agents), and healthy community engagement (38 stars, 30 forks) show commitment. Loses points for authentication friction, Node.js 22+ requirement, limited feature coverage beyond deploy workflows, and no remote server option. If Netlify smooths out the auth experience and broadens feature coverage, this could reach a 4.5.
