card_description: "Automotive and vehicle MCP servers for AI-powered vehicle diagnostics, Tesla control, EV charging, VIN decoding, and fleet telematics. **Tesla has the most MCP server implementations of any car brand** — at least 3 independent servers exist. cobanov/teslamate-mcp (120 stars, Python) is the most popular, providing 18 predefined analytical queries covering battery health, efficiency trends, charging patterns, and driving statistics from your TeslaMate PostgreSQL database, plus custom SQL with safety validation. scald/tesla-mcp (11 stars, TypeScript) connects directly to the Tesla Fleet API via OAuth 2.0 for real-time vehicle control — wake vehicles, check battery level, get status. keithah/tessie-mcp offers 39+ tools through the Tessie API including efficiency trend analysis, smart charging cost optimization, experimental FSD detection, and monthly summary reports. **Vehicle diagnostics get hardware-level MCP integration** — castlebbs/Vehicle-Diagnostic-Assistant runs an MCP server directly on a W600 microcontroller connected to an OBD-II WiFi dongle. The embedded server provides ELM327 command execution, OBD-II PID queries, DTC reading, and device health monitoring. The full system includes a Gradio UI, LangGraph agent orchestration, and NHTSA VIN decoder integration. farzadnadiri/MCP-CAN (MIT) takes a software-first approach — it simulates ECUs on a virtual CAN bus, decodes frames via DBC files, and exposes MCP tools over SSE. No hardware required. Commands include frame capture, signal monitoring, and OBD-II request simulation. **EV charging has dedicated MCP servers** — Abiorh001/mcp_ev_assistant_server combines OpenCharge Map API and Google Maps API for charging station discovery and EV trip planning. cevatkerim/chargenow-mcp connects to the ChargeNow network for real-time charging point availability. emporiaenergy/emporia-mcp is an official manufacturer server (in beta) providing EV charging session reports, energy monitoring, device listing, and power measurement data with automatic token refresh. **Vehicle data and VIN decoding are well-covered** — carsxe/carsxe-mcp-server (12 stars, MIT, TypeScript) is a comprehensive vehicle data server offering VIN decoding, vehicle specs, history reports, recall information, market value estimates, OBD code lookup, and license plate recognition via OCR. keptlive/vin-mcp provides VIN structure decoding with both HTTP web server and stdio modes. The NHTSA vPIC database is also available as an MCP endpoint via Apify. **Car marketplace search exists** — SiddarthaKoppaka/car_deals_search_mcp aggregates listings from Cars.com, Autotrader, and Kelley Blue Book using parallel Puppeteer scrapers, extracting price, mileage, and dealer info with optional CARFAX-style filters (1-owner, no accidents, personal use). **Connected vehicle and fleet telematics are emerging** — emqx/sdv-mcp-demo demonstrates MCP over MQTT for software-defined vehicle data analysis, processing driving behavior data at the edge and generating reports via LLMs. gperezt222/flespi-mcp-server provides 157 tools for the Flespi telematics platform — fleet management, device tracking, and telemetry processing with full MCP v1.0 compliance. **Maps and navigation servers are automotive-adjacent** — mapbox/mcp-server (official) provides routing with driving, walking, and cycling profiles supporting 2-25 waypoints. cablate/mcp-google-map offers 13 tools including directions, distance matrix, and route planning. tomtom-international/tomtom-mcp (official) provides routing, search, and live traffic data. baidu-maps/mcp (official) supports driving, walking, cycling, and transit route planning. These aren't automotive-specific but are essential for vehicle-related AI workflows. **The dealership angle is emerging** — AutoUnify launched ServiceMCP for AI-powered automotive service scheduling, and Fullpath has written about MCP adoption in automotive retail, but these are commercial products rather than open-source MCP servers. **Major gaps persist** — no BMW ConnectedDrive, Mercedes me, Hyundai Bluelink, Ford FordPass, or other brand-specific MCP servers despite existing APIs. No ADAS or autonomous driving simulation integration (CARLA, Autoware). No insurance or claims processing. No tire or parts inventory management. No repair shop or service bay management. No parking finder or reservation. No car wash booking. No ride-sharing or taxi dispatch. No traffic violation or toll management. No vehicle inspection scheduling. The automotive space is still early-stage for MCP adoption compared to categories like developer tools or databases. The category earns 3/5 — automotive MCP is genuinely nascent but shows real promise. Tesla owners are the best served thanks to three independent servers covering analytics, control, and cost optimization. The Vehicle-Diagnostic-Assistant project is genuinely innovative — running an MCP server on embedded hardware connected to a car's OBD-II port. CAN bus simulation via MCP-CAN is excellent for development. EV charging has functional servers. Vehicle data via CarsXE is comprehensive. But the category lacks depth compared to mature MCP verticals — most subcategories have only 1-2 servers, major car brands are absent, and the industry-specific tooling (dealership management, insurance, fleet operations) is largely missing. As connected car APIs mature and the automotive industry embraces AI integration, this category should grow significantly."

Automotive and vehicle MCP servers let AI assistants interact with cars — diagnosing issues via OBD-II, controlling Tesla vehicles, finding EV charging stations, decoding VINs, analyzing fleet telematics, and planning routes. Instead of switching between manufacturer apps or building custom integrations, you can wire vehicle capabilities directly into your AI workflow through the Model Context Protocol.

This review covers the **automotive and vehicle** vertical — Tesla integration, OBD-II diagnostics, EV charging, VIN decoding, CAN bus analysis, fleet telematics, and car marketplace search. For maps and navigation (which overlap with automotive), see our [Maps & Geolocation review](/reviews/maps-geolocation-mcp-servers/). For IoT and hardware integration, see our [IoT & Smart Home review](/reviews/iot-smart-home-mcp-servers/).

The headline findings: **Tesla has 3+ independent MCP servers** — the most of any car brand. **OBD-II diagnostics run on actual embedded hardware** via MCP. **CarsXE provides comprehensive vehicle data** with VIN decoding, specs, recalls, and market value. **Flespi offers 157 fleet telematics tools**. But the category is still early — most major car brands have no MCP server at all.

## What's Missing

The automotive MCP space has significant gaps:

- **Major car brands** — no BMW ConnectedDrive, Mercedes me, Hyundai Bluelink, Ford FordPass, Toyota, Honda, GM OnStar, or Volkswagen MCP servers despite all having connected car APIs
- **Autonomous driving** — no CARLA simulator, Autoware, or ADAS integration
- **Insurance & claims** — no vehicle insurance quoting or claims processing
- **Parts & inventory** — no tire, parts, or aftermarket inventory management
- **Repair shop management** — no service bay scheduling, work order management, or labor tracking
- **Parking** — no parking finder, reservation, or payment integration
- **Ride-sharing** — no Uber/Lyft-style dispatch or ride management
- **Traffic & tolls** — no traffic violation management or toll payment integration
- **Vehicle inspection** — no emissions testing or safety inspection scheduling
- **Dealership operations** — AutoUnify's ServiceMCP exists commercially but not as open-source

## The Bottom Line

**Rating: 3/5** — Automotive MCP is genuinely nascent but shows real promise. Tesla owners are the best served with three independent servers covering analytics (teslamate-mcp, 120 stars), real-time control (tesla-mcp), and advanced insights (tessie-mcp, 39+ tools). The Vehicle-Diagnostic-Assistant is genuinely innovative — running an MCP server on embedded hardware connected to a car's OBD-II port. CAN bus simulation via MCP-CAN is excellent for development. Vehicle data via CarsXE is comprehensive. Fleet telematics via Flespi provides 157 tools.

But the category lacks depth compared to mature MCP verticals. Most subcategories have only 1-2 servers. Major car brands are completely absent. Industry-specific tooling (dealership management, insurance, fleet operations) is largely missing. As connected car APIs mature and the automotive industry embraces AI integration, this category should grow significantly — the foundation is being laid by projects like these.
