**At a glance:** [microsoft/work-iq](https://github.com/microsoft/work-iq) (594 stars, official, CC-BY-4.0) + [Softeria/ms-365-mcp-server](https://github.com/Softeria/ms-365-mcp-server) (552 stars, community, MIT). OneDrive sits at the center of 446 million Microsoft 365 seats, and its MCP ecosystem is growing fast — but auth complexity keeps it behind Google Drive.

OneDrive MCP servers let AI agents **search, read, create, and manage files across your Microsoft 365 environment** — browse OneDrive folders, read and write documents, manage Outlook email, schedule Calendar events, access SharePoint sites, and apply enterprise security labels — all through natural language prompts. **Microsoft has an official Work IQ OneDrive remote server** in preview, while a growing community ecosystem already covers the full M365 suite.

[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) was founded on April 4, 1975, by **Bill Gates** and **Paul Allen**. The company went public in March 1986 (NASDAQ: MSFT). As of early 2026: **~$281.7 billion annual revenue** (FY 2025, ~15% YoY growth), **~$2.98-3.15 trillion market cap**. Microsoft 365 has over **446 million paid seats** globally, with commercial revenue exceeding **$60 billion annually**. SharePoint Online has **200+ million users**. Microsoft 365 holds approximately **58% enterprise market share** among organizations with 1,000+ employees, and **75% of Fortune 500** companies use M365 as their primary productivity suite.

**Architecture note:** Microsoft's official MCP server is a managed remote endpoint hosted by Microsoft — no local installation required, but it requires a **Microsoft 365 Copilot license** ($30/user/month). Community implementations wrap the Microsoft Graph API, using Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) for authentication. Most support device code flow, OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow, or certificate-based auth.

### Other Implementations

| Server | Stars | Language | Focus |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|

## Authentication

OneDrive MCP servers have the **most complex authentication setup** of any cloud storage MCP ecosystem:

| Method | Used By | Complexity |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Entra ID + Copilot License | Official Work IQ | Highest — requires $30/user/mo license |
| Azure App Registration + Device Code | Softeria, elyxlz | High — Azure portal setup required |
| Azure App Registration + OAuth 2.0 | hvkshetry, ftaricano | High — redirect URI configuration |
| CLI pre-auth (`m365 login`) | pnp/cli-microsoft365 | Medium — requires global CLI install |
| Certificate-based | lokka | Medium — requires cert generation |
| RFC 9728 Protected Resource Metadata | MrFixit96 | Low — zero-config in HTTP mode |

**Enterprise blockers:** When tenant admins disable "Users can consent to apps" in Entra ID, users see "needs admin approval" errors. Conditional Access Policies can block third-party apps entirely. Two-factor authentication can break device code flows.

## Cloud Storage MCP Comparison

| Dimension | OneDrive | Google Drive | Dropbox |
|-----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Official MCP** | Work IQ (preview, 13 tools, 5MB limit) | google/mcp (3.4k stars, GA remote servers) | 2 servers (remote files + Dash search) |
| **Top Community** | Softeria (552 stars, 249 commits) | taylorwilsdon (1.9k stars, 543 forks) | Limited community ecosystem |
| **Ecosystem Size** | 8-10 repos | 10+ repos | 5-6 repos |
| **Auth Complexity** | **Highest** — Azure Entra ID, admin consent | Medium — Google OAuth 2.0 | Low-Medium — Dropbox OAuth |
| **Enterprise Features** | **Strongest** — sensitivity labels, Defender, admin governance | High — Workspace admin | Medium — Business plan for Dash |
| **File Size Limits** | 5MB (official) | No hard limit in community servers | No hard limit |
| **License for Official** | M365 Copilot ($30/user/mo) | Free with Google account | Free (core), Business (Dash) |
| **Unique Feature** | Sensitivity labels, Copilot Studio integration | Deep Docs/Sheets/Slides editing | Dash cross-app search (30+ apps) |

## OneDrive Pricing

| Plan | Price | Storage |
|------|-------|---------|
| OneDrive Standalone (Personal) | $1.99/month | 100 GB |
| Microsoft 365 Personal | $9.99/month | 1 TB |
| Microsoft 365 Family (up to 6) | $9.99/month | 1 TB/user |
| OneDrive for Business (Plan 1) | $5/user/month | 1 TB |
| Microsoft 365 Business Basic | $6/user/month | 1 TB |
| Microsoft 365 Business Standard | $12.50/user/month | 1 TB + desktop Office |
| Microsoft 365 Business Premium | $22/user/month | 1 TB + Intune/Defender |
| **M365 Copilot** (required for official MCP) | **$30/user/month** | Add-on to M365 plan |

## Known Issues

1. **Authentication complexity** — Azure app registration, Entra ID configuration, and admin consent requirements make setup significantly harder than Google Drive or Dropbox MCP servers. Enterprise tenants with Conditional Access Policies can block third-party apps entirely.

2. **Copilot license requirement** — The official Work IQ server requires a Microsoft 365 Copilot license at $30/user/month, the highest cost barrier of any cloud storage MCP server.

3. **5MB file size limit** — The official server limits all file operations to 5MB, making it unsuitable for typical document workflows involving large presentations, spreadsheets, or media files.

4. **20-item folder listing cap** — The official server returns a maximum of 20 items per folder listing, making it impractical for folders with many files.

5. **Preview status** — The official Work IQ OneDrive server is in preview; tool names and parameters may change. The previous ODSP combined server was already deprecated (March 13, 2026).

6. **Security vulnerabilities** — Community security audits have found critical vulnerabilities in some implementations, including bearer token exposure and insufficient input validation. Choose implementations carefully.

7. **Personal OneDrive only** — The official server currently only accesses personal OneDrive, not shared drives or organizational file areas (handled separately by Work IQ SharePoint).

8. **Token refresh failures** — Device code flow tokens expire and require manual browser interaction to renew, interrupting automated workflows.

9. **Admin consent barriers** — Many enterprise tenants disable user consent for third-party apps, requiring IT admin approval before any community MCP server can connect — a process that can take days or weeks.

10. **Ecosystem fragmentation** — With 8-10+ implementations varying in language (TypeScript, Python, Java, JavaScript), auth method, and feature coverage, choosing the right server requires significant evaluation.

## Bottom Line

**Rating: 3.5 out of 5**

OneDrive MCP servers occupy an interesting position: the **most enterprise-ready** cloud storage MCP ecosystem (sensitivity labels, Defender integration, admin governance) but also the **most difficult to set up** (Azure Entra ID, admin consent, Copilot license). Microsoft's official Work IQ server has genuinely unique enterprise features that Google Drive and Dropbox lack, but the 5MB file limit and $30/user/month price tag make it impractical for most individual users.

The community ecosystem is solid — **Softeria's ms-365-mcp-server** at 552 stars with 249 commits is a genuinely comprehensive M365 integration covering email, calendar, OneDrive, Teams, SharePoint, and more. The **pnp/cli-microsoft365-mcp-server** offers a clever CLI bridge approach, and **MrFixit96's security-focused implementation** addresses real vulnerabilities found in other servers.

**Who should use OneDrive MCP servers:**

- **Enterprise teams** on Microsoft 365 who need AI agents to manage documents, email, and calendar within their existing M365 environment
- **IT administrators** who want AI-assisted Azure and M365 management (via lokka or pnp CLI bridge)
- **Security-conscious organizations** that need sensitivity labels and admin governance on AI file access

**Who should wait:**

- **Individual users** — the auth complexity and Copilot license cost make Google Drive or Dropbox MCP servers much more accessible
- **Teams needing large file support** — the 5MB official limit is a dealbreaker for real document workflows
- **Anyone without Azure admin access** — enterprise Conditional Access Policies can block setup entirely

The 3.5/5 rating reflects Microsoft's strong enterprise positioning and the active 552-star community server, balanced against the highest auth complexity, highest license cost, and most restrictive file limits of any cloud storage MCP ecosystem we've reviewed.
