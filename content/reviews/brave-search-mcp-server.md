Every agent needs search. You can reason about code all day, but eventually you need to look something up — check an API, find documentation, verify a fact. The Brave Search MCP server is the most complete search integration available for MCP, and it's maintained by Brave themselves.

I've researched it thoroughly. Here's what I've found.

**At a glance:** 811 GitHub stars · 140+ forks · v2.0.75 · 510+ commits · ~6.3K weekly npm downloads (@brave package, ~24K for legacy @modelcontextprotocol package) · ~6.9K weekly PulseMCP visitors (#83 globally, ~385K all-time) · TypeScript · MIT license

## What It Does

The Brave Search MCP server connects AI agents to Brave's search API through six tools:
- **brave_web_search** — General web search. Up to 20 results per query, with filters for country, language, freshness, and safe search. Also generates summary keys for AI summarization.
- **brave_local_search** — Local business search with ratings, hours, AI-generated descriptions, and addresses. Requires a paid plan; gracefully falls back to web search on the free credit tier.
- **brave_image_search** — Image search. Up to 200 results with metadata. Returns URLs only (no base64 since v2.x — keeps context lean).
- **brave_video_search** — Video search with thumbnails and metadata.
- **brave_news_search** — News search with freshness controls and extra snippets.
- **brave_summarizer** — AI-powered summaries from web search results, with source references. Paid plan feature using a two-step workflow (web search → summarize).

This is more tooling than any other search MCP server offers. Most competitors give you web search and nothing else.

## What's New (March 2026 Update)

The biggest news since our last review isn't about the MCP server itself — it's about the API behind it.

- **Free tier eliminated (February 12, 2026).** Brave discontinued the free Search API tier that gave 2,000 queries/month (later 5,000 under the August 2025 "AI Grounding" update). All plans now use metered billing. You get $5 in monthly credits (~1,000 queries at $5/1,000 requests) — but only if you attribute the Brave Search API on your project's website. Previous free tier had no attribution requirement. Credit cards are now collected at signup as active billing instruments, not just identity verification.

- **New plan structure.** Four paid plans replace the old Free/Pro tiers:
  - **Search** — $5 per 1,000 requests. Includes web, images, news, videos, and the new LLM Context search.
  - **Answers** — $4 per 1,000 web searches + $5 per million tokens. Returns grounded responses with citations (94.1% F1-score on SimpleQA benchmark).
  - **Spellcheck** — $5 per 10,000 requests.
  - **Autocomplete** — $5 per 10,000 requests.

- **New LLM Context API.** Instead of returning URLs like traditional search, this delivers "smart chunks" — pre-extracted, relevance-ranked text optimized for LLM consumption. Extracts clean text, structured data, code context, forum discussions, and video captions. Sub-600ms latency at p90. Supports token budgets for cost control. This is arguably the most significant Brave API addition for agent workflows.

- **Brave is now the only independent Western search index.** Microsoft discontinued the Bing Search API in summer 2025. Google blocks most AI use cases. This gives Brave a unique market position — if you want a non-Google, non-scraping search API, Brave is essentially the only option.

- **MCP server itself: minimal changes.** v2.0.75 is current. No major feature additions to the MCP server layer since the v2.x release. The LLM Context API and Answers API are available through the Brave API but don't yet have dedicated MCP tools — you'd need to use `brave_web_search` with summary keys, or a community fork like mikechao/brave-search-mcp that adds LLM Context search support.

- **Community alternatives growing.** Notable forks and reimplementations: mikechao/brave-search-mcp (adds LLM Context search), dedalus-labs/brave-search-mcp (Streamable HTTP), Shoofio/brave-search-mcp-sse (SSE interface), arben-adm/brave-mcp-search (Python). The official server remains the most polished, but the community is filling gaps.

## Setup

**Step 1: Get a Brave Search API key.** Sign up at brave.com/search/api/. You'll need a credit card. Every plan includes $5 in monthly credits (with attribution requirement) — enough for ~1,000 web searches.

**Step 2: Add to your MCP client config.** For Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "brave-search": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@brave/brave-search-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "BRAVE_API_KEY": "your-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

That's it. Two steps. Compare this to the GitHub MCP server's token-scoping dance and Docker dependency — Brave's setup is refreshingly simple. STDIO is the default transport since v2.x, so you don't need to specify it.

**Setup difficulty: Easy.** You need Node.js 22+ and an API key. Multiple install paths:
- **Smithery:** `npx -y @smithery/cli install brave` (one-click)
- **NPX:** `npx -y @brave/brave-search-mcp-server` (no install needed)
- **Docker:** `docker run -i --rm -e BRAVE_API_KEY mcp/brave-search` (multi-arch: amd64/aarch64)
- **MCP Registry:** `io.github.brave/brave-search-mcp-server`
- **VS Code:** One-click via MCP extension
- **AWS Marketplace:** Enterprise ECR integration

**Configuration uses a three-tier precedence system:** CLI arguments > environment variables > defaults. Key options:

| Parameter | Env Variable | CLI Flag | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| API Key | `BRAVE_API_KEY` | `--brave-api-key` | Required |
| Transport | `BRAVE_MCP_TRANSPORT` | `--transport` | stdio |
| HTTP Port | `BRAVE_MCP_PORT` | `--port` | 8000 |
| Log Level | `BRAVE_MCP_LOG_LEVEL` | `--logging-level` | info |
| Enable tools | `BRAVE_MCP_ENABLED_TOOLS` | `--enabled-tools` | All |
| Disable tools | `BRAVE_MCP_DISABLED_TOOLS` | `--disabled-tools` | None |
| HTTP Host | `BRAVE_MCP_HOST` | `--host` | 0.0.0.0 |

The CLI argument support is a v2.x addition — you're no longer limited to environment variables for configuration.

## What's New (v2.x Updates)

If you used the v1.x server, here's what changed:

- **STDIO is now the default transport.** v1.x defaulted to HTTP. If you need HTTP (e.g., for AWS Bedrock AgentCore), set `--transport http` explicitly.
- **Image search returns URLs only.** v1.x returned base64-encoded image data alongside URLs, which bloated context windows. v2.x strips the base64 and returns response objects closer to the raw Brave API format.
- **Client-side rate limiting.** The server now enforces 50 requests/second and 15,000 requests/month client-side, preventing you from accidentally burning through your API quota. This is a significant improvement over v1.x, which had no rate management at all.
- **AWS Bedrock AgentCore support.** A stateless HTTP mode enables compatibility with AWS's managed agent infrastructure.
- **CLI argument support.** Every configuration option can now be set via command-line flags, not just environment variables. This makes one-off testing and debugging much easier.
- **Docker Hub and MCP Registry.** Official multi-architecture Docker images (`mcp/brave-search`) and MCP Registry listing for easier discovery.

## What Works Well

**The tool breadth is genuinely useful.** Web search handles 90% of agent needs, but the other tools fill real gaps. News search is great for "what happened with X this week" queries. Image search helps when an agent needs to verify visual content or find reference images. The summarizer saves context window space by distilling search results into key points.

**Brave's independent index is now uniquely important.** With Bing's API discontinued (summer 2025) and Google blocking most AI use cases, Brave operates the only independent Western search index accessible to AI agents. This isn't just a differentiator anymore — it's a monopoly position. Brave's 30+ billion page index is the only non-Google, non-scraping option for programmatic search.

**Privacy as a feature.** If you're building agents that handle sensitive queries — research on competitors, internal planning, etc. — Brave's no-tracking stance means your queries aren't feeding someone else's ad model. This matters more than most people think.

**Tool filtering is well-designed.** Being able to enable/disable specific tools via environment variables or CLI flags means you can create focused search agents. A research agent gets all six tools. A fact-checking agent gets just web search and summarizer. Principle of least privilege, applied correctly.

**Client-side rate limiting prevents quota disasters.** The built-in enforcement of 50 req/sec and 15,000 req/month means your agent won't accidentally burn through your API allocation in a tight loop. Especially important now that every query costs money.

**The new LLM Context API is a game-changer (at the API level).** Smart chunks pre-extracted for LLM consumption, with sub-600ms latency and token budgets, is exactly what agent workflows need. The catch: the official MCP server doesn't expose it as a dedicated tool yet.

## What Doesn't Work Well

**The free tier is dead.** This was previously one of Brave's biggest selling points. The February 2026 pricing change replaced 2,000-5,000 free monthly queries with $5 in credits (~1,000 queries) that require attribution on your project's website. You also need a credit card at signup — no more zero-commitment experimentation. Community forums report billing issues (double subscriptions, inability to cancel cards, unresponsive support). For hobbyists and small projects, this changes the calculus significantly.

**Search quality trails Google for niche queries.** Brave's index is impressive for an independent engine, but for obscure technical queries — specific error messages, rare library documentation, niche academic topics — Google still returns better results. For mainstream queries, the difference is negligible. Know your use case.

**The MCP server lags behind the API.** Brave's LLM Context API and Answers API are significant additions, but the official MCP server hasn't added dedicated tools for them. You're stuck with the original six tools. Community forks like mikechao/brave-search-mcp have added LLM Context support, but the official server hasn't caught up.

**Node.js 22 requirement is steep.** Many developers are still on Node 18 or 20 (both LTS). Requiring 22+ means either upgrading your system Node or managing versions with nvm. Docker sidesteps this entirely, but it's still friction for the npx path.

**Proxy support is incomplete.** The server doesn't respect standard `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables. If you're behind a corporate proxy, you'll need workarounds.

**No spending cap disclosed.** The new metered billing has no documented spending cap. With agents that can run autonomously, this is a real risk. The client-side rate limiter (15,000 req/month) provides some protection, but if you're running multiple agents or have modified the limits, costs can accumulate without warning.

## Compared to Alternatives

**vs. Google (via SerpAPI/Tavily):** Google still has better search quality overall, but SerpAPI costs more ($50/mo for 5,000 searches) and you're adding a middleman. Brave is cheaper at $5/1,000 queries and has a unique independent index. With Bing gone, your options for non-Google search are increasingly limited.

**vs. Exa:** Exa does neural/semantic search optimized for AI — better for "find me papers about X" style research. But it's a specialized tool at a higher price point. Brave is the general-purpose workhorse; Exa is the research specialist. Exa still offers 1,000 free requests/month — more generous than Brave's current $5 credit.

**vs. Perplexity:** Perplexity provides answer-focused results with citations — more like asking a question than running a search. Different mental model, different use case. Brave gives you raw search results; Perplexity gives you synthesized answers. Brave's new Answers API competes more directly with Perplexity now, but it's not yet exposed in the MCP server.

**vs. Tavily:** Tavily offers a true free tier (1,000 API credits/month, no credit card). For hobbyists priced out by Brave's metered billing, Tavily is now the more accessible entry point for keyword search MCP integration.

## Who Should Use This

**Yes, use it if:**
- You need a general-purpose search tool for your AI agent
- You want multiple search types (web, news, images, video) in one server
- You care about privacy and don't want queries tracked
- You want the only independent Western search index (post-Bing discontinuation)
- You're building agents that research topics, verify facts, or find documentation
- You need AWS Bedrock AgentCore compatibility
- You're okay with metered billing at $5/1,000 queries

**Skip it if:**
- You need the absolute best search quality on niche/obscure topics (use a Google wrapper)
- You primarily need semantic/neural search for research (use Exa)
- You want a truly free tier with no credit card (use Tavily or Exa free tiers)
- You're behind a corporate proxy with no workaround
- You need LLM Context search via MCP (use mikechao/brave-search-mcp until the official server adds it)

{{< verdict rating="4" summary="The default search server for most agents — but no longer free" >}}
The Brave Search MCP server remains the most feature-complete search integration in the MCP ecosystem. Six tools, privacy by default, and setup that takes two minutes. Brave's unique market position — the only independent Western search index after Bing's API discontinuation — makes it harder to replace than ever. The v2.x server is solid: client-side rate limiting, CLI configuration, Docker distribution, and AWS Bedrock support. But February 2026's pricing change stings: the generous free tier (2,000-5,000 queries/month) is gone, replaced by $5 monthly credits (~1,000 queries) with an attribution requirement. And the MCP server hasn't kept pace with the API — the new LLM Context and Answers APIs remain unexposed. Still the best general-purpose search MCP server, but hobbyists should look at Tavily or Exa's free tiers first.
