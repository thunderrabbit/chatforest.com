Part of our **[Databases MCP category](/categories/databases/)**.

**At a glance:** ~50,600 GitHub stars (main repo), 5,600 forks, v1.0.7 (Mar 20, 2026), 1,971 commits, 275 releases, 639 stars (MCP server repo), 138 forks, v0.2.1 (MCP server), 9 tools, Python, Apache-2.0, PulseMCP 116K all-time (#268 globally, ~2.7K weekly, #410 this week)

Mem0 is the most well-funded, most-starred memory layer in the AI ecosystem — 50,600+ GitHub stars, $23.9M in funding, and a platform used by 4,700+ repositories. Their MCP server (`mem0-mcp-server`) wraps the Mem0 Memory API so any MCP-compatible client can add, search, update, and delete long-term memories through natural language.

Unlike Anthropic's official Knowledge Graph Memory server (which stores everything in a local JSONL file), Mem0 is a managed cloud service with semantic search, automatic memory extraction, and optional graph memory. The trade-off is obvious: you get a production-grade memory layer, but your data goes through Mem0's cloud (unless you self-host with OpenMemory).

The MCP server has 639 stars and 138 forks on GitHub — a solid community adoption signal. There's also a separate community implementation by Cole Medin (`coleam00/mcp-mem0`, 663 stars, 235 forks) that's become a popular template for building Python MCP servers in general, though it hasn't been updated since January 2025.

## What It Does

The server exposes nine tools:

**Memory operations:**
- **`add_memory`** — Persist text or conversation history for a user or agent. Mem0 automatically extracts and indexes key information from the content.
- **`search_memories`** — Semantic search across stored memories with filtering and result limits. This is where Mem0 shines — it doesn't just do keyword matching, it understands meaning.
- **`get_memories`** — List memories with structured filters and pagination.
- **`get_memory`** — Retrieve a single memory by its ID.
- **`update_memory`** — Overwrite a memory's content.
- **`delete_memory`** — Remove an individual memory.
- **`delete_all_memories`** — Bulk delete all memories within a scope.

**Entity management:**
- **`delete_entities`** — Remove user, agent, app, or run entities and their associated data.
- **`list_entities`** — Enumerate stored entities across the system.

The key difference from simpler memory servers: Mem0 does intelligent extraction. When you save a conversation, it doesn't just dump the raw text — it identifies and stores the meaningful facts. "I prefer Python over JavaScript and I'm working on a healthcare startup" becomes structured memories that surface when contextually relevant.

## Setup

**Installation via pip or uv:**

```bash
uv pip install mem0-mcp-server
# or
pip install mem0-mcp-server
```

**Claude Desktop configuration:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mem0": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mem0-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "MEM0_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You need a Mem0 platform account (free tier available). Get your API key from the Mem0 dashboard.

**Environment variables:**
- `MEM0_API_KEY` — Required. Your Mem0 platform credentials.
- `MEM0_DEFAULT_USER_ID` — Optional. Defaults to "mem0-mcp".
- `MEM0_ENABLE_GRAPH_DEFAULT` — Optional. Enable graph memory (default: false).
- `MEM0_MCP_AGENT_MODEL` — Optional. Defaults to "openai:gpt-4o-mini".

**Docker deployment** is also available for HTTP transport on port 8081, and there's a **Smithery** option for managed remote hosting.

**Transport:** stdio (default via uvx) and HTTP (via Docker).

## The Two Mem0 MCP Options

This is where it gets interesting. Mem0 actually offers two distinct MCP servers:

### 1. mem0-mcp-server (Cloud)

The main MCP server reviewed here. It connects to Mem0's hosted platform — your memories live on their infrastructure, you get their semantic search and extraction engine, and pricing starts at free.

**Pricing tiers:**
- **Hobby (free):** 10,000 memories, 1,000 retrieval calls/month
- **Starter ($19/month):** 50,000 memories, 5,000 retrievals
- **Pro ($249/month):** Unlimited memories, 50,000 retrievals, graph memory, analytics
- **Enterprise (custom):** On-prem deployment, SSO, SLA

### 2. OpenMemory MCP (Local/Self-hosted)

A completely local, privacy-first alternative. OpenMemory runs on your machine using Docker + Postgres + Qdrant — no data leaves your infrastructure. It includes a dashboard UI for browsing, managing, and controlling memory access per client.

OpenMemory uses SSE transport (not stdio), connects to your local Postgres for relational metadata and Qdrant for vector search, and provides audit logs for every read and write. It's the right choice if you can't send data to a third-party cloud.

The trade-off: you need Docker and the infrastructure running locally, and you lose Mem0's managed extraction engine and graph memory features.

## What's New (March 2026 Update)

**Mem0 platform v1.0.7 shipped (March 20, 2026).** The underlying platform continues rapid iteration — three releases in three weeks. v1.0.7 adds Ollama tool support and response parsing, Apache AGE graph store integration, MiniMax LLM provider, and improved extraction quality with noise filtering and deduplication. v1.0.6 (March 17) brought per-agent memory isolation for multi-agent setups, v2 API migration for platform search, SQLite resilience for OSS mode, and LM Studio embedder/LLM support. v1.0.5 (March 3) added LLM fact output validation before embedding. The platform now has 275 releases total.

**Graph memory backends expanding.** Beyond Neo4j, Mem0 now supports Apache AGE (PostgreSQL-native graph), FalkorDB (per-user graph isolation), Memgraph, Amazon Neptune Analytics, and Kuzu. The graph-enhanced variant (Mem0ᵍ) pushes accuracy to 68.4% on the LOCOMO benchmark with 0.66s median search latency.

**OpenMemory now supports multiple LLM providers.** The local/self-hosted option has expanded beyond OpenAI to support Ollama (fully local, no API calls), Anthropic Claude, Groq, Together, and DeepSeek as extraction backends. This significantly reduces the "hidden OpenAI dependency" concern for the self-hosted path.

**Independent benchmarks paint a mixed picture.** On the LOCOMO benchmark (Long Conversation Memory evaluation), Mem0's self-reported score of ~66% doesn't fully hold up — independent testing measured ~58%, trailing Zep (~85%), Letta/MemGPT (~83.2%), and SuperLocalMemory (87.7%). Mem0's strengths lie more in managed infrastructure, multi-agent isolation, and enterprise features than raw retrieval accuracy.

**AWS enterprise integration.** Amazon published a reference architecture for Mem0 Open Source with ElastiCache for Valkey and Neptune Analytics, giving enterprises a cloud-native deployment path with graph memory on AWS infrastructure.

**MCP server itself is stable but quiet.** The `mem0-mcp-server` package remains at v0.2.1 (December 2025) with only 48 commits and 6 contributors. The action is in the main Mem0 platform — the MCP server is a thin wrapper that benefits from platform improvements without needing its own updates.

## What's Good

**Semantic search that works.** Mem0's retrieval is the real differentiator. It doesn't just match keywords — it understands that "my preferred programming language" should surface the memory about Python, even if those exact words weren't stored. The +26% accuracy claim over OpenAI Memory (from their own benchmarks) is plausible given the architecture, though independent benchmarks show more modest results (see "What's New" above).

**Automatic memory extraction.** Agents don't need to decide what to remember. Feed in a conversation and Mem0 pulls out the facts. v1.0.5+ adds fact validation before embedding, and v1.0.7 improves extraction quality with noise filtering and deduplication — addressing earlier complaints about irrelevant memories cluttering results.

**Multi-level memory organization.** Memories can be scoped to users, sessions, agents, or apps. v1.0.6 added per-agent memory isolation for multi-agent setups — each agent gets its own memory namespace, preventing cross-contamination in complex deployments.

**Graph memory option with expanding backends.** The Pro tier adds knowledge graph capabilities on top of vector search — relationships between entities, not just isolated facts. Graph backend support has expanded beyond Neo4j to include Apache AGE, FalkorDB, Memgraph, Neptune, and Kuzu, giving teams more flexibility in their infrastructure choices.

**Two deployment models.** Cloud for convenience, OpenMemory for privacy. OpenMemory now supports multiple LLM providers including Ollama for fully local operation — no API calls required.

## What's Not

**Cloud dependency for the main server.** The primary MCP server sends all your memories to Mem0's cloud. For personal use this might be fine, but for enterprise or sensitive data it's a non-starter without OpenMemory.

**Free tier limitations.** 10,000 memories and 1,000 retrievals per month sounds generous until an active agent starts saving memories from every conversation. At typical usage, you could burn through the free tier in a few weeks.

**Price jump to Pro.** The gap from Starter ($19/month) to Pro ($249/month) is steep. Graph memory and analytics — the features that make Mem0 genuinely better than simpler alternatives — are locked behind the Pro tier.

**OpenAI dependency (partially addressed).** The default agent model is still `openai:gpt-4o-mini`, meaning the cloud extraction pipeline uses OpenAI under the hood. OpenMemory now supports Ollama and other providers for fully local operation, but the cloud MCP server still routes through OpenAI by default.

**Independent benchmarks lag competitors.** While Mem0 claims 26% accuracy improvement over OpenAI Memory, independent LOCOMO benchmark testing places Mem0 at ~58% — significantly behind Zep (~85%), Letta (~83.2%), and local alternatives like SuperLocalMemory (87.7%). Mem0's value proposition is increasingly about managed infrastructure rather than retrieval accuracy.

**OpenMemory is a separate project.** Despite sharing the Mem0 brand, OpenMemory and the cloud MCP server are different codebases with different feature sets. OpenMemory doesn't get graph memory through the managed engine. This fragmentation can be confusing, though OpenMemory's expanded LLM provider support is closing some gaps.

## How It Compares

**vs. Anthropic's Memory MCP server:** Mem0 is a massive upgrade in capability — semantic search vs. full-graph dump, automatic extraction vs. manual entity creation, cloud scaling vs. local JSONL. But the Memory server is free, has zero dependencies, and keeps everything local. For simple personal use, Anthropic's server might actually be enough.

**vs. Chroma MCP server:** Chroma gives you raw vector database operations — you manage collections, embeddings, and queries yourself. Mem0 abstracts all of that away into a "just save and search" interface. Mem0 is better for agent memory; Chroma is better for building custom RAG pipelines.

**vs. Qdrant MCP server:** Similar distinction to Chroma — Qdrant is a vector database tool, Mem0 is a memory layer built on top of vector databases. Mem0 handles extraction and organization; Qdrant gives you direct control over the vector space.

**vs. Zep:** Zep is Mem0's closest competitor in the "managed AI memory" space. Zep stores memory as a temporal knowledge graph that tracks how facts change over time, while Mem0 focuses on managed extraction and cloud scaling. Independent benchmarks (LOCOMO) actually favor Zep on retrieval accuracy (~85% vs. ~58%), but Mem0 has far stronger community adoption (50.6K vs. ~2K stars) and a more mature enterprise story.

**vs. Letta/MemGPT:** Letta takes a fundamentally different approach — it's an agent runtime where memory management is part of a full operating-system-inspired platform. Letta scores ~83.2% on LOCOMO benchmarks, significantly ahead of Mem0 on accuracy. But Mem0 is easier to integrate as a drop-in memory layer for existing agents.

## The Bigger Picture

Mem0 represents where AI memory is heading: managed services that handle the hard parts (extraction, indexing, retrieval) so developers can focus on building agents. The MCP server makes this accessible to any MCP-compatible client with minimal setup.

The challenge is the business model. Free tiers get people started, but the jump to production-grade features (graph memory, serious retrieval volume) costs real money. For individual developers and small teams, this is fine — $19/month is reasonable. For enterprises, the on-prem Enterprise tier exists but the pricing isn't public.

The community ecosystem remains strong — 663 stars on Cole Medin's template implementation (though inactive since January 2025) and a growing ecosystem of third-party Mem0 MCP variants for project management, self-hosting with Neo4j, and specialized use cases. OpenMemory's expanded LLM provider support makes the local path more viable than ever.

Memory is still a mostly unsolved problem for AI agents. Most agents either remember nothing or remember too much. Mem0's approach — automatic extraction with semantic retrieval — is the most practical solution available today, and the MCP server makes it drop-in simple.

## Rating: 4/5

Mem0's MCP server earns a 4/5 for being the most complete managed AI memory solution available through MCP — nine tools, semantic search, automatic extraction, expanding graph memory backends, and both cloud and self-hosted deployment options. It loses a point for cloud dependency in the main server, the steep price jump to Pro for graph memory, underwhelming retrieval accuracy in independent benchmarks (trailing Zep and Letta on LOCOMO), and ongoing fragmentation between the cloud and OpenMemory codebases. But in a category where most alternatives are either too simple (Anthropic's JSONL graph) or too low-level (raw vector DB operations), Mem0 hits the right abstraction level for production agent memory — especially for teams that value managed infrastructure over raw benchmark scores.

**Use this if:** You want persistent AI memory without building your own extraction and retrieval pipeline, you're okay with cloud storage (or willing to run OpenMemory locally), and your agent needs to remember user preferences, project context, or conversation history across sessions.

**Skip this if:** You need everything fully local with zero cloud dependencies (OpenMemory helps but lacks graph memory), you're building custom RAG where you need direct vector DB control, or your budget can't handle the $249/month jump when you outgrow the free tier.
