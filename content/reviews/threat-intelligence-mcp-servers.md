card_description: "Threat intelligence is one of the strongest MCP categories in cybersecurity. Two major vendors — **Google** and **CrowdStrike** — have shipped official MCP servers, and the community has built mature integrations for every significant open-source CTI platform. **Google Threat Intelligence MCP** (450 stars, Python, Apache-2.0) is part of a broader mcp-security mono-repo that also wraps Chronicle SIEM, Security Command Center, and SOAR — giving security teams a unified AI interface across Google's entire security stack. **CrowdStrike Falcon MCP** (118 stars, Python, MIT) exposes 40+ tools across 16 modules covering detections, incidents, hosts, threat intelligence, IOC management, custom IOA rules, firewall policies, cloud security, vulnerability management, and more — essentially the entire Falcon platform accessible via natural language. On the community side, **BurtTheCoder's mcp-shodan** (116 stars) and **mcp-virustotal** (113 stars) are the go-to individual-source servers, while **frishtik's OSINT Tools MCP** (178 stars) bundles seven reconnaissance tools (Sherlock, Maigret, TheHarvester, SpiderFoot, GHunt, Holehe, Blackbird) for username, email, and domain OSINT. The open-source CTI platforms are well-represented: **OpenCTI** has three MCP integrations (the largest at 38 stars with 21 tools), **AlienVault OTX** has two (up to 19 tools), and **MISP** has a direct bridge. Multi-source aggregation servers like **FastMCP-ThreatIntel** (34 stars, combining VirusTotal + OTX + AbuseIPDB + IPinfo) and **Mallory CTI** (7 stars, 48 tools across CVEs, threat actors, malware, and ATT&CK) let analysts query across platforms in a single conversation. The category's strength: unlike many MCP domains where tools are wrappers around REST APIs with minimal adoption, threat intelligence MCP servers are being built by the vendors themselves and used in real SOC workflows."

Threat intelligence is where the MCP ecosystem meets real operational security. Unlike many categories where MCP servers are thin wrappers around existing APIs, the threat intelligence space has genuine vendor investment — Google and CrowdStrike both ship official MCP servers — and community servers that solve real analyst workflows: correlating IOCs across multiple feeds, enriching alerts with context, and hunting for adversary TTPs through natural language. Part of our **[Security & Compliance MCP category](/categories/security-compliance/)**.

This review covers MCP servers that **provide threat intelligence data and analysis** — IOC lookups, CTI platform integrations, OSINT tools, and threat hunting frameworks. For MCP servers that *secure* the MCP ecosystem itself (scanning for malicious servers, SBOMs, tool poisoning detection), see our [AI Agent Supply Chain Security review](/reviews/ai-agent-supply-chain-security-mcp-servers/). For network scanning and vulnerability assessment, see [Network Security MCP](/reviews/network-security-mcp-servers/). For incident response and forensics, see [Digital Forensics & Incident Response MCP](/reviews/digital-forensics-incident-response-mcp-servers/).

The headline: **Google and CrowdStrike lead with official, comprehensive servers.** The community has built strong integrations for VirusTotal, Shodan, OpenCTI, MISP, and AlienVault OTX. Multi-source aggregation servers are emerging as a practical pattern. This is one of the most mature and useful MCP categories we've reviewed.

## Official Vendor Servers

### Google Threat Intelligence (mcp-security)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [google/mcp-security](https://github.com/google/mcp-security) | ~450 stars |
| License | Apache-2.0 |
| Language | Python |
| Modules | GTI, Chronicle, SOAR, SCC, Remote MCP |

The most comprehensive official security MCP project. Google's mcp-security is a mono-repo containing five server modules, with the Google Threat Intelligence (GTI) server being the crown jewel for CTI analysts.

### What Works Well

**Full Google security stack.** GTI provides VirusTotal-powered threat intelligence (file/URL/domain/IP analysis, threat actor tracking, campaign intelligence). Chronicle wraps Google's SIEM for log search and alert investigation. Security Command Center covers cloud security posture. SOAR handles playbook execution. This isn't just a VirusTotal wrapper — it's an AI interface to Google's entire security operations platform.

**Multiple deployment methods.** uv, pip, Docker via Google ADK — flexible enough for local analyst workstations or production infrastructure. GCP Application Default Credentials handle auth cleanly.

**Active development.** 356 commits and growing, with regular additions of new tools and server modules.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**GCP dependency.** Chronicle, SCC, and SOAR modules require Google Cloud Platform accounts and appropriate IAM permissions. The GTI module works with a standalone VirusTotal API key, but the full value requires GCP investment.

**Complexity.** Five modules with different auth requirements, different deployment needs, and different GCP dependencies. Setting up the full stack is non-trivial compared to single-purpose community servers.

### CrowdStrike Falcon MCP

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [CrowdStrike/falcon-mcp](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/falcon-mcp) | ~118 stars |
| License | MIT |
| Language | Python |
| Tools | 40+ across 16 modules |

The most tool-rich threat intelligence MCP server we've seen. CrowdStrike exposes virtually the entire Falcon platform through MCP — detections, incidents, hosts, intelligence, IOC management, custom IOA rules, firewall policies, cloud security, vulnerability management (Spotlight), asset discovery (Discover), sensor management, scheduled reports, NGSIEM log queries, and identity protection.

### What Works Well

**Breadth is unmatched.** 40+ tools across 16 modules. An analyst can go from "show me today's critical detections" to "what hosts are affected?" to "what threat actor is behind this?" to "create an IOC block rule" — all in a single AI conversation. No other MCP server covers this much of an EDR/XDR platform.

**Modular architecture.** Selective module loading means you can expose only the modules relevant to a user's role. SOC analysts get detections and incidents; threat intel teams get the intelligence module; vulnerability teams get Spotlight. This is smart RBAC-adjacent design.

**Multiple deployment options.** Local Docker, AWS Bedrock, Google Cloud Run, Vertex AI — CrowdStrike clearly intends this for production SOC use, not just demos.

**FQL query support.** Falcon Query Language is exposed through MCP, letting analysts write precise filters rather than relying solely on natural language interpretation.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**Public preview status.** CrowdStrike labels this as "public preview" — not GA. API surface may change, and enterprise support isn't guaranteed.

**Falcon platform required.** Every module requires active CrowdStrike Falcon subscriptions. This is purely an interface to an existing deployment, not a standalone tool.

## Community IOC Lookup Servers

### mcp-virustotal

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [BurtTheCoder/mcp-virustotal](https://github.com/BurtTheCoder/mcp-virustotal) | ~113 stars |
| License | MIT |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Tools | 8 |

The community standard for VirusTotal MCP integration. Eight tools covering URL, file, IP, and domain reports plus relationship queries with pagination.

### What Works Well

**Relationship queries are the differentiator.** Beyond basic reports, you can traverse VirusTotal's relationship graph — "show me all files downloaded from this domain" or "what URLs communicate with this IP." Pagination support means large result sets are handled cleanly.

**Broad client support.** Tested with Claude Desktop, VS Code, Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI. HTTP streaming transport for modern deployments. Docker support for isolation.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**Free API tier limitations.** VirusTotal's free tier is rate-limited (4 requests/minute, 500/day). Heavy investigation workflows will hit these limits quickly. Premium API keys are expensive.

**TypeScript-only.** No Python alternative at comparable maturity (barvhaim's Python port has ~1 star; ThreatFlux's Rust version has ~2 stars).

### mcp-shodan

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [BurtTheCoder/mcp-shodan](https://github.com/BurtTheCoder/mcp-shodan) | ~116 stars |
| License | MIT |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Tools | 7 |

The community standard for Shodan. IP lookups, search queries, CVE lookups, DNS resolution, and CPE-based vulnerability queries.

### What Works Well

**CVE integration is practical.** The cve_lookup and cves_by_product tools go beyond Shodan's core network intelligence into vulnerability management territory. Combined with ip_lookup, an analyst can quickly answer "is this IP running vulnerable software?"

**Published to MCP Registry.** Listed in the official MCP server registry, which means better discoverability and some implicit vetting.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**Shodan API key costs.** Free Shodan accounts have very limited query access. Meaningful use requires a paid membership ($69/lifetime or $19/month for enterprise features). The search tool specifically requires a paid plan.

**No streaming API.** Shodan's Monitor and Streaming APIs (real-time alerts on network changes) aren't exposed — only the REST API for point-in-time lookups.

### OSINT Tools MCP Server

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [frishtik/osint-tools-mcp-server](https://github.com/frishtik/osint-tools-mcp-server) | ~178 stars |
| License | MIT |
| Language | Python |
| Tools | 7 (each wrapping a major OSINT tool) |

A meta-server that bundles seven OSINT reconnaissance tools behind a single MCP interface: Sherlock (399+ platforms), Holehe (120+ services), SpiderFoot, GHunt, Maigret (3,000+ sites), TheHarvester, and Blackbird (581 sites).

### What Works Well

**Enormous coverage.** Username enumeration across 3,000+ sites (Maigret), email breach checking on 120+ services (Holehe), Google account investigation (GHunt), domain reconnaissance (TheHarvester with DNS/WHOIS/email harvesting), and automated OSINT scanning (SpiderFoot). All accessible through natural language queries.

**Async parallel execution.** Tools run concurrently where possible, which matters when you're checking a username across thousands of platforms.

**Ethical compliance built in.** GDPR/CCPA compliance notices, rate limiting, and clear documentation on responsible use. Important for a tool category that can easily veer into misuse.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**Heavy dependencies.** Each wrapped tool has its own installation requirements, Python dependencies, and potential version conflicts. Auto-install helps but failures are common in constrained environments.

**Not true threat intelligence.** This is reconnaissance/OSINT — finding where accounts exist, harvesting emails, checking breaches. Valuable for investigations but distinct from IOC-based threat intelligence.

## CTI Platform Integrations

### OpenCTI MCP (Spathodea-Network)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [Spathodea-Network/opencti-mcp](https://github.com/Spathodea-Network/opencti-mcp) | ~38 stars |
| License | MIT |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Tools | 21 |

The most mature OpenCTI MCP integration. 21 tools covering reports, STIX object search, user management, system operations, file handling, and reference data — essentially a comprehensive interface to an OpenCTI instance.

**GraphQL query support** lets advanced analysts write precise queries. Customizable result limits prevent context window overflow on large datasets. Three alternative OpenCTI MCP servers exist: **jhuntinfosec/mcp-opencti** (26+ tools, Python, more search-focused), **ckane/pycti-mcp** (15 stars, 4 focused lookup tools, 69 commits — the most actively maintained), and a few others at earlier stages.

### MISP MCP Server

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [bornpresident/MISP-MCP-SERVER](https://github.com/bornpresident/MISP-MCP-SERVER) | ~10 stars |
| License | MIT |
| Language | Python |
| Tools | 6+ |

Bridges Claude to organizational [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/) (Malware Information Sharing Platform) deployments. Tools cover platform-specific malware detection (Mac/Windows/Linux/Android/iOS/IoT), attribute and tag search, threat actor lookup, TLP classification, IOC submission, report generation, and recent feed analysis.

**The value proposition:** MISP is the most widely deployed open-source threat intelligence platform, used by CERTs, ISACs, and SOCs worldwide. This MCP server lets analysts query their organization's private threat data through AI rather than the MISP web UI. Requires MISP API credentials and SSL certificate configuration.

### AlienVault OTX MCP (otx-mcp)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [mrwadams/otx-mcp](https://github.com/mrwadams/otx-mcp) | ~20 stars |
| License | MIT |
| Language | Python |
| Tools | 19 |

The most comprehensive AlienVault OTX integration. 19 tools covering indicator lookups (IP, domain, URL, file hash), pulse management (search, details, indicators), user operations (subscriptions, followers), and analysis tools.

**Docker deployment** via GitHub Container Registry makes setup straightforward. Pagination support handles OTX's large pulse datasets. A lighter alternative, **jalacloud/mcp-cti** (27 stars, 7 tools), focuses on pulse search and indicator checking with local response caching — better for quick lookups, while otx-mcp is better for deep OTX exploration.

## Multi-Source Aggregation

### FastMCP-ThreatIntel

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [4R9UN/fastmcp-threatintel](https://github.com/4R9UN/fastmcp-threatintel) | ~34 stars |
| License | Apache-2.0 |
| Language | Python |
| Sources | VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX, AbuseIPDB, IPinfo |

The best example of the "unified threat intel" pattern — combining multiple free-tier sources into a single MCP interface so analysts don't need to query each platform separately.

### What Works Well

**Automatic IOC detection.** Feed it an IP, domain, URL, or hash and it queries all configured sources simultaneously. No need to specify which platform to check — the server routes the query to all relevant sources.

**APT attribution and MITRE ATT&CK mapping.** Goes beyond raw IOC data to correlate findings with known threat actor profiles and ATT&CK techniques. Interactive HTML reports with D3.js visualizations provide shareable output.

**STIX-compliant exports.** Results can be exported in STIX format for ingestion into SIEM/SOAR platforms — bridging the gap between AI-driven analysis and traditional security tooling.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**Four sources only.** VirusTotal, OTX, AbuseIPDB, and IPinfo. Missing Shodan, GreyNoise, abuse.ch platforms, and many other common feeds. The unified approach is right but the coverage is limited.

**34 stars suggests limited adoption.** For a tool that aggregates free sources — which should have broad appeal — the adoption is surprisingly low. May indicate reliability or usability issues not apparent from the README.

### Mallory CTI MCP

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [malloryai/mallory-mcp-server](https://github.com/malloryai/mallory-mcp-server) | ~7 stars |
| License | Apache-2.0 |
| Language | Python |
| Tools | 48 |

A hosted threat intelligence platform with an MCP server interface. 48 tools covering vulnerabilities, threat actors, malware families, attack patterns, exploits, breaches, advisories, and "stories" (curated threat narratives).

**Trending intelligence** across 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day windows. Actively exploited vulnerability tracking. MITRE ATT&CK integration. The tool count (48) is impressive, though it requires the Mallory platform — this is a commercial product's MCP interface, not an open-source tool.

## Behavioral Threat Hunting

### Threat Hunting MCP Server

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [THORCollective/threat-hunting-mcp-server](https://github.com/THORCollective/threat-hunting-mcp-server) | ~10 stars |
| License | Not specified |
| Language | Python |
| Tools | 15+ |

The most conceptually interesting server in this review. While every other server here does IOC lookups ("is this IP malicious?"), the Threat Hunting MCP takes a **TTP-first behavioral approach** — helping analysts hunt for adversary behaviors rather than indicators.

### What Works Well

**Framework-driven hunting.** Supports PEAK, SQRRL, and TaHiTI threat hunting methodologies. Rather than ad-hoc querying, analysts follow structured hunting frameworks that ensure comprehensive coverage.

**HEARTH community hunts.** 50+ pre-built hunt packages from the HEARTH repository, giving analysts a library of proven hunt hypotheses to test against their environment.

**MITRE ATT&CK, Diamond Model, and Cyber Kill Chain mapping.** Every hunt is contextualized within standard threat frameworks, making findings actionable and reportable.

**Cognitive bias detection.** A unique feature — the server includes a module that flags potential analytical biases in threat hunting conclusions. Novel and genuinely useful for reducing false conclusions.

**Splunk integration.** Direct query execution against Splunk instances for running hunt queries against real log data.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**No license specified.** For a security tool, this is a significant concern — unclear terms for enterprise use.

**Splunk-only for data queries.** No integration with other SIEMs (Elastic, Chronicle, Sentinel). Limits the audience to Splunk shops.

**10 stars.** Despite being conceptually strong, adoption is minimal. May need more documentation and a clearer onboarding path.

## Also Covered

**Cyber Sentinel MCP** ([jx888-max/cyber-sentinel-mcp](https://github.com/jx888-max/cyber-sentinel-mcp), ~6 stars, Python) — 11 tools combining multi-source IOC analysis (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, URLhaus, Shodan, ThreatFox, MalwareBazaar) with code/container/Kubernetes security scanning. Async concurrent processing with 1-hour result caching and graceful degradation when sources are unavailable.

**mcp-threatintel (unified)** ([aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-threatintel](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-threatintel), ~1 star, TypeScript, MIT) — 18 tools combining AbuseIPDB, AlienVault OTX, GreyNoise, and abuse.ch platforms (URLhaus, MalwareBazaar, ThreatFox, Feodo Tracker). Works with partial API credentials and free-tier access for all sources. Feodo Tracker needs no API key at all.

**World Intelligence MCP** ([marc-shade/threat-intel-mcp](https://github.com/marc-shade/threat-intel-mcp), ~11 stars, Python, MIT) — 110 tools across 43+ public APIs spanning cyber threat intel, geopolitical analysis (ACLED, GDELT), financial intelligence (Yahoo Finance, FRED), health (WHO), environmental (NASA, NOAA), and more. Uses Qdrant vector store for semantic search. Ambitious scope but the cyber threat tools are a subset of the whole.

**abusech-mcp** ([lokallost/abusech-mcp](https://github.com/lokallost/abusech-mcp), ~2 stars, Python, MIT) — 4 tools providing a unified interface to abuse.ch platforms (MalwareBazaar, URLhaus, ThreatFox). These platforms normally lack a unified API, so this fills a genuine gap.

**virustotal-rs** ([ThreatFlux/virustotal-rs](https://github.com/ThreatFlux/virustotal-rs), ~2 stars, Rust, MIT) — 6 MCP tools wrapping VirusTotal API v3 in async Rust with rate limiting and dual transport. The only Rust-based threat intel MCP server.

**pycti-mcp** ([ckane/pycti-mcp](https://github.com/ckane/pycti-mcp), ~15 stars, Python, MIT) — 4 focused OpenCTI lookup tools. 69 commits makes this the most actively maintained OpenCTI MCP, though it has fewer tools than Spathodea-Network's 21-tool version.

## What's Missing

- **No Elastic Security MCP.** Given Elastic's role in SOCs, the absence of an official or mature community MCP server for Elastic SIEM/Security is a notable gap.
- **No Microsoft Sentinel MCP.** Microsoft's cloud SIEM has no MCP integration despite Microsoft's involvement with the MCP standard.
- **No STIX/TAXII MCP server.** No dedicated server for consuming TAXII feeds or querying STIX data stores — STIX export is available as a feature in some servers, but there's no server that acts as a TAXII client via MCP.
- **No threat intelligence sharing via MCP.** All servers are read-only consumers. None facilitate contributing indicators back to CTI platforms through MCP (MISP MCP has IOC submission, but it's the exception).
- **No real-time alerting.** Every server does point-in-time lookups. None provide streaming threat feeds or real-time notifications of new threat intelligence matching defined criteria.

## Rating: 4.0 / 5

Threat intelligence is one of the strongest MCP categories we've reviewed. The combination of official vendor servers (Google, CrowdStrike), mature community integrations (VirusTotal, Shodan, OpenCTI, MISP, OTX), and emerging patterns (multi-source aggregation, behavioral hunting) makes this genuinely useful for security practitioners today.

**Why 4.0 and not higher:** Despite the breadth, there's significant fragmentation. An analyst investigating a single IOC might need to configure 3-4 separate MCP servers (VirusTotal for file analysis, Shodan for infrastructure context, OTX for pulse correlation, their SIEM for internal data). The aggregation servers (FastMCP-ThreatIntel, mcp-threatintel) try to solve this but are immature. And the absence of Elastic, Sentinel, and real-time alerting MCP servers limits coverage of many real SOC environments. Still, this is a category where MCP is solving real problems for real analysts — not just wrapping APIs for the sake of it.
