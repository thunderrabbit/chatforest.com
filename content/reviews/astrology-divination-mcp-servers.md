card_description: "Astrology and divination MCP servers for AI-powered chart casting, card readings, and ancient oracle consultation — from calculating natal charts with Swiss Ephemeris precision to drawing tarot spreads with cryptographic shuffling. This is one of the most culturally diverse MCP categories we've reviewed. **BaZi dominates by stars** — cantian-ai/bazi-mcp (271 stars) is the highest-starred server in this space by a wide margin, calculating Chinese Four Pillars of Destiny with heavenly stems, earthly branches, Five Elements, Ten Gods, and major life phases. It's derived from a popular GPT Store app and represents the strongest bridge between traditional Chinese metaphysics and modern AI. **Western astrology has solid foundations** — simpolism/AstroMCP (14 stars) generates natal charts via Swiss Ephemeris, while dm0lz/swiss-ephemeris-mcp-server (7 stars, MIT) provides pure astronomical calculations for planetary positions, transits, synastry, and solar returns. The ephemeris.fyi server (8 stars, 11 tools) stands out as a free hosted remote MCP — no installation needed, just connect to the URL. **Tarot is surprisingly well-served** — fzlzjerry/tarot-mcp (7 stars, 8 tools) is the most feature-rich with 11 professional spreads, custom spread creation, elemental analysis, and cryptographically secure shuffling. abdul-hamid-achik/tarot-mcp (6 stars, MIT, 9 tools) and junebash/swift-tarot-mcp (6 stars, Swift, MIT) round out the options. **I Ching has a standout implementation** — threemachines/i-ching (10 stars, Rust, MIT) uses the authoritative Wilhelm-Baynes translation with all 64 hexagrams, judgments, images, and line interpretations. MCP-Liuyao (6 stars) adds Liu Yao six-line divination with true solar time calculation. **Vedic astrology connects to commercial APIs** — prokerala-mcp-server bridges to Prokerala's API for kundli matching and panchang, while astrovisor-mcp dynamically exposes 50+ endpoints from AstroVisor's platform covering Natal, BaZi, Transits, Jyotish, Numerology, and Human Design. **Two commercial platforms offer MCP access** — Astrology-API.io provides 16 tools with 23 house systems and Swiss Ephemeris precision from a free tier, while RoxyAPI covers 8 mystical domains (astrology, tarot, numerology, I Ching, crystals, dream interpretation, angel numbers) with 110+ total endpoints. **Gaps remain significant** — no standalone numerology MCP server, no rune divination, no feng shui calculator, and no palmistry or face reading tools. The category earns 3.5/5 — diverse traditions are represented with genuine calculation depth, but most servers are low-star individual projects and the commercial tier is where the real feature density lives."

Astrology and divination MCP servers let AI assistants cast natal charts, draw tarot cards, consult the I Ching, calculate BaZi pillars, and access planetary ephemeris data. Instead of manually entering birth details into astrology websites, shuffling physical tarot decks, or looking up hexagram interpretations, these servers let AI agents perform precise astronomical calculations, generate readings with proper randomization, and interpret results across multiple traditions — all through the Model Context Protocol.

This review covers the **astrology and divination** vertical — Western astrology (natal charts, transits, synastry), Chinese astrology (BaZi, lunar calendar), tarot, I Ching, horoscopes, ephemeris data, Human Design, and commercial platforms. For astronomy and space data, see our [Aerospace & Defense MCP review](/reviews/aerospace-defense-mcp-servers/).

The headline findings: **BaZi dominates by stars** with cantian-ai/bazi-mcp (271 stars) far ahead of everything else. **Western astrology has multiple calculation engines** built on Swiss Ephemeris. **Tarot has three solid implementations** with professional spreads and proper randomization. **I Ching has the most culturally faithful implementation** in Rust with Wilhelm-Baynes translations. **Two commercial platforms** (Astrology-API.io, RoxyAPI) offer the broadest feature coverage. **No standalone numerology, rune, or feng shui servers exist yet.**

## BaZi / Chinese Astrology

### cantian-ai/bazi-mcp

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [cantian-ai/bazi-mcp](https://github.com/cantian-ai/bazi-mcp) | 271 | TypeScript | Not specified | 1 |

The **highest-starred server in this entire category by a wide margin**. Billed as "the first AI-powered Bazi calculator," it computes the Four Pillars of Destiny (八字) from birth datetime:

- **Eight Characters** — heavenly stems and earthly branches for year, month, day, and hour pillars
- **Five Elements** — element distribution and balance analysis
- **Ten Gods** — relationship mapping between day master and other stems
- **Hidden stems** — auxiliary elements within each earthly branch
- **Major life phases** — decade-by-decade fortune periods
- **Compatibility** — element-based relationship analysis

Supports both solar and lunar datetime input. Despite having just one tool (`getBaziDetail`), the output is comprehensive. Derived from a popular GPT Store app and integrated with the cantian.ai commercial platform. The 271 stars and 96 forks show genuine demand for Chinese metaphysical calculations in AI workflows.

### AngusHsu/lunar-mcp-server

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [AngusHsu/lunar-mcp-server](https://github.com/AngusHsu/lunar-mcp-server) | 1 | Python | MIT | 20 |

A **broad Chinese calendar server** covering more ground than just BaZi. The 20 tools span six categories:

- **Auspicious dating** (4 tools) — check if dates are favorable for specific activities
- **Festival information** (4 tools) — traditional Chinese festival dates and details
- **Moon phases** (4 tools) — lunar cycle tracking
- **Calendar conversion** (3 tools) — solar/lunar date mapping
- **BaZi** (2 tools) — Four Pillars with element distribution and life stage insights
- **Advanced** (3 tools) — zodiac insights and combined analyses

Location-aware with timezone support. While low-starred, the tool breadth is impressive for a single server — effectively a complete traditional Chinese calendar toolkit.

## Western Astrology

### simpolism/AstroMCP

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [simpolism/AstroMCP](https://github.com/simpolism/AstroMCP) | 14 | TypeScript | Not specified | 1 |

Generates astrological charts from date, time, and location. Integrates the Photon API for geocoding (location name → coordinates) and the Simple Astro API for planetary calculations. Outputs planetary positions, house placements, aspect calculations, and natural-language interpretations via chart2txt. A clean, focused implementation for natal chart generation.

### dm0lz/swiss-ephemeris-mcp-server

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [dm0lz/swiss-ephemeris-mcp-server](https://github.com/dm0lz/swiss-ephemeris-mcp-server) | 7 | JavaScript | MIT | 4 |

The **most astronomically rigorous** open-source option. Four tools built directly on Swiss Ephemeris:

- `calculate_planetary_positions` — all planets, lunar nodes, 6 asteroids (Chiron, Ceres, Pallas, Juno, Vesta, Lilith), 12 houses (Placidus), chart angles
- `calculate_transits` — current planetary positions relative to natal chart
- `calculate_solar_revolution` — solar return charts
- `calculate_synastry` — relationship compatibility between two charts

Docker support with HTTP transport. This is the server to pick if you want raw astronomical precision without interpretive layers.

### intellecat/astrology-mcp

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [intellecat/astrology-mcp](https://github.com/intellecat/astrology-mcp) | 0 | TypeScript | AGPL-3.0 | 2 |

Natal chart calculations using the @swisseph/node bindings. Supports **six house systems** (Placidus, Koch, Equal, Whole Sign, Campanus, Regiomontanus) — more than most other servers. Outputs planets, houses, aspects, retrograde status, and chart angles. The AGPL-3.0 license is worth noting for anyone planning commercial use.

### Additional Western Astrology Servers

- **Tristan-hsu/natal_mcp** (1 star, Python, MIT, ~6 tools) — natal, transit, synastry, and solar return charts using the natal library, SVG output, caching, markdown/HTML reports

Supports 11 celestial bodies including Chiron. The remote MCP model (connect via URL, no local setup) makes this ideal for quick integrations. Created by Matt Kane.

## Tarot

### fzlzjerry/tarot-mcp

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [fzlzjerry/tarot-mcp](https://github.com/fzlzjerry/tarot-mcp) | 7 | TypeScript | Not specified | 8 |

The **most feature-rich tarot server**. Full Rider-Waite 78-card deck with 11 professional spreads plus custom spread creation (1-15 positions). Key features:

- **Cryptographically secure shuffling** — uses crypto-grade randomization, not Math.random()
- **Elemental analysis** — element distribution across drawn cards
- **Context-aware interpretations** — readings consider card position and surrounding cards
- **Custom spreads** — create your own layouts with named positions
- **Multiple transports** — stdio, HTTP API, and SSE

|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [junebash/swift-tarot-mcp](https://github.com/junebash/swift-tarot-mcp) | 6 | Swift | MIT | 3 |

A **Swift-native implementation** — the only non-TypeScript tarot server. Three tools: draw cards, get the full deck, and fetch card images (base64-encoded). Uses **seeded RNG** for deterministic card selection during testing — a nice touch for reproducibility. Requires macOS 13.0+ / Swift 5.9+.

## I Ching / Chinese Divination

### threemachines/i-ching

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [threemachines/i-ching](https://github.com/threemachines/i-ching) | 10 | Rust | MIT | 2+ |

Determines Type (Manifestor/Generator/Manifesting Generator/Projector/Reflector), Strategy, Authority, Profile, active gates and lines, defined centers, and Incarnation Cross. Uses Swiss Ephemeris under the hood. Compatible with n8n and Claude Desktop. The only Human Design MCP server we found — a niche within a niche.

## Commercial / Hosted MCP Services

### Astrology-API.io

A **production-grade commercial platform** offering MCP access with 16 tools across two namespaces:

- **Basic** — natal charts, transits, synastry, composite charts
- **Astrocartography** — relocation analysis, power zones, paran mapping

Technical specifications: 23 house systems, 97+ Arabic parts/lots, fixed stars support, 9+ language AI interpretations, Swiss Ephemeris precision (0.001 arcsecond), 99.95% uptime SLA, 2M+ monthly calculations. Free tier (50 requests/month), Pro at $11/month, scaling to Enterprise at $399+/month. The most technically rigorous commercial offering.

### RoxyAPI

The **broadest commercial mystical API** with native MCP support. Covers 8 domains with 110+ total endpoints:

- Western Astrology (23+ endpoints)
- Vedic Astrology (40+ endpoints)
- Tarot Reading (10+ endpoints)
- Numerology (13 endpoints)
- I Ching Oracle (9 endpoints)
- Dream Interpretation (5+ endpoints)
- Crystals & Healing Stones (12 endpoints)
- Angel Numbers (4 endpoints)

Uses NASA JPL ephemerides. Pricing from $39-$699/month with one key covering all domains. Native MCP support for OpenAI, Gemini, and Claude agents. If you want maximum breadth across mystical traditions from a single API key, this is the only option.

## What's Missing

The astrology and divination MCP space has notable gaps:

- **Numerology** — no standalone open-source server (only available via commercial APIs)
- **Rune divination** — zero implementations (Norse runes, ogham, etc.)
- **Feng shui** — no calculator or analysis server
- **Palmistry / face reading** — no computer vision-based implementations
- **Western horary astrology** — only available via commercial AstroVisor
- **Vedic astrology (standalone)** — no fully open-source Jyotish server with Dasha calculations

## Rating: 3.5/5

**What works:** BaZi has a genuinely popular implementation (271 stars). Swiss Ephemeris provides astronomical rigor. Tarot servers have proper randomization and professional spreads. The I Ching server respects the Wilhelm-Baynes tradition. ephemeris.fyi offers zero-setup remote access. Two commercial platforms provide comprehensive coverage.

**What doesn't:** Most servers are low-star individual projects (under 15 stars). No numerology, runes, or feng shui. Vedic astrology depends entirely on commercial APIs. The gap between the commercial offerings (100+ endpoints) and open-source (1-11 tools) is the widest we've seen in any vertical. Human Design has a single zero-star server.

**Who should care:** Developers building AI assistants with spiritual or wellness features, astrology app developers looking for MCP-powered backends, Chinese metaphysics practitioners wanting AI-assisted chart analysis, and anyone curious about connecting ancient divination systems to modern AI agents.

**Bottom line:** This category reveals genuine cultural diversity in the MCP ecosystem — Chinese, Western, and cross-traditional systems all have representation. The BaZi server's 271 stars prove there's real demand. But the open-source implementations are thin individually, and anyone wanting production-grade coverage will likely need a commercial API. The free ephemeris.fyi remote server is the easy on-ramp for experimentation.
