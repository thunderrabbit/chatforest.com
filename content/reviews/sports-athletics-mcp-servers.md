card_description: "Sports and athletics MCP servers for AI-powered live scores, player analytics, fantasy league management, betting odds tracking, fitness data access, and motorsport telemetry. This is one of the most active MCP categories — developers clearly love building sports tools. **Multi-sport platforms provide broad coverage** — mikechao/balldontlie-mcp (23 stars, TypeScript, MIT) covers NBA, NFL, and MLB through the Balldontlie API with 4 tools for teams, players, and games. The SportRadar MCP server covers NFL, NBA, NHL, Soccer, and Tennis from a single commercial API (requires API key). ESPN's public data is accessible through Apify-hosted MCP servers covering scores, standings, stats, news, and odds across major leagues. **Basketball has the deepest single-sport coverage** with 6+ dedicated NBA MCP servers — labeveryday/nba_mcp_server leads with 30 tools covering live scores, advanced analytics (TS%, ORtg, DRtg, USG%, PIE), shot charts with zone breakdowns, hustle stats, and player headshots from NBA's CDN. nikhilkichili/nba-analytics-mcp adds betting odds tracking with line movement detection and AI/ML game simulations. **Football/soccer is well-represented** — obinopaul/soccer-mcp-server (17 tools via API-Football) covers leagues globally with live match events, player profiles, and team data. yeonupark/mcp-soccer-data (28 stars) focuses on live scores with betting odds integration. **Formula 1 is remarkably well-served** with 7+ implementations — Panth1823/formula1-mcp (15 stars, 29 tools) combines OpenF1 real-time data with Ergast historical data back to 1950, covering telemetry, team radio, pit stops, tire strategy, and weather. stagsz/F1-MCP-Server adds Monte Carlo race strategy simulation and tire degradation modeling. **Fantasy sports have a dedicated platform** — jdguggs10/flaim connects ESPN, Yahoo, and Sleeper fantasy leagues to AI assistants with read-only access across Football, Baseball, Basketball, and Hockey. KBThree13/mcp_espn_ff (29 stars) focuses specifically on ESPN Fantasy Football with private league support. **Betting odds are covered** — WFord26/BetTrack (30+ tools, 70+ markets) combines The Odds API data with bet tracking, line movement analysis, and a retro web dashboard. kitchenchem/degen-mcp provides simpler odds comparison across bookmakers. **Fitness tracking is the star of this category** — Taxuspt/garmin_mcp (271 stars, 96+ tools) wraps 89% of Garmin Connect's API covering activities, health metrics, sleep, stress, nutrition, and workouts. r-huijts/strava-mcp (276 stars, 25 tools) provides running/cycling analytics with GPX export and training zone visualization. gesteves/domestique unifies Intervals.icu, Whoop, and TrainerRoad data. AI Endurance offers a commercial MCP for cycling/running/swimming training plans. **Pro cycling has dedicated coverage** — r-huijts/firstcycling-mcp (18 stars, 20 tools) provides rider profiles, race results, Grand Tour data, and historical statistics. **Cricket and hockey round out individual sports** — tarun7r/cricket-mcp-server (11 stars, 9 tools) covers Cricbuzz data with ICC rankings and live commentary. dylangroos/nhl-mcp (10 tools) provides NHL team data, standings, and live scores. **Gaps remain** — no rugby union/league servers, no dedicated tennis server (only via SportRadar), no Olympic/athletics data, no esports, no sports news aggregation, no youth/amateur sports. The category earns 4/5 — exceptional breadth across major sports with particularly strong fitness tracking and motorsport coverage, though some individual sports lack dedicated servers."

Sports and athletics MCP servers let AI assistants access live scores, player statistics, fantasy league data, betting odds, fitness metrics, and motorsport telemetry. Instead of manually checking scores, navigating fantasy platforms, or compiling training data, these servers let AI agents pull real-time game information, analyze player performance, manage fantasy rosters, track betting lines, and review workout history — all through the Model Context Protocol.

This review covers the **sports and athletics** vertical — multi-sport data platforms, basketball, football/soccer, ice hockey, Formula 1, fantasy sports, betting odds, fitness/training, pro cycling, and cricket. For health and wellness wearables beyond sports, see our [Health & Wellness MCP review](/reviews/health-wellness-mcp-servers/).

The headline findings: **Fitness tracking leads the category** with strava-mcp (276 stars) and garmin_mcp (271 stars) being among the highest-starred servers in any MCP category. **Formula 1 has disproportionate coverage** with 7+ implementations for a single racing series. **Basketball (NBA) has the deepest analytics** with 30-tool servers covering shot charts and hustle stats. **Fantasy sports and betting odds are well-covered.** **Cricket and hockey have dedicated servers, but rugby, tennis, and esports are missing.**

## What's Missing

Despite 50+ servers, several gaps remain:

- **Rugby** — no rugby union or rugby league servers
- **Tennis** — no dedicated server (only available through multi-sport SportRadar MCP)
- **Golf** — PGA reportedly has an official MCP, but no open-source implementations found
- **Olympic sports / Athletics** — no track & field, swimming, gymnastics data
- **Esports** — no League of Legends, CS2, Dota 2, or Valorant servers despite massive data APIs
- **Youth / amateur sports** — all servers focus on professional leagues
- **Sports news aggregation** — no dedicated sports journalism or highlight servers
- **Baseball-specific** — only via multi-sport servers (Balldontlie, ESPN), no dedicated deep MLB analytics server beyond the SportRadar wrapper

## Bottom Line

**Rating: 4/5** — Sports and athletics is one of the strongest MCP categories by volume and quality. Fitness tracking leads with two 270+ star servers (Strava and Garmin) offering genuinely comprehensive data access. Formula 1 has research-grade analytics with tire modeling and race strategy simulation. NBA coverage goes deep into advanced stats and shooting charts. Fantasy sports and betting odds are well-served. The main gaps are individual sports (tennis, rugby, golf) and esports. For anyone building sports-related AI tools, the ecosystem is already remarkably mature.
