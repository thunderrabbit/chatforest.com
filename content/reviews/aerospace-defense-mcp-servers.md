card_description: "Aerospace and defense MCP servers across NASA data access, orbital mechanics, aviation operations, drone control, satellite tracking, and earth observation. The space data landscape is anchored by ProgramComputer/NASA-MCP-server (80 stars, TypeScript) providing AI access to 20+ NASA APIs — Astronomy Picture of the Day, Mars Rover Photos, Near Earth Objects, Space Weather (DONKI), Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera, and the Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker. For orbital mechanics, IO-Aerospace's MCP server stands out as a production-ready .NET implementation powered by the SPICE astrodynamics library (used by NASA/ESA/JAXA), hosted publicly at mcp.io-aerospace.org with streamable HTTP — no local install needed. alti3/stk-mcp (20 stars, Python) bridges LLMs to Ansys STK (Systems Tool Kit), the industry-standard digital mission engineering software used by NASA, ESA, Boeing, and defense agencies for satellite configuration, orbit analysis, and access computations. BuildASpacePro/Orbit-MCP provides satellite access window calculations with a built-in database of 200+ world cities and TLE generation across LEO, MEO, GEO, SSO, Molniya, and polar orbits. Aviation gets the deepest coverage: cheesejaguar/aerospace-mcp is the most comprehensive server with 44+ tools spanning intelligent airport resolution (28,000+ airports), great-circle routing, aircraft performance estimation, atmospheric modeling, and a complete orbital mechanics suite — a true dual-use aviation-and-space platform. For weather specifically, blevinstein/aviation-mcp maps directly to FAA Aviation Weather APIs with METAR, TAF, PIREP, SIGMET, and G-AIRMET data plus sectional charts, while finack/aviation-mcp focuses on flight planning weather briefs. Real-time flight tracking comes from Pradumnasaraf/aviationstack-mcp using the AviationStack API. Drone control has two notable implementations: ion-g-ion/MAVLinkMCP enables natural language drone control via the MAVLink protocol for PX4 and ArduPilot platforms (used on millions of drones worldwide), while 0xKoda/drone-mcp provides basic DJI Tello control. Satellite tracking is served by MaxwellCalkin/N2YO-MCP querying the N2YO space catalog for TLE data, real-time positions, pass predictions, and space debris monitoring across military, weather, GPS, amateur, and Starlink categories. Earth observation has Dhenenjay's Axion MCP (190 stars) for Google Earth Engine satellite imagery analysis with NDVI/NDWI vegetation indices and crop classification. GIS tools round out the category with geocoding, routing, and spatial analysis. The notable absence: no defense-specific MCP servers exist. No defense contractors (Lockheed Martin, Boeing Defense, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon) have released MCP servers, and there are no servers for radar, electronic warfare, command and control, missile defense, or military logistics. Cybersecurity MCP servers (covered in our security reviews) serve adjacent use cases. The category earns 3.5/5 — strong community-built coverage for space science, aviation, and earth observation, with IO-Aerospace and NASA MCP leading on technical depth, but the defense side is entirely absent and aviation weather has significant overlap with our Weather & Climate review."

Aerospace and defense MCP servers are enabling AI agents to query NASA's vast data archives, simulate orbital mechanics with SPICE-level accuracy, control drones via natural language, fetch aviation weather for flight planning, track satellites in real time, and analyze earth observation imagery — all through natural language. Instead of writing Python scripts to query the APOD API or manually running STK scenarios, an AI agent can handle it conversationally: "Show me near-earth asteroids approaching within 5 lunar distances this week, then calculate an observation window from my location."

This review covers the **aerospace and defense** vertical — space data access, orbital mechanics, aviation operations, drone/UAV control, satellite tracking, and earth observation. For weather data more broadly, see our [Weather & Climate MCP review](/reviews/weather-climate-mcp-servers/). For geospatial mapping platforms (Mapbox, Google Maps), see our [Geospatial & Mapping MCP review](/reviews/geospatial-mapping-mcp-servers/). For cybersecurity tools, see our [Code Security MCP review](/reviews/code-security-mcp-servers/).

The landscape spans seven areas: **NASA & space data** (APOD, Mars rovers, NEO, space weather), **orbital mechanics & astrodynamics** (SPICE, STK, orbital propagation), **aviation** (FAA APIs, airport databases, flight tracking, weather), **drones & UAV** (MAVLink, DJI Tello), **satellite tracking** (TLE data, pass predictions, space debris), **earth observation** (Google Earth Engine, satellite imagery analysis), and **GIS & spatial analysis** (geocoding, routing, coordinate transforms).

The headline findings: **NASA has the best-developed space data MCP** with 20+ APIs in one server. **IO-Aerospace provides production-grade astrodynamics** with a hosted endpoint anyone can use. **Aviation is the most mature subcategory** with 44+ tools in a single comprehensive server. **MAVLink MCP bridges AI to millions of real drones** via the standard drone protocol. **Defense is completely absent** — no defense contractors or military-adjacent tools exist in the MCP ecosystem.

These complement the earth observation servers by providing ground-level geospatial analysis — useful for combining satellite imagery with local geographic data.

## Defense & Military

### The Missing Category

As of March 2026, **no dedicated defense MCP servers exist in the public ecosystem**. This is the most notable gap:

- **No defense contractors** — Lockheed Martin, Boeing Defense, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, General Dynamics, and BAE Systems have no public MCP servers
- **No radar or electronic warfare** tools
- **No command and control (C2)** systems integration
- **No missile defense** or weapons systems modeling
- **No military logistics** or force deployment planning
- **No classified/controlled data access** — unsurprising given security requirements
- **No NATO or military standard** protocol bridges (STANAG, MIL-STD)

This absence is understandable: defense systems operate in classified environments with strict access controls, and the MCP protocol's open nature doesn't align with military security requirements. However, some adjacent tools serve dual-use purposes:

- **Cybersecurity MCP servers** (covered in our [Code Security review](/reviews/code-security-mcp-servers/)) — offensive and defensive security tooling
- **STK MCP** (above) — used by defense agencies for mission engineering
- **Satellite tracking** — space domain awareness has both civilian and military applications
- **MAVLink MCP** — the same protocol used for both commercial and military drones

## What's missing

Beyond the defense gap, several aerospace areas lack MCP coverage:

- **No official NASA/ESA/JAXA MCP servers** — all implementations are community-built
- **No FlightAware or FlightRadar24** — the two most popular flight tracking platforms have no MCP servers
- **No OpenSky Network or ADS-B Exchange** — open ADS-B data sources aren't MCP-enabled
- **No air traffic control** simulation or data
- **No GNSS/GPS** precision tools or RTK correction services
- **No CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics)** integration (OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent)
- **No FEA (Finite Element Analysis)** tools beyond MATLAB
- **No spacecraft bus design** or mission lifecycle management
- **No launch vehicle operations** — no SpaceX, Rocket Lab, or ULA integration
- **No space weather forecasting** beyond NASA DONKI's historical data
- **No aircraft maintenance** (EASA/FAA Part 145) or airworthiness management
- **No UAS traffic management (UTM)** for drone operations in controlled airspace
- **No propulsion simulation** or engine performance modeling
- **No materials science** databases for aerospace-grade materials (MMPDS, CMH-17)

## The bottom line

Aerospace and defense MCP servers earn **3.5 out of 5**. The rating reflects a category with genuine technical depth in specific niches — IO-Aerospace's SPICE-powered astrodynamics, NASA's 20+ API gateway, cheesejaguar's 44-tool aviation suite, and MAVLink's universal drone protocol bridge — offset by the complete absence of defense applications and fragmented coverage elsewhere. Aviation weather overlaps heavily with our Weather & Climate review. No space agencies or aerospace OEMs have released official MCP servers, which is unusual compared to other industries where official vendor servers are increasingly common.

**Best for space science:** ProgramComputer/NASA-MCP-server for data access, IO-Aerospace for orbital calculations, STK MCP for mission engineering

**Best for aviation:** cheesejaguar/aerospace-mcp for comprehensive flight planning, blevinstein/aviation-mcp for FAA weather data, aviationstack-mcp for flight tracking

**Best for drones:** MAVLinkMCP for serious drone development, drone-mcp for educational Tello projects

**Best for earth observation:** Axion MCP for Google Earth Engine satellite imagery analysis

The category will likely grow significantly as space becomes more commercialized and as drone delivery and urban air mobility create demand for AI-integrated aerospace operations.
