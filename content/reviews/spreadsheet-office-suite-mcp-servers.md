card_description: "Spreadsheet and office suite MCP servers for AI-powered document creation, spreadsheet automation, and office workflow management. **Google Workspace gets a comprehensive 1,800-star server** — taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp (MIT, Python) covers Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Calendar, Forms, Tasks, Chat, Contacts, Custom Search, and Apps Script in a single MCP server. OAuth 2.0/2.1 authentication with multi-user support, CLI mode for scripting, and tool filtering to reduce context usage. This is the most complete office productivity MCP server available — one server to control your entire Google Workspace. **Microsoft Word has the second most-starred office MCP server** — GongRzhe/Office-Word-MCP-Server (1,700 stars, Python) provides rich document manipulation: create documents, insert headings/paragraphs/tables/images/page breaks, format text (bold, italic, underline, colors, fonts), manage tables (cell shading, merging, alignment, padding, column width), search and replace, document protection with passwords and digital signatures, comment extraction, PDF conversion, footnotes/endnotes, and document merging. It uses python-docx under the hood, so no Microsoft Office installation required. **Google Sheets is the most-contested subcategory** — 8+ independent MCP server implementations compete for the same use case. xing5/mcp-google-sheets (737 stars, Python) leads with 19 tools covering list/create/read/write/search/share/batch operations, 4 authentication methods (Service Account, OAuth 2.0, direct credentials, Application Default), and zero-install deployment via uvx. mkummer225/google-sheets-mcp, domdomegg/google-sheets-mcp, shionhonda/mcp-gsheet, freema/mcp-gsheets, isaacphi/mcp-gdrive, ajaysmb/gsheets-mcp, and kazz187/mcp-google-spreadsheet all offer overlapping functionality. The fragmentation means users have choices, but also means no single implementation has consolidated community effort. **Excel MCP servers split between file-based and COM-based approaches** — negokaz/excel-mcp-server (878 stars, Go, MIT) works cross-platform by reading/writing XLSX files directly — 7 tools for describing sheets, reading data with pagination, writing cells, creating tables, copying sheets, formatting ranges, and capturing screenshots (Windows only). sbroenne/mcp-server-excel (76 stars, C#, MIT) takes the opposite approach — it controls a live Excel application through COM API on Windows, providing 25 tools with 225+ operations covering Power Query, DAX measures, VBA macros, PivotTables, Charts, Slicers, Conditional Formatting, Named Ranges, Data Connections, and calculation mode control. If you need Power Query or PivotTables, this is the only option. haris-musa/excel-mcp-server, yzfly/mcp-excel-server, guillehr2/Excel-MCP-Server-Master, and ArchimedesCrypto/excel-reader-mcp provide additional Python and TypeScript alternatives. **Google Docs gets dedicated coverage** — a-bonus/google-docs-mcp (377 stars, TypeScript, MIT) provides full Google Docs API access including document reading (plain text, JSON, markdown), text insertion and styling (bold, italic, colors, fonts, links), paragraph formatting, tables, images, page breaks, multi-tab documents, and comment management (create, reply, resolve, delete). Also covers Google Sheets (ranges, formatting, dropdowns, named tables) and Google Drive (search, create, move, copy, rename). **The multi-document generation server is worth noting** — dvejsada/mcp-ms-office-documents (18 stars, MIT, Python) generates PowerPoint, Word, Excel, and HTML email files from a single MCP server. Supports dynamic templates with {{placeholder}} syntax, formula support in spreadsheets, cloud storage integration (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob, MinIO), time-limited download links, Docker deployment, and optional API key authentication. Ideal for automated report generation workflows. **LibreOffice gets MCP adapters** — WaterPistolAI/libreoffice-mcp (17 stars, Python) is the most comprehensive, supporting Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, and Base with charts, conditional formatting, macros, and form controls. It requires LibreOffice running with a socket connection. patrup/mcp-libre provides native embedded MCP integration directly within LibreOffice. harshithb3304/libre-office-mcp offers another Python bridge. **Generic spreadsheet tools exist** — PSU3D0/spreadsheet-mcp (39 stars, Rust) is designed specifically for LLM agents with token-efficient dense JSON encoding, a native formula recalculation engine (Formualizer), batch operations, diff detection between workbook versions, and deterministic pagination. Supports .xlsx/.xlsm read+write and .xls/.xlsb discovery. Slim Docker image at 15MB. **OfficeMCP automates the full Microsoft Office suite** — OfficeMCP/OfficeMCP (63 stars, Python) controls Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Access, OneNote, Publisher, Visio, and Project via Windows COM interface. Also supports WPS Office. Windows-only by nature. Includes demo modes, text-to-speech, and Python code execution within the server context. **Microsoft's official MCP catalog exists** — microsoft/mcp (2,800 stars, C#) provides Azure MCP Server and Microsoft Fabric MCP Server, with pointers to additional official servers for Azure DevOps, AKS, Microsoft 365, and more. This is the official Microsoft entry point for MCP. **Major gaps remain** — no real-time collaborative editing through MCP (Google Docs collaboration is view/edit, not live co-authoring). No OneDrive-specific MCP server (Drive operations are covered by workspace servers). No Notion-to-Office format bridge. No Apple Numbers MCP server. No WPS Office standalone MCP (OfficeMCP covers it via COM on Windows). No spreadsheet-only visualization/charting server (charts exist within broader servers). No conflict resolution for concurrent multi-agent edits to the same document. The category earns 4/5 — the spreadsheet and office suite MCP ecosystem is genuinely strong. Google Workspace gets the best single-server coverage at 1,800 stars with 12+ services. Word document creation is mature at 1,700 stars. Google Sheets has the most competitive subcategory with 8+ implementations. Excel splits intelligently between cross-platform file manipulation and Windows-native COM automation. LibreOffice has working adapters. The main weakness is fragmentation — rather than one great Google Sheets server, there are 8 adequate ones. But the category covers the core office productivity workflow well: create documents, manage spreadsheets, automate workspace operations."

Controls **the entire Microsoft Office suite** via Windows COM interface:

- Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Access, OneNote, Publisher, Visio, Project
- Also supports WPS Office
- Application launching, visibility control, file management
- Demo modes for each application
- Python code execution within server context

Windows-only by nature. More of an automation framework than a document manipulation tool — it launches and controls applications rather than directly editing file formats.

### microsoft/mcp (Official Microsoft)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Focus |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [microsoft/mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp) | 2,800 | C# | MIT | Azure + Fabric MCP |

The **official Microsoft MCP catalog** — provides core libraries, test frameworks, and two primary servers:

- **Azure MCP Server** — unified access to Azure services
- **Microsoft Fabric MCP Server** — AI-assisted development for Fabric workloads

Links to additional official Microsoft MCP servers for Azure DevOps, AKS, Microsoft 365, and data analytics platforms. This is Microsoft's entry point into the MCP ecosystem.

## What's missing

- **Real-time collaborative editing** — no server supports live co-authoring (Google Docs style)
- **OneDrive** — no dedicated MCP server (workspace servers cover Drive operations)
- **Apple Numbers** — no MCP server for Apple's spreadsheet app
- **WPS Office standalone** — only supported via OfficeMCP's COM on Windows
- **Conflict resolution** — no handling for concurrent multi-agent edits to the same document
- **Spreadsheet visualization** — no charting-only server (charts exist within broader servers)
- **Notion-to-Office bridge** — no format conversion between Notion and Office formats

## The bottom line

**Rating: 4/5** — The spreadsheet and office suite MCP ecosystem is genuinely strong. Google Workspace gets the best single-server coverage (1,800 stars, 12+ services). Word document creation is mature (1,700 stars). Google Sheets has the most competitive subcategory with 8+ implementations. Excel splits intelligently between cross-platform file manipulation (Go, 878 stars) and Windows-native COM automation (C#, 225+ operations). LibreOffice has working adapters. The Microsoft official catalog provides the institutional backing. The main weakness is fragmentation — rather than consolidating effort into one great Google Sheets server, the community has built 8 adequate ones. But the category covers the core office productivity workflow well: create documents, manage spreadsheets, automate workspace operations. If you use Google Workspace, install taylorwilsdon's server. If you work with Excel files, negokaz's Go server works everywhere. If you need Word documents, GongRzhe's server doesn't even need Office installed.
