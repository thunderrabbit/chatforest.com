The Linear MCP server is Linear's official, centrally hosted bridge between AI assistants and their project management system. Unlike many MCP servers that require local installation and API key management, Linear's server runs remotely at `mcp.linear.app` — you connect via OAuth, and Linear handles the rest.

The server provides 23+ tools covering the core project management lifecycle: creating and querying issues, managing projects and initiatives, working with cycles and milestones, commenting, and searching documentation. A February 2026 update expanded coverage significantly into product management territory with initiatives, milestones, and project updates.

Linear built this in partnership with Cloudflare and Anthropic, following the authenticated remote MCP specification (2025-03-26). It works natively with Claude, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Zed, Codex, and other MCP-compatible clients.

The key question: is Linear's remote-first approach to MCP better than the community-built local servers that came before it?

## What It Does

The Linear MCP server exposes tools across five functional categories:

**Querying entities (10 tools):**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_issues` | List issues with filtering by team, state, assignee, priority |
| `list_projects` | List projects with status filtering |
| `list_teams` | List all teams in the workspace |
| `list_users` | List workspace members |
| `list_documents` | List documents |
| `list_cycles` | List sprint cycles |
| `list_comments` | List comments on issues |
| `list_issue_labels` | List available issue labels |
| `list_issue_statuses` | List workflow states |
| `list_project_labels` | List project-level labels |

**Reading details (6 tools):**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_issue` | Get full details on a specific issue |
| `get_project` | Get project details and progress |
| `get_team` | Get team configuration |
| `get_user` | Get user profile |
| `get_document` | Get document content |
| `get_issue_status` | Get details on a workflow state |

**Creating resources (4 tools):**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_issue` | Create issues with title, description, team, assignee, priority, labels |
| `create_project` | Create new projects |
| `create_comment` | Add comments to issues |
| `create_issue_label` | Create new labels |

**Updating resources (2 tools):**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `update_issue` | Modify issue properties (status, assignee, priority, etc.) |
| `update_project` | Update project details |

**Knowledge (1 tool):**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_documentation` | Search Linear's documentation |

The February 2026 product management update added additional tools for initiatives (create, edit, update), project milestones (create, edit), project updates, initiative updates, project label management, and image loading support. This brings the total well above the original 23.

A notable design detail: the `list_issues` tool accepts "me" as a value for `assigneeId`, so agents can find your issues without needing to look up your user ID first. Priority levels are documented directly in the tool schema — "0 = No priority, 1 = Urgent, 2 = High, 3 = Normal, 4 = Low" — eliminating the need for external lookups.

## Setup

**Claude Desktop / claude.ai:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linear": {
      "url": "https://mcp.linear.app/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

First connection opens a browser for OAuth consent. Authorize with your Linear account and you're connected.

**Cursor / Windsurf / VS Code (via mcp-remote):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linear": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.linear.app/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

The `mcp-remote` module bridges the gap for clients that don't yet support remote MCP natively. Note that WSL users may need the `--transport sse-only` flag.

**Claude Code / Codex:**

```bash
claude mcp add linear --url https://mcp.linear.app/mcp
# or for Codex:
codex mcp add linear --url https://mcp.linear.app/mcp
```

**Troubleshooting:** If authentication gets stuck, clear the cache with `rm -rf ~/.mcp-auth`. Remote MCP connections are still early — connections may fail or require multiple attempts. Linear's docs recommend restarting your client or toggling the server off and on.

## Authentication

Linear's MCP server supports two authentication methods:

1. **OAuth 2.1 with dynamic client registration** — the primary method. The server follows the authenticated remote MCP spec, so your client handles the OAuth dance automatically. You authorize in the browser, and the client stores tokens locally.

2. **Direct API key / OAuth token via Authorization: Bearer header** — for app users, restricted access scenarios, or existing OAuth integrations that want to skip the interactive flow.

Personal API keys can be generated in Linear Settings > Security & Access > Personal API keys. OAuth applications can be created at `https://linear.app/settings/api/applications`.

The transport protocol is **Streamable HTTP** at `https://mcp.linear.app/mcp`. Linear previously supported SSE at `/sse`, but the February 2026 update announced that the `/sse` endpoint is being phased out in favor of the newer `/mcp` Streamable HTTP endpoint.

## What's Good

**The remote-first design is the right call.** No npm packages to install, no API keys to manage locally, no Node.js dependency. You point your MCP client at a URL, authenticate via OAuth, and you're done. This is how MCP servers should work for SaaS products — the vendor hosts it, handles authentication, and manages updates. You always get the latest tools without updating anything locally.

**Thoughtful API abstraction.** Linear's underlying API is GraphQL, which is powerful but verbose and complex for AI agents. The MCP server flattens GraphQL's nested filter objects into simple, flat parameters. Instead of constructing `{ filter: { assignee: { id: { eq: "..." } } } }`, an agent just passes `assigneeId: "..."`. This is a deliberate design decision that reduces token consumption and makes it easier for models to construct correct tool calls. The Fiberplane analysis noted that this approach represents "a middle ground between raw API exposure and opinionated task automation."

**Explicit value mappings reduce errors.** Priority levels, status values, and other enums are documented directly in the tool schemas. The agent doesn't need to make a separate call to figure out what priority values are valid before creating an issue. Small detail, large impact on reliability.

**Product management depth.** The February 2026 update was significant — adding initiatives, milestones, project updates, and initiative updates moves the server beyond issue tracking into genuine product management territory. You can create an initiative, add milestones to projects, and post status updates — all from Cursor or Claude while reviewing code.

**Broad client support.** Linear provides explicit setup instructions for Claude (desktop and web), Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Zed, Jules, and v0 by Vercel. They clearly invested in making this work everywhere, not just in one ecosystem.

**Performance optimization.** The February 2026 update specifically called out "improved performance and reduced token usage through better tool documentation." They're actively refining tool descriptions to help models make better decisions with fewer tokens — a sign that Linear understands the practical constraints of LLM-driven workflows.

## What's Not

**High context cost.** The Fiberplane analysis measured the tool definitions at 17.3k tokens — expanding context usage from 61k to 78k tokens before any actual work begins. For agents with limited context windows, dedicating that much budget to tool definitions is expensive. There's no way to load a subset of tools (e.g., read-only tools only) to reduce this cost.

**Responses return too much data.** List operations return full objects including avatar URLs, timestamps, and metadata that agents rarely need. When you list issues to find one to update, you don't need every field — you need the ID, title, and status. The server doesn't offer a way to request concise vs. detailed responses, so every query consumes more tokens than necessary.

**Stringified JSON output.** Responses wrap data in escaped strings within text content blocks rather than using structured content. This forces models to parse character-by-character rather than working with structured data directly. It increases token consumption and adds unnecessary parsing complexity.

**No delete operations.** You can create issues, projects, comments, and labels, but you can't delete or archive any of them through the MCP server. For cleanup workflows or archiving completed work, you're back to the Linear app.

**Remote-only means no offline or custom deployments.** The server is centrally hosted by Linear. You can't run it locally, customize the tool definitions, add your own tools, or use it offline. If you need to integrate Linear data into a custom agent pipeline with additional logic, you'll need one of the community alternatives.

**Connection reliability.** Linear's own docs acknowledge that "remote MCP connections are still early and the connection may fail or require multiple attempts." This is honest but also reflects the reality — the remote MCP ecosystem is young, and occasional connection issues can disrupt workflows.

## Community & Alternatives

Before Linear shipped their official server (May 2025), the community built several alternatives:

- **jerhadf/linear-mcp-server** — The original community server with 344 stars and 57 forks. Now deprecated in favor of the official server. Last commit December 2024.
- **dvcrn/mcp-server-linear** — Supports multiple workspaces simultaneously via configurable tool prefixes. Uses local API keys, runs via stdio. Good option if you need multi-workspace support or local deployment.
- **cline/linear-mcp** — Built specifically for Cline users.
- **tacticlaunch/mcp-linear** — Community implementation using Linear's GraphQL API directly.
- **geropl/linear-mcp-go** — A Go implementation for teams that prefer Go over TypeScript.
- **keegancsmith/linear-issues-mcp-server** — Read-only access, simpler and lighter weight.

The community reception has been positive. The official server effectively consolidated a fragmented ecosystem — most community projects now recommend the official server for standard use cases. The community alternatives remain relevant for specific needs: multi-workspace support, local deployment, custom tooling, or read-only access.

## How It Compares

Linear's MCP server exists alongside several other project management MCP servers. Here's how they stack up:

| Feature | Linear | Asana | Atlassian (Jira) | Todoist |
|---------|--------|-------|-------------------|---------|
| **Official server** | Yes | Yes (V2) | Yes (Rovo) | Yes |
| **Transport** | Streamable HTTP | Streamable HTTP | Remote MCP | Streamable HTTP |
| **Auth** | OAuth 2.1 | OAuth | OAuth 2.1 | OAuth |
| **Hosting** | Remote (Linear) | Remote (Asana) | Remote (Cloudflare) | Remote (Todoist) |
| **Tool count** | 23+ | Dynamic/unlisted | Jira + Confluence + Compass | ~10 |
| **Setup complexity** | Low | Low | Low | Low |
| **Local option** | No (community only) | No | Community only | No |

**vs. Asana:** Asana's V2 MCP server (at `mcp.asana.com/v2/mcp`) takes a similar remote-first approach with OAuth and Streamable HTTP. Asana dynamically exposes tools rather than publishing a static list, which keeps definitions current but makes it harder to evaluate coverage upfront. Asana has the edge in enterprise access controls (Enterprise+ can manage MCP client access per-client). Linear has the edge in developer experience and tool documentation quality.

**vs. Atlassian (Jira/Confluence):** Atlassian's Rovo MCP server covers Jira, Confluence, and Compass in one server — broader scope than Linear's single-product focus. Atlassian launched with Anthropic as their first official partner and hosts on Cloudflare. The enterprise security story (OAuth 2.1, TLS 1.2+, per-user permission enforcement) is comprehensive. Linear is simpler to set up and better documented for individual developers; Atlassian targets larger organizations with more complex permission needs.

**vs. Todoist:** Todoist's MCP server (at `ai.todoist.net/mcp`) is simpler — roughly 10 tools focused on task CRUD and natural language task creation. It's a personal/small-team task manager, not a project management platform, so the comparison is limited. Todoist's natural language task creation ("Submit report by Friday 5pm #Work") is a nice touch that Linear doesn't offer.

**Linear's advantage:** Among project management MCP servers, Linear stands out for the quality of its tool design — flat parameters instead of nested objects, explicit value mappings, convenience features like "me" as an assignee value. The Fiberplane analysis specifically praised this thoughtful abstraction layer as a model for how MCP servers should be built.

## Recent Updates

- **May 2025:** Initial launch of the official remote MCP server at `mcp.linear.app/sse`. Partnership with Cloudflare and Anthropic. Core tools for issues, projects, comments.
- **February 2026:** Major product management expansion — initiatives, project milestones, project updates, initiative updates, project labels, image support. Performance optimizations and reduced token usage. SSE endpoint deprecation in favor of Streamable HTTP at `/mcp`. Broad URL-based resource loading.

## Who's It For

The Linear MCP server works best for **development teams already using Linear** who want to manage issues, projects, and sprints without leaving their editor. The sweet spot is Cursor or VS Code users who want to create issues from code context, check sprint status, or update issue states while reviewing PRs.

For **product managers**, the February 2026 update made it significantly more useful — creating initiatives, setting milestones, and posting project updates from Claude is a genuine workflow improvement.

For **teams evaluating Linear vs. alternatives**, the MCP server is a point in Linear's favor. The quality of the implementation — thoughtful abstraction, explicit documentation, broad client support — reflects Linear's developer-focused DNA.

For **teams needing heavy customization** — custom workflows, multi-workspace management, local deployment, or integration into complex agent pipelines — consider the community alternatives like dvcrn/mcp-server-linear alongside the official server.

## The Bottom Line

Linear's MCP server is a **4/5**. The tool design is among the best we've reviewed — flat parameter schemas, embedded enum values, and the "me" shortcut show a team that thought carefully about how AI agents actually use tool definitions. The February 2026 expansion into initiatives and milestones meaningfully broadened the server's utility beyond engineering task tracking.

But the high context cost (17.3k tokens), verbose responses, and remote-only deployment limit its flexibility. The missing delete/archive operations create gaps in workflow automation. And requiring a paid Linear subscription ($8/user/month) narrows the potential audience compared to servers for free tools.

Among project management MCP servers, Linear's is the most polished in tool design. Atlassian's Jira MCP has broader scope (Jira + Confluence + Compass), and Asana's has stronger enterprise controls, but neither matches Linear's attention to how agents actually consume tool schemas. If you're on Linear, connecting the MCP server is an easy recommendation.

**Rating: 4/5** — Best-in-class tool design with thoughtful schema abstractions, but high context cost, remote-only deployment, and paid platform requirement limit its reach.
