card_description: "Accounting and bookkeeping MCP servers for invoicing, expense tracking, financial reporting, and ledger management. This is one of the strongest vertical categories in the MCP ecosystem — both Xero and Intuit (QuickBooks) have shipped official MCP servers, making accounting one of the few domains where major vendors are actively embracing MCP. XeroAPI/xero-mcp-server (207 stars, MIT) leads with 50+ tools covering contacts, invoices, chart of accounts, payroll, and reporting. intuit/quickbooks-online-mcp-server (108 stars, Apache-2.0) provides 11 entity types with full CRUD operations. For Zoho Books, kkeeling/zoho-mcp (37 stars, MIT) offers 20+ tools across invoicing, contacts, expenses, and sales orders with multi-region support. The plain-text accounting community is well-represented — minhyeoky/mcp-server-ledger (45 stars) wraps Ledger CLI with 9 tools for balance queries, budget analysis, and financial reporting, while vanto/beanquery-mcp (41 stars) enables BQL queries against Beancount ledger files. Sage has an official Intacct MCP Server via its Developer Portal, built on their AI Gateway. Wave and FreshBooks have community servers. CData provides read-only JDBC-based servers for QuickBooks, Sage, Zoho Books, and MYOB. Odoo has multiple community implementations for ERP accounting modules. Major gaps: no official servers from Wave, FreshBooks, or MYOB; no payroll-focused servers (ADP and Gusto covered in HR review); no tax preparation or compliance servers (no TurboTax, H&R Block, or Avalara); limited multi-entity consolidation. The category earns 4.0/5 — the presence of two official vendor servers (Xero and QuickBooks) plus strong plain-text accounting coverage makes this one of the most production-ready MCP verticals."

Accounting MCP servers are connecting AI assistants to financial data, invoicing, and bookkeeping workflows. Instead of manually navigating QuickBooks or Xero to create invoices, pull reports, or reconcile transactions, these servers let AI agents query financial data, manage contacts, generate reports, and even submit transactions — all through the Model Context Protocol.

The landscape spans six areas: **cloud accounting platforms** (Xero, QuickBooks, Zoho Books, Wave, FreshBooks), **enterprise accounting** (Sage Intacct, Odoo ERP), **plain-text accounting** (Beancount, Ledger CLI), **CData connectors** (read-only JDBC bridges for multiple platforms), **Odoo ERP** (open-source accounting modules), and **specialized tools** (invoice automation, expense tracking).

The headline findings: **Two major vendors have official MCP servers** — Xero (207 stars, 50+ tools) and Intuit's QuickBooks (108 stars, 11 entity types with CRUD), making accounting one of the few domains where platform vendors are actively embracing MCP. **Sage has an official MCP server too** — available through the Sage Intacct Developer Portal as part of their AI Gateway initiative. **Plain-text accounting is well-served** — both Ledger CLI and Beancount have dedicated MCP servers with meaningful star counts. **Zoho Books has the most community implementations** — three independent servers plus a CData connector. **The biggest gap is tax and compliance** — no TurboTax, H&R Block, Avalara, or tax-filing MCP servers exist.

## Cloud Accounting Platforms

### Xero MCP Server (Official)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [XeroAPI/xero-mcp-server](https://github.com/XeroAPI/xero-mcp-server) | 207 | TypeScript | MIT | 50+ |

The **most comprehensive accounting MCP server** in the ecosystem. Published by Xero's official API team with 90 commits and 19 contributors — this is a serious, maintained integration.

Key capabilities include:

- **Contact management** — create, update, search contacts (customers and suppliers)
- **Invoice operations** — create, send, and manage invoices with line items
- **Chart of accounts** — access and manage the full account structure
- **Payroll** — employee and payroll data access
- **Reporting** — financial reports and business analytics

Supports two authentication modes: **Custom Connections** (client ID/secret for a single organization) and **Bearer Token** (multi-organization support at runtime). Requires Node.js v18+. The 50+ tool count is notably larger than most MCP servers, reflecting the breadth of Xero's accounting API.

### QuickBooks Online MCP Server (Official)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [intuit/quickbooks-online-mcp-server](https://github.com/intuit/quickbooks-online-mcp-server) | 108 | TypeScript | Apache-2.0 | 11 entity types |

Intuit's **official MCP server** for QuickBooks Online. Exposes 11 entity types — Account, Bill, Bill Payment, Customer, Employee, Estimate, Invoice, Item, Journal Entry, Purchase, and Vendor — each with Create, Read, Update, Delete, and Search operations.

Authentication uses OAuth 2.0 with automatic browser-based flow or environment variable configuration. Includes built-in error handling with diagnostic messaging. The repository has only 2 commits (created October 2025), suggesting it's an early official release, but the Intuit backing makes it notable.

The entity-based design is clean — rather than dozens of individual tools, it exposes CRUD operations per entity type, keeping the tool surface manageable while covering the core accounting workflow.

### QuickBooks MCP (Community — laf-rge)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [laf-rge/quickbooks-mcp](https://github.com/laf-rge/quickbooks-mcp) | 4 | TypeScript | — | 30+ |

The most feature-rich community QuickBooks server, designed for **financial professionals** who work with QBO daily. Key design decisions:

- **Natural language resolution** — vendor, account, and department names are resolved automatically without requiring internal QuickBooks IDs
- **Safe by default** — every create and edit operation defaults to draft/preview mode before committing changes
- **Unified query tool** — SQL-like queries work across all QuickBooks entities instead of entity-specific search tools
- **Financial reports** — Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet, and Trial Balance with breakdowns by month, department, or class
- **Production credentials** — supports local file storage or AWS Secrets Manager with automatic OAuth token refresh

Despite low stars, the draft-by-default safety model and natural language name resolution make this arguably more practical for day-to-day bookkeeping than the official server.

### QuickBooks MCP Server (Community — nikhilgy)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [nikhilgy/quickbooks-mcp-server](https://github.com/nikhilgy/quickbooks-mcp-server) | 8 | Python | — | Dynamic |

A "certified by MCP Review" server with a unique approach: **dynamic tool discovery**. Every time Claude Desktop launches, the most recent QuickBooks API tools are made available automatically. Supports both sandbox and production environments. Local-first architecture keeps data processing on the user's machine.

### Zoho Books MCP (kkeeling)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [kkeeling/zoho-mcp](https://github.com/kkeeling/zoho-mcp) | 37 | Python | MIT | 20+ |

The **most-starred Zoho Books MCP server**. Covers the full small-business accounting workflow:

- **Invoice management** — create, email, track payments, send reminders, void invoices
- **Contact operations** — manage customers and vendors with create, update, delete
- **Expense tracking** — record, categorize, and upload receipt documentation
- **Inventory items** — create and manage products/services
- **Sales orders** — generate and convert to invoices
- **Business dashboard** — metrics overview, overdue/unpaid invoices, recent payments

Includes pre-built prompts for common workflows like invoice collection, monthly invoicing, and expense tracking. Supports **7 Zoho regions** (US, EU, IN, AU, JP, UK, CA) — important since Zoho serves different markets with separate data centers.

### Zoho Bookkeeper MCP (bu5hm4nn)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [bu5hm4nn/zoho-bookkeeper-mcp](https://github.com/bu5hm4nn/zoho-bookkeeper-mcp) | 0 | TypeScript | MIT | 37 |

Built to address limitations in Zoho's own official MCP service. Notable design decisions:

- **File upload support** — proper multipart/form-data handling for PDF, image, and Office file attachments (a feature missing from many accounting MCP servers)
- **Curated tool set** — 37 focused tools versus 100+ in Zoho's official service, reducing token consumption and avoiding AI tool limits
- **Auto-refreshing tokens** — handles Zoho's 1-hour OAuth token lifetime with a 5-minute buffer
- **Docker-ready** — container support with health checks for orchestrated deployments

The 37-tool count covers journals, expenses, bills, invoices, contacts, and bank accounts with full CRUD operations.

### Zoho CRM + Books Unified (Mgabr90)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [Mgabr90/zoho-mcp-server](https://github.com/Mgabr90/zoho-mcp-server) | 2 | TypeScript | — | 17 |

A **unified CRM and accounting server** — bridges Zoho CRM deals with Zoho Books invoices. Automatically syncs CRM accounts with Books customers and can generate invoices directly from closed CRM deals. Useful for businesses that use both Zoho CRM and Zoho Books together.

### Wave MCP Server

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [vinnividivicci/wave_mcp](https://github.com/vinnividivicci/wave_mcp) | 9 | Python | MIT | 10 |

MCP integration for **Wave Accounting** (the free accounting platform popular with freelancers and small businesses). Ten tools cover:

- Automated expense creation from receipt data
- Income transaction generation from payment information
- Multi-business account support
- Vendor and customer search
- Account management

Uses Wave's GraphQL API. Wave's free pricing makes this an attractive option for users who want AI-assisted bookkeeping without subscription costs.

### FreshBooks MCP Server

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [roboulos/freshbooks-mcp](https://github.com/roboulos/freshbooks-mcp) | 0 | TypeScript | MIT | 5 |

A focused FreshBooks integration for invoicing and time tracking. Five tools: list invoices, send Saturday invoices (automated weekly dispatch), log time entries, generate revenue reports, and check auth status. Uses **Xano as an authentication backend** rather than direct OAuth — an unusual design choice that adds a dependency but simplifies credential management.

## Enterprise Accounting

### Sage Intacct MCP Server (Official)

Sage launched an **official MCP server** for Intacct through their Developer Portal in November 2025, built on Sage's AI Gateway. The server is built on top of Sage Intacct REST APIs and enables AI agents to orchestrate tasks, handle planning, and retrieve financial information. Available at developer.sage.com — notably, this is one of very few enterprise accounting vendors with an official MCP server.

CData also provides read-only MCP servers for both **Sage Intacct** and **Sage Cloud Accounting** via JDBC drivers, available on GitHub.

### Odoo ERP Accounting

Multiple community MCP servers connect to Odoo's open-source ERP accounting modules:

- **ivnvxd/mcp-server-odoo** — general-purpose Odoo MCP with HTTP transport, supports streamable-http protocol
- **hachecito/odoo-mcp-improved** — advanced tools across sales, purchasing, inventory, and accounting via XML-RPC
- **jeevanism/odoo-accounting-mcp** — focused specifically on journal entries and accounting data, designed for Claude Desktop
- **Odoo Apps Store** — official Odoo modules (`mcp_server` and `llm_mcp_server`) available for installation directly into Odoo instances

The Odoo ecosystem benefits from the platform's open-source nature — anyone can build and publish MCP integrations as Odoo modules.

## Plain-Text Accounting

### Ledger CLI MCP Server

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [minhyeoky/mcp-server-ledger](https://github.com/minhyeoky/mcp-server-ledger) | 45 | Python | MIT | 9 |

The **highest-starred accounting-specific MCP server** outside the major platforms. Wraps [Ledger CLI](https://ledger-cli.org/) — the original plain-text double-entry accounting tool — with 9 tools:

- **ledger_balance** — account balances with filtering and date ranges
- **ledger_register** — transaction register reports
- **ledger_accounts** / **ledger_payees** / **ledger_commodities** — reference data
- **ledger_budget** — budget analysis and comparison
- **ledger_print** / **ledger_stats** — formatted output and statistics
- **ledger_raw_command** — direct Ledger CLI access (with basic command injection prevention)

Available via Docker, Smithery installer, or uv package manager. For developers and finance professionals who keep their books in plain-text files, this is the most complete MCP integration available.

### Beancount MCP Servers

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [vanto/beanquery-mcp](https://github.com/vanto/beanquery-mcp) | 41 | Python | MIT | 2 |
| [StdioA/beancount-mcp](https://github.com/StdioA/beancount-mcp) | 8 | Python | MIT | 1 |

Two Beancount MCP implementations with different approaches:

**beanquery-mcp** (41 stars) is the more established option. Provides BQL (Beancount Query Language) access to ledger files through two tools (`set_ledger_file` and `run_query`) plus resources for table schemas and account lists. The BQL approach means AI assistants can write sophisticated financial queries against your ledger.

**beancount-mcp** (8 stars) adds **transaction submission** — not just querying but writing new transactions to the ledger. Supports both stdio and SSE transport. A more action-oriented complement to beanquery-mcp's read-focused design.

## CData Connectors

CData provides a standardized pattern of **read-only MCP servers** using JDBC drivers for multiple accounting platforms:

| Platform | GitHub Repository | Stars |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| QuickBooks Online | CDataSoftware/quickbooks-mcp-server-by-cdata | 13 |
| Sage Intacct | CDataSoftware/intacct-mcp-server-by-cdata | — |
| Sage Cloud Accounting | CDataSoftware/sage-cloud-accounting-mcp-server-by-cdata | — |
| Zoho Books | CDataSoftware/zoho-books-mcp-server-by-cdata | — |
| MYOB AccountRight | Available via CData Connect AI | — |

All follow the same 3-tool pattern: `get_tables`, `get_columns`, and `run_query`. Read-only by design — for full CRUD, CData pushes users toward their paid Connect AI platform. The Java/JDBC approach means heavier runtime requirements than native implementations, but the consistency across platforms is valuable for organizations using multiple accounting systems.

## Notable Gaps

- **No tax preparation** — TurboTax, H&R Block, TaxJar, and Avalara have no MCP servers; tax filing automation is completely absent
- **No payroll-first servers** — ADP, Gusto, and Paychex are covered in our [HR & Recruiting review](/reviews/hr-recruiting-mcp-servers/) but not in accounting-focused servers
- **No FreshBooks official** — despite FreshBooks' API maturity, only a community server with 0 stars exists
- **No Wave official** — Wave (now owned by H&R Block) has no official MCP presence
- **No MYOB native** — MYOB is only accessible through CData's JDBC bridge; no native MCP server exists
- **No multi-entity consolidation** — none of the servers support consolidating financials across multiple companies or entities
- **No bank feed integration** — no MCP servers for Plaid, Yodlee, or direct bank connections for transaction import
- **No expense management** — Expensify, Brex, Ramp, and SAP Concur have no MCP servers (though Brex has general API tools)
- **No audit trail** — none of the servers provide SOC 2 or audit-grade logging of AI-initiated financial changes

## The Bottom Line

Accounting and bookkeeping MCP servers earn **4.0 out of 5**. This is one of the strongest vertical categories in the MCP ecosystem, primarily because two major platform vendors — Xero and Intuit — have shipped official MCP servers. Add Sage Intacct's official server and Zoho's multiple community implementations, and you have coverage across the four largest cloud accounting platforms.

The official servers are a big deal. XeroAPI/xero-mcp-server (207 stars, 50+ tools, 19 contributors) is one of the most comprehensive vendor-built MCP servers in any category. Intuit's QuickBooks server, while newer with only 2 commits, provides clean CRUD access to 11 entity types. The community QuickBooks server from laf-rge deserves special mention for its draft-by-default safety model — a thoughtful approach to AI-assisted financial operations.

Plain-text accounting users are well-served. Ledger CLI (45 stars, 9 tools) and Beancount (41 stars for beanquery-mcp) both have mature MCP integrations, and the developer-oriented nature of these tools makes them natural fits for the MCP ecosystem.

The main weakness is breadth beyond the major platforms. Tax preparation, payroll, expense management, and bank feed integration are all missing. For businesses that live entirely within Xero or QuickBooks, the MCP experience is solid. For those needing a complete financial workflow — from bank feeds to tax filing — significant gaps remain.

**Best for Xero users:** [XeroAPI/xero-mcp-server](https://github.com/XeroAPI/xero-mcp-server) (207 stars, 50+ tools, official)

**Best for QuickBooks users:** [intuit/quickbooks-online-mcp-server](https://github.com/intuit/quickbooks-online-mcp-server) (official) or [laf-rge/quickbooks-mcp](https://github.com/laf-rge/quickbooks-mcp) (30+ tools, safer defaults)

**Best for Zoho Books:** [kkeeling/zoho-mcp](https://github.com/kkeeling/zoho-mcp) (37 stars, 20+ tools, multi-region)

**Best for plain-text accounting:** [minhyeoky/mcp-server-ledger](https://github.com/minhyeoky/mcp-server-ledger) (45 stars, Ledger CLI) or [vanto/beanquery-mcp](https://github.com/vanto/beanquery-mcp) (41 stars, Beancount)

**Best for free accounting:** [vinnividivicci/wave_mcp](https://github.com/vinnividivicci/wave_mcp) (9 stars, Wave Accounting)
