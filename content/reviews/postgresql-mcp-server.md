**At a glance:** PostgreSQL has the **richest MCP server ecosystem of any database**. The standout is [Postgres MCP Pro](https://github.com/crystaldba/postgres-mcp) (2.4k stars, MIT) from CrystalDBA — offering performance analysis, index tuning, and configurable read/write access. Vendor-backed servers from [Supabase](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-mcp) (2.6k stars), [Neon](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon) (565 stars), [pgEdge](https://github.com/pgEdge/pgedge-postgres-mcp) (91 stars), Azure, AWS, and [Google's MCP Toolbox](https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox) (13.5k stars) provide platform-specific integrations. Anthropic's original [reference PostgreSQL server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers-archived/tree/main/src/postgres) (now archived) helped catalyze the ecosystem.

PostgreSQL is the **world's most popular open-source relational database** — and it's not close. Originally developed at UC Berkeley in 1986 as the POSTGRES project, PostgreSQL now commands an **18.3% share of the relational database market** with over 39,000 verified enterprise users. The latest release is **PostgreSQL 18** (September 2025, currently at 18.2), which introduced async I/O for up to 3× storage read performance, virtual generated columns, `uuidv7()`, OAuth authentication, and temporal constraints. PostgreSQL's extensibility — with extensions like pgvector for AI embeddings, PostGIS for geospatial data, and pg_stat_statements for query analytics — makes it the default database for modern applications.

**Architecture note:** Unlike the AI provider reviews in our series, PostgreSQL doesn't have a single "official" MCP server from one company. Instead, the ecosystem is **distributed across multiple maintainers** — CrystalDBA, Supabase, Neon, pgEdge, AWS, Azure, Google, and independent developers — each serving different use cases. This distributed model means more choice but also more fragmentation.

## What's Available

### Postgres MCP Pro — crystaldba/postgres-mcp

The **most capable general-purpose PostgreSQL MCP server**, focused on database performance:

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| GitHub | [crystaldba/postgres-mcp](https://github.com/crystaldba/postgres-mcp) — 2.4k stars, 259 forks, 79 commits, MIT |
| Language | Python |
| Install | `pipx install postgres-mcp` or `docker pull crystaldba/postgres-mcp` |
| Transport | stdio + SSE |
| Created by | [CrystalDBA](https://www.crystaldba.ai/) |

**8 MCP tools:**

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `list_schemas` | Enumerate database schemas |
| `list_objects` | Browse schema objects (tables, views, sequences, etc.) |
| `get_object_details` | Inspect table structures, columns, constraints |
| `execute_sql` | Run queries with configurable read-only or unrestricted mode |

**Key differentiator:** Industrial-grade index tuning and performance analysis. The `analyze_workload_indexes` tool uses algorithms that go beyond simple CREATE INDEX suggestions — it evaluates workload-wide index interactions. Requires `pg_stat_statements` and `hypopg` extensions for full performance features.

### Supabase MCP — supabase-community/supabase-mcp

A **full platform management server** for Supabase (which runs PostgreSQL under the hood):

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|

### Anthropic's Archived Reference Server

Anthropic included a PostgreSQL server in the original [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) repository as a reference implementation. It has since been moved to [servers-archived](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers-archived/tree/main/src/postgres) and is **no longer maintained**. It provided read-only access with schema inspection — useful as an educational example but superseded by the community servers above.

The npm package [@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres) still exists but points to the archived codebase.

## PostgreSQL Background

| Aspect | Detail |

## Known Issues

1. **No single "official" PostgreSQL MCP server** — Unlike databases backed by a single company, PostgreSQL's community-driven nature means there's no canonical MCP server endorsed by the PostgreSQL Global Development Group. Developers must evaluate multiple options.

2. **Fragmented ecosystem** — With 10+ PostgreSQL MCP servers of varying quality, developers face choice overload. Postgres MCP Pro and Supabase MCP lead in stars, but different use cases call for different servers.

3. **Anthropic's reference server is archived** — The original MCP PostgreSQL server that helped launch the ecosystem is no longer maintained. Developers who set it up early may not realize it's been superseded.

4. **Security risks with write access** — Several servers support unrestricted SQL execution. Without careful configuration, an AI agent could `DROP TABLE` or corrupt data. Read-only mode should be the default for production databases.

5. **Vendor-specific servers create lock-in** — Supabase MCP, Neon MCP, and Azure PostgreSQL MCP tie you to their platforms. Migrating databases means switching MCP servers too.

6. **Performance features require extensions** — Postgres MCP Pro's best features (index tuning, slow query analysis) require `pg_stat_statements` and `hypopg` extensions. Not all managed PostgreSQL providers support these.

7. **Google Toolbox is not PostgreSQL-focused** — At 13.5k stars, googleapis/genai-toolbox is the highest-starred option, but it's a multi-database tool. PostgreSQL-specific features are limited compared to dedicated servers.

8. **Transport fragmentation** — Some servers use stdio only, others SSE, others remote hosting. No single transport works across all options, complicating setup for users with specific MCP client requirements.

9. **pgEdge and neverinfamous servers are early-stage** — pgEdge is beta; neverinfamous/postgres-mcp has only 5 stars despite 232 capabilities and 370 commits. Neither has been battle-tested at scale.

10. **No MCP server handles PostgreSQL extensions well** — While pg_stat_statements and HypoPG get some support, the broader extension ecosystem (pgvector, PostGIS, pg_cron, pg_partman) lacks deep MCP integration. An AI agent asking about vector similarity search or geospatial queries gets limited help.

## Bottom Line

**Rating: 4.5 out of 5**

PostgreSQL has the **deepest MCP server ecosystem of any database** — and it's not even close. Where most databases have zero or one MCP server, PostgreSQL has **10+ actively maintained options** spanning general-purpose tools, vendor-specific integrations, and specialized monitoring solutions.

**Postgres MCP Pro** (2.4k stars) is the standout for developers who want to bring AI-powered database expertise to any PostgreSQL instance. Its index tuning, workload analysis, and health monitoring tools go well beyond simple SQL execution. **Supabase MCP** (2.6k stars) leads for platform users, offering full Supabase lifecycle management. **Google's Toolbox** (13.5k stars) provides the most production-hardened infrastructure but sacrifices PostgreSQL depth for multi-database breadth.

The **4.5/5 rating** reflects the unmatched variety and quality of PostgreSQL MCP servers. Multiple high-quality options exist (Postgres MCP Pro, Supabase MCP, Neon MCP, Google Toolbox, AWS), the ecosystem is actively maintained with recent commits across all major servers, and both generic and vendor-specific needs are covered. It loses half a point for fragmentation (no canonical server, choice overload), security concerns with write-access defaults, and limited deep extension support (pgvector, PostGIS lack MCP integration).

**Who benefits most from PostgreSQL's MCP ecosystem:**

- **Database administrators** — Postgres MCP Pro's health analysis, index tuning, and slow query identification make it a powerful AI-assisted DBA tool for any PostgreSQL instance
- **Supabase/Neon/AWS users** — vendor-specific servers provide seamless integration with platform features beyond raw PostgreSQL
- **Application developers** — schema exploration and SQL execution via MCP lets AI assistants help write and debug database queries in context
- **DevOps teams** — MCP-PostgreSQL-Ops and similar monitoring-focused servers bring observability to AI workflows

**Who should be cautious:**

- **Production database operators** — carefully evaluate write-access defaults and configure read-only mode; an unconstrained AI agent executing SQL against production data is a significant risk
- **Extension-heavy users** — if your PostgreSQL setup relies heavily on pgvector, PostGIS, or pg_cron, current MCP servers provide limited extension-aware capabilities
- **Teams wanting simplicity** — the sheer number of options can be overwhelming; start with Postgres MCP Pro for general use or your vendor's server for platform-specific needs
