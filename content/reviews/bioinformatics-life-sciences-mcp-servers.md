Combined, these enable end-to-end AI-assisted drug discovery from target identification through lead optimization. **Community efforts are expanding** — MCPmed (German research group) has published 10 repos providing MCP wrappers for GEO gene expression, STRING protein interactions, PLSDB plasmid database, UCSC Cell Browser, EMBL-EBI proteins, and PubMed/arXiv/bioRxiv literature — plus a cookiecutter template and LLM tracing breadcrumbs. Their work is backed by a published paper (arXiv:2507.08055) calling for community-wide adoption of MCP-enabled bioinformatics services. **Healthcare and EHR access is emerging** — jmandel/health-record-mcp uses SMART on FHIR for secure EHR data access. wso2/fhir-mcp-server exposes any FHIR server as an MCP server. xSoVx/fhir-mcp provides PHI protection, audit logging, and HL7 terminology services. AWS HealthLake MCP Server offers 11 tools for FHIR resource management. These represent early healthcare interoperability infrastructure. **Gaps remain** — no AlphaFold MCP exists for direct structure prediction, no Galaxy workflow MCP wrapper for established bioinformatics pipelines, no KEGG pathway MCP, limited medical imaging (only DICOM metadata, no radiology AI), no single-cell analysis pipeline MCP beyond basic QC, and no EHR-integrated clinical decision support MCP. The Augmented-Nature ecosystem is impressive but most repos have under 25 stars, suggesting early adoption."

Bioinformatics and life sciences MCP servers let AI agents query protein databases, run sequence analysis, explore clinical trials, access drug discovery data, and interact with medical records. Instead of manually navigating database web interfaces or writing API scripts, AI assistants can directly search biological databases, analyze sequences, and synthesize research findings through natural language.

This review covers **bioinformatics and life sciences MCP servers** — protein/chemical databases, biomedical literature, clinical research, sequence analysis, systems biology, drug discovery, and healthcare interoperability. For related servers, see our [Scientific Research review](/reviews/scientific-research-mcp-servers/), [Data Science & Machine Learning review](/reviews/data-science-ml-mcp-servers/), and [Digital Twins & Simulation review](/reviews/digital-twins-3d-simulation-mcp-servers/).

The headline findings: **Protein and chemical databases have the strongest MCP coverage** — Augmented-Nature maintains 10+ servers wrapping every major biological database. **Integrated platforms lead adoption** — genomoncology/biomcp (241 stars) and Anthropic's official life-sciences marketplace (259 stars) provide one-stop biomedical querying. **Literature search is mature** — multiple PubMed MCPs exist with 60–105 stars. **Drug discovery has end-to-end coverage** — from target identification through patent search. **Clinical trials are well-served** with patient matching and trend analysis. **Gaps remain in medical imaging, AlphaFold, and Galaxy workflows.**

## What's Missing

Despite strong coverage, notable gaps remain:

- **AlphaFold** — no direct MCP server for AlphaFold structure prediction (gget-mcp wraps it indirectly)
- **Galaxy workflows** — no MCP wrapper for the Galaxy bioinformatics platform
- **Single-cell pipelines** — no comprehensive scRNA-seq pipeline MCP (only QC skills via Anthropic marketplace)
- **KEGG** — no MCP server for this widely-used pathway database
- **Medical imaging AI** — DICOM metadata access exists, but no radiology AI or pathology MCP servers
- **Nextflow/Snakemake** — no workflow engine MCP for orchestrating bioinformatics pipelines
- **EHR clinical decision support** — FHIR access exists but no clinical reasoning MCP
- **Multi-omics integration** — no MCP server combining genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data

## The Bottom Line

Bioinformatics and life sciences is one of the most active and well-organized MCP server categories. The Augmented-Nature ecosystem alone covers 10+ major biological databases. Combined with BioMCP's unified interface, robust PubMed and clinical trials servers, and an emerging FHIR/EHR infrastructure, researchers can build sophisticated AI-assisted biomedical workflows today. The drug discovery pipeline — from target identification through patent search — is particularly complete. The main gaps are in medical imaging, workflow orchestration, and multi-omics integration. **Rating: 4/5.**
