**At a glance:** Database migration and schema management MCP servers cover one of the most **foundational developer workflows** — safely evolving database schemas as applications change. Every non-trivial application needs schema migrations, yet the MCP ecosystem is strikingly thin. [Prisma's official MCP server](https://github.com/prisma/mcp) (built into CLI v6.6.0+) is the most complete, exposing migrate-dev, migrate-status, and migrate-reset alongside schema management and query execution. [Liquibase's AI Changelog Generator](https://www.liquibase.com/) (19 tools, private preview) converts natural language to production-ready XML changelogs with ephemeral H2 validation — but it's not generally available. [Google's MCP Toolbox for Databases](https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox) (13.5k stars) handles connection pooling and schema operations but isn't migration-specific. On the community side, [mcp-atlas](https://github.com/mpreziuso/mcp-atlas) (5 tools) brings declarative migrations and [drizzle-mcp](https://github.com/defrex/drizzle-mcp) covers the fastest-growing TypeScript ORM. Meanwhile, Flyway, Alembic, golang-migrate, Rails, Sequelize, TypeORM, and every online schema migration tool have **zero MCP servers**. This is the **sixteenth review in our [Developer Tools MCP category](/categories/developer-tools/)**.

The database management systems market ($84-132B in 2025, growing 16-18% annually) underscores how critical this tooling layer is. Schema migration tools are a subset with no standalone market sizing, but they're deeply embedded in every development workflow. Flyway and Liquibase are neck-and-neck leaders: Flyway is developer-oriented (10.7k GitHub stars), Liquibase is enterprise-oriented (5.2k stars). Atlas from Ariga (6.3k stars) is rising as a declarative alternative — "Terraform for databases" — that compares current vs. desired state. Prisma (43k stars) dominates the TypeScript ORM space with built-in schema management, and Drizzle (28k stars) is the fastest-growing challenger. The MCP gap is not in obscure tooling — it's in the tools developers use every day.

**Architecture note:** Database migration MCP servers follow three patterns. **ORM-embedded** servers (Prisma, Drizzle) run as part of the ORM's existing CLI — the MCP endpoint exposes the same migration commands developers already use (`prisma migrate dev`, `drizzle-kit generate`). **Tool-specific connectors** (mcp-atlas, django-migrations-mcp, mig2schema) wrap a standalone migration tool's CLI in an MCP interface, requiring the underlying tool to be installed. **Platform-level** servers (Google MCP Toolbox, FreePeak/db-mcp-server) provide database operations including schema inspection but treat migrations as one capability among many. A critical distinction: ORM-embedded servers only work with their specific schema format (Prisma schema, Drizzle config), while tool-specific connectors support whatever the underlying tool supports (Atlas handles 16 ORMs, Liquibase supports XML/YAML/JSON/SQL changelogs). No MCP server currently supports framework-agnostic migration workflows.

## What's Available

### Prisma MCP Server — Built into the Most Popular TypeScript ORM

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Repository | [prisma/mcp](https://github.com/prisma/mcp) |
| Language | TypeScript |
| License | Apache-2.0 |
| Version | Built into Prisma CLI v6.6.0+ |
| Transport | stdio (local), HTTP (remote for Prisma Postgres) |
| Creator | Prisma (official vendor) |

**Local MCP server** exposes migration and schema tools:

| Tool | Capability |
|------|-----------|
| migrate-status | Check current migration state against schema |
| migrate-dev | Create and execute new migrations from schema changes |
| migrate-reset | Reset database and re-apply all migrations |
| Schema management | Introspect and modify Prisma schema files |
| Query execution | Run queries against the connected database |
| Prisma Studio | Visual data browser and editor |

**Remote MCP server** (for Prisma Postgres) adds:

| Tool | Capability |
|------|-----------|
| Database provisioning | Create new Prisma Postgres instances |
| Backup management | Create and restore database backups |
| Connection management | Configure and rotate connection strings |

**Key differentiator:** The **only migration MCP server built directly into an ORM's CLI** — no separate installation, no sidecar, no additional configuration. Prisma is the most popular TypeScript ORM (43k GitHub stars), so the addressable user base is enormous. The local server covers the full migration lifecycle: check status, create migrations from schema diffs, execute them, and reset if needed. The remote server extends this to cloud database provisioning and backup for Prisma Postgres users. Works with Claude Desktop, VS Code, and any MCP host.

**Limitation:** ORM-locked — only works with Prisma's schema format. If your project uses Drizzle, TypeORM, Sequelize, Knex, or raw SQL migrations, this server is irrelevant. The remote MCP server is specific to Prisma Postgres, not general PostgreSQL. Migration features are local-only (stdio) — no remote migration execution. Prisma's opinionated schema format means teams using custom migration workflows can't adopt this without committing to Prisma's approach.

### Liquibase AI Changelog Generator MCP — Enterprise Migrations Meet Natural Language

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Distribution | [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.com/) (private preview, registration required) |
| Language | Java |
| License | Liquibase proprietary |
| Version | Requires Liquibase 5.0+ (released September 2025) |
| Transport | MCP standard (Claude Desktop, VS Code, any MCP host) |
| Creator | Liquibase (official vendor) |

**19 precisely defined tools** that use Liquibase's native Java APIs:

| Tool Pattern | Capability |
|------|-----------|
| Changelog generation | Convert natural language descriptions to production-ready Liquibase XML changelogs |
| Validation | Auto-validate generated changelogs against an ephemeral H2 database before output |
| Rollback | AI-assisted rollback changelog generation |
| Schema inspection | Examine current database state to inform changelog creation |

**Key differentiator:** AI **never writes raw SQL or XML** — it determines which Liquibase tool to invoke with which parameters, and the tools produce the output. This architecture means generated changelogs conform to Liquibase's format constraints by construction, not by prompt engineering. The ephemeral H2 database validation step catches errors before changelogs reach production. Liquibase's enterprise positioning (compliance, audit trails, rollback) makes this appealing for regulated environments. Java 17 minimum.

**Limitation:** **Private preview** — requires registration, not generally available. Proprietary license limits customization. Requires Liquibase 5.0 (September 2025), which is a major version upgrade. XML changelog format is Liquibase-specific — teams using SQL-based migrations or other formats need Liquibase's conversion tools. The 19-tool count is high for context windows. No public GitHub repository means no community visibility, no star count, no issue tracker. Enterprise pricing unclear.

### Google MCP Toolbox for Databases — Platform-Level Database Operations

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Repository | [googleapis/genai-toolbox](https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox) |
| Stars | ~13,500 |
| Language | Go |
| License | Apache-2.0 |
| Version | v0.30.0 (March 20, 2026) |
| Transport | MCP standard |
| Creator | Google (official) |

**Key differentiator:** **Multi-database platform server** supporting PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, and Neo4j. Handles connection pooling, authentication, and schema operations across databases. Google's documentation notes it helps "cut down time spent on schema migrations." Part of the broader Google Cloud AI ecosystem. At 13.5k stars, it has the highest adoption of any server in this review — though that adoption reflects general database tooling, not migration-specific use.

**Limitation:** **Not migration-specific** — schema migrations are a side benefit, not the primary function. No migration versioning, no changelog management, no migration status tracking, no rollback support. Teams needing actual migration workflows (create migration, apply, rollback, status check) will find this insufficient. Google Cloud ecosystem alignment means best experience with Cloud SQL and AlloyDB. The migration-relevant capabilities are a subset of a much larger tool surface.

### mcp-atlas — Declarative Schema-as-Code Migrations

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Repository | [mpreziuso/mcp-atlas](https://github.com/mpreziuso/mcp-atlas) |
| Language | TypeScript |
| License | MIT |
| Transport | stdio |
| Creator | Community (solo maintainer) |

**5 tools** covering the Atlas migration workflow:

| Tool | Capability |
|------|-----------|
| migrate-apply | Execute pending migrations against the database |
| migrate-diff | Generate migration from difference between current and desired state |
| migrate-lint | Lint migrations for safety issues (destructive changes, data loss) |
| migrate-status | Check migration status and pending changes |
| migrate-validate | Validate migration directory integrity |

**Key differentiator:** The **only declarative migration MCP server**. Atlas itself (6.3k stars, by Ariga) takes the "Terraform for databases" approach — you define the desired schema state, and Atlas computes the migration to get there. This MCP server wraps all five core Atlas CLI commands. Supports 16 ORMs and HCL/SQL/ORM schema definitions. The `migrate-lint` tool is unique in the MCP migration ecosystem — it catches destructive changes before they execute. MIT license.

**Limitation:** **Solo-maintainer community project** — no indication of adoption (star count not available). Requires Atlas CLI installed separately. Atlas itself, while growing, is less established than Flyway or Liquibase. TypeScript implementation. The declarative approach is powerful but unfamiliar to teams used to imperative (sequential file) migrations. No indication of active maintenance cadence.

### drizzle-mcp — Migrations for the Fastest-Growing TypeScript ORM

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Repository | [defrex/drizzle-mcp](https://github.com/defrex/drizzle-mcp) |
| Language | TypeScript |
| License | Not specified |
| Transport | stdio |
| Creator | Community |

**Key differentiator:** **Drizzle ORM migration support** — generate and run migrations via drizzle-kit, plus schema introspection and query execution. Drizzle (28k+ stars) is the fastest-growing TypeScript ORM, and this is its only MCP interface. Supports SQLite and PostgreSQL. Works with any existing Drizzle project — just point it at your drizzle config.

**Limitation:** Community-maintained, no official Drizzle backing. SQLite and PostgreSQL only — no MySQL support despite Drizzle supporting it. License not specified in repository. Solo maintainer. Star count not prominently available. Drizzle's migration format is ORM-specific — same lock-in concern as Prisma.

### mig2schema — Migration History to Schema DDL

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Repository | [alc6/mig2schema](https://github.com/alc6/mig2schema) |
| Language | Go |
| Transport | stdio |
| Creator | Community |

**2 tools** with a focused purpose:

| Tool | Capability |
|------|-----------|
| extract_schema | Run migration history in a sandbox, produce final schema via pg_dump |
| validate_migrations | Verify migration history applies cleanly |

**Key differentiator:** Solves a specific problem — **understanding what your migration history actually produces**. Runs all migrations in a sandbox PostgreSQL instance and extracts the resulting schema as DDL. Useful for teams with long migration histories where the cumulative schema is unclear, or for validating that migrations produce the expected result.

**Limitation:** PostgreSQL-only. Two tools only. Requires a sandbox PostgreSQL instance. Niche use case — schema extraction, not migration management. Small community project.

## Also Available

### FreePeak/db-mcp-server (351 stars, Go)

Multi-database MCP server with query execution, transaction management, and schema exploration. An "AI-Assisted Migration Manager" is on the Q4 2025 roadmap but may or may not have shipped. Current capabilities are database operations, not migration-specific workflows.

### django-migrations-mcp (mrrobotke, 6 stars, Python)

Django-specific migration management for distributed environments. Framework-locked to Django's ORM and migration system. 6 stars indicates minimal adoption.

### Bytebase/dbhub (2.4k stars, Go)

Schema exploration and querying across databases — but **not migration execution**. Bytebase itself (11.6k stars) is a major database schema change platform, yet its MCP presence (dbhub) doesn't expose its schema change workflow. This is a notable gap: the tool exists, the MCP server just doesn't surface the migration features.

### Kafka Schema Registry MCP

48 tools for schema evolution and migration in event streaming contexts. Relevant for Kafka schema compatibility management (AVRO, Protobuf, JSON Schema) but not for relational database migrations.

## Notable Gaps

**No Flyway MCP server** — Flyway (10.7k GitHub stars, owned by Redgate) is the most popular Java-ecosystem migration tool and arguably the most widely used developer-oriented migration tool overall. Zero MCP presence.

**No Alembic MCP server** — The standard Python/SQLAlchemy migration tool. Every production Python application using SQLAlchemy relies on Alembic for migrations. Zero MCP presence.

**No golang-migrate MCP server** — The most popular Go migration tool (16.4k GitHub stars — more than Flyway). Zero MCP presence.

**No Sequelize, TypeORM, Knex, or MikroORM MCP servers** — The Node.js ORM ecosystem beyond Prisma and Drizzle has no migration MCP tooling whatsoever.

**No Rails migrations MCP server** — Rails invented the modern migration pattern. ActiveRecord migrations remain the standard for Ruby applications. Zero MCP presence.

**No gh-ost or pt-online-schema-change MCP server** — Online schema migration tools that handle zero-downtime production migrations. These are critical for large-scale databases where `ALTER TABLE` locks are unacceptable.

**No Bytebase migration MCP** — Bytebase (11.6k stars) has dbhub for queries but doesn't expose its schema change workflow through MCP. The migration platform exists; the MCP integration doesn't.

## Known Issues

1. **Most major migration tools have zero MCP presence** — Flyway (10.7k stars), Alembic (Python standard), golang-migrate (16.4k stars), Rails migrations (the original migration framework), Sequelize, TypeORM, Knex, and MikroORM all have no MCP servers. The tools that the majority of developers actually use for migrations are completely absent. This isn't a gap at the edges — it's a gap at the center.

2. **Liquibase's MCP is private preview — not generally available** — The most feature-rich migration MCP server (19 tools, AI-assisted changelog generation, ephemeral validation) requires registration and is not publicly downloadable. No public GitHub repository, no community visibility, no way to evaluate it without vendor approval. Private preview status means the API may change, features may be removed, and general availability timing is unclear.

3. **Prisma's MCP is ORM-locked — only works with Prisma schema format** — The most accessible migration MCP server (built into CLI, no separate install) only works if your project uses Prisma. The same applies to drizzle-mcp for Drizzle projects and django-migrations-mcp for Django projects. Each MCP server serves only its own ORM's user base, and there's no framework-agnostic migration MCP.

4. **Atlas community MCP (mpreziuso) is the only declarative migration MCP — but it's a solo-maintainer project** — The "Terraform for databases" approach (declare desired state, compute the diff) is powerful, but the MCP server wrapping it has unknown adoption and a single maintainer. Atlas itself has 6.3k stars and commercial backing from Ariga, but the MCP server is a community contribution with no official support.

5. **No online schema migration MCP (gh-ost, pt-osc)** — Production databases at scale cannot afford `ALTER TABLE` locks. Tools like GitHub's gh-ost and Percona's pt-online-schema-change handle zero-downtime migrations, but neither has an MCP server. AI agents can generate migrations but cannot execute them safely on large production databases through MCP.

6. **Migration rollback support is minimal across the ecosystem** — Liquibase's private preview includes AI-assisted rollback generation. Prisma has `migrate-reset` (full reset, not selective rollback). Atlas has no rollback tool in the MCP server. None of the community servers support targeted rollback of specific migrations. In production, rollback is often more important than forward migration.

7. **No migration CI/CD integration through MCP** — None of these MCP servers can trigger migration pipelines, run migrations in staging before production, or integrate with deployment workflows. AI agents can generate migrations locally but cannot push them through a CI/CD pipeline to production. The migration-to-deployment gap is unaddressed.

8. **ORM fragmentation means each framework needs its own MCP** — Prisma, Drizzle, Django, Rails, Sequelize, TypeORM, Knex, MikroORM, SQLAlchemy/Alembic, and GORM each have their own migration format and CLI. An MCP server for one is useless for another. Only tool-level servers (Flyway, Liquibase, Atlas, golang-migrate) are framework-agnostic — and most of those don't have MCP servers.

9. **Google MCP Toolbox is database-focused, not migration-focused** — At 13.5k stars, it's the highest-starred server in this review, but its migration relevance is incidental. Schema operations are a subset of a much larger tool surface covering connection pooling, authentication, and query execution. Teams seeking it for migrations will find it insufficient; teams seeking it for database operations will find migrations underserved.

10. **No cross-database migration support** — Each MCP server targets one ORM or tool. There's no MCP server that can manage migrations across PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server in a polyglot database environment. Even Liquibase and Atlas, which support multiple databases, have MCP servers that operate one database at a time. Multi-database migration orchestration doesn't exist in MCP.

## Bottom Line

**Rating: 2.5 out of 5**

Database migration and schema management MCP servers are in a **very early state**. The two vendor-backed options tell the story: Prisma's MCP server is genuinely useful but ORM-locked to Prisma's schema format, and Liquibase's AI Changelog Generator has the most sophisticated architecture (19 tools, ephemeral validation, AI-assisted rollback) but is stuck in private preview with no public availability. Google's MCP Toolbox for Databases (13.5k stars) provides database operations but treats migrations as a side benefit. The community contributions are promising but small — mcp-atlas wraps Atlas's declarative migrations in 5 clean tools, drizzle-mcp brings Drizzle ORM support, and mig2schema solves a niche but real schema extraction problem.

The **2.5/5 rating** reflects: a foundational developer workflow with almost no MCP coverage. The gaps are not at the edges but at the center — Flyway (10.7k stars, most popular Java migration tool), Alembic (Python standard), golang-migrate (16.4k stars, most popular Go migration tool), Rails migrations (the original migration framework), and every major Node.js ORM beyond Prisma and Drizzle are completely absent. No online schema migration tooling (gh-ost, pt-osc) exists. Rollback support is minimal. CI/CD integration is zero. ORM fragmentation means the few servers that exist each serve only a narrow user base. The 0.5 points above 2.0 come from Prisma's clean built-in integration and Liquibase's ambitious (if inaccessible) architecture. This category will matter enormously once it matures — schema migrations touch every backend developer — but today it's mostly empty shelves.

**Who benefits from database migration MCP servers today:**

- **Prisma teams** — The built-in CLI integration (v6.6.0+) is the simplest path to AI-assisted migrations. migrate-dev, migrate-status, and migrate-reset cover the core workflow. If you already use Prisma, this is free and immediate
- **Atlas adopters** — mcp-atlas provides the only declarative migration MCP server. If you're already using Atlas's "Terraform for databases" approach, this MCP server is a natural fit
- **Drizzle ORM users** — drizzle-mcp brings schema management and migration generation to the fastest-growing TypeScript ORM
- **Liquibase enterprise teams** — If you can get into the private preview, 19 tools with AI-assisted changelog generation and ephemeral validation is the most feature-rich option

**Who should wait:**

- **Flyway users** — The most popular Java migration tool has zero MCP presence. No workaround, no alternative, no timeline
- **Python/Alembic teams** — The standard Python migration tool has no MCP server. django-migrations-mcp exists but is Django-specific (6 stars)
- **Go developers** — golang-migrate (16.4k stars) has no MCP server. mig2schema is PostgreSQL-only schema extraction, not migration management
- **Rails/Ruby teams** — The framework that invented migrations has no MCP tooling for them
- **Teams needing production safety** — No online schema migration support (gh-ost, pt-osc), minimal rollback support, no CI/CD integration. AI-generated migrations without safe execution tooling is half the problem solved
