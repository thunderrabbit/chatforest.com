**At a glance:** [echelon-ai-labs/zoom-mcp](https://github.com/echelon-ai-labs/zoom-mcp) (26 stars, most-starred implementation) — Python, MIT. Community-built. Zoom has integrated MCP into AI Studio but hasn't published a standalone MCP server. Part of our **[Communication & Collaboration MCP category](/categories/communication-collaboration/)**.

Zoom MCP servers let AI agents **manage your meetings** — create and schedule meetings, retrieve transcripts and recordings, access AI Companion summaries, and search meeting history — all through natural language prompts. Zoom has not published an official standalone MCP server, but the company has **integrated MCP support into its AI Studio platform** for building custom agents within the Zoom ecosystem.

[Zoom](https://zoom.us/) was founded in 2011 in San Jose, California by **Eric Yuan**, a former VP of Engineering at Cisco Webex. Originally named Saasbee, Inc., Zoom launched its platform in January 2013 and went public on NASDAQ in April 2019 (ticker: ZM). As of early 2026: **$4.87 billion annual revenue** (fiscal year ending January 2026, +4.4% YoY), **~$22.5 billion market cap**, and approximately **7,400 employees**. Zoom became synonymous with video conferencing during the pandemic, growing from 10 million daily meeting participants in December 2019 to over 300 million in April 2020.

**Architecture note:** Community MCP servers wrap the [Zoom REST API](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/api/) (v2), exposing meeting management, recording, and transcript endpoints as MCP tools. All major implementations use **Server-to-Server OAuth** for authentication, requiring a Zoom Marketplace app with appropriate scopes.

## What It Does

Across the community ecosystem, Zoom MCP servers cover four main capability areas:

### Meeting Management

| Capability | What It Does |
|------------|-------------|
| Create meetings | Schedule new meetings with topic, time, duration, and settings |
| Update meetings | Modify existing meeting details |
| Delete meetings | Remove scheduled meetings |
| List meetings | Retrieve active and upcoming meetings |
| Get meeting details | View participant lists and meeting metadata |

### Transcripts & Recordings

| Capability | What It Does |
|------------|-------------|
| Download transcripts | Retrieve full verbatim transcripts from cloud recordings |
| Get recent transcripts | Batch-download transcripts from recent meetings |
| Search transcripts | Full-text search across downloaded transcript content |
| List recordings | Browse cloud recordings with date range filtering |
| Get recording details | Access granular recording metadata |

### AI Companion Summaries

| Capability | What It Does |
|------------|-------------|
| Get meeting summary | Access Zoom AI Companion meeting summaries |
| Action items | Retrieve AI-generated action items from meetings |
| Search meetings | Keyword-based meeting discovery |

### User & Account Management

| Capability | What It Does |
|------------|-------------|
| User info | Retrieve authenticated user profile |
| Account settings | Query account configuration |
| Zoom Rooms | Manage room systems across sites |

**Note:** Transcript and recording features **require Zoom Pro or higher** with cloud recording enabled. AI Companion summaries require the AI Companion feature to be enabled by the account admin.

## Top Implementations Compared

The ecosystem is small but covers distinct use cases. Here are the six most notable implementations:

### echelon-ai-labs/zoom-mcp — Most Popular

## Zoom's Platform MCP Support

Unlike most platforms we review, Zoom has taken a **platform-level approach** to MCP rather than publishing a standalone MCP server:

- **AI Studio:** Zoom admins can build custom AI agents in [Zoom AI Studio](https://www.zoom.com/en/products/custom-ai/) that connect to third-party tools via MCP
- **Marketplace integration:** Zoom App developers can connect their apps to remote MCP servers inside the Zoom App Marketplace
- **Tool configuration:** MCP enables plug-and-play tool configuration for custom agents, simplifying cross-app workflows
- **Data sources:** Custom agents can pull data from apps like Linear, Atlassian, Asana, and Box via MCP

This means Zoom sees MCP as a **connectivity standard for its platform**, not as something it needs to expose outward via a standalone server. For developers who want to connect AI agents *to* Zoom (rather than building *within* Zoom), the community servers above are the path.

**Key differentiator:** sweatco/zoom-mcp is the most polished — npm-published, 48 commits, AI Companion summary access, and the most recent updates (January 2026). For meeting management, Prathamesh0901 offers clean CRUD operations. For transcript archival and search, forayconsulting provides organized local storage. For broadest API coverage, mattcoatsworth wraps 10+ Zoom API categories. The most-starred (echelon-ai-labs, 26 stars) is ironically the least featured — it only exposes a single endpoint.

## Zoom Workplace Pricing

All community MCP servers require a Zoom account. Transcript and recording features require at least the Pro plan:

| Plan | Price | Meeting Duration | Participants | Cloud Storage | AI Companion |
|------|-------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Basic (Free) | $0 | 40 min | 100 | None | Limited |
| Pro | $13.33/user/mo | 30 hours | 100 | 5 GB | Included |
| Business | $18.33/user/mo | 30 hours | 300 | 10 GB | Included |
| Enterprise | Custom | 30 hours | 1,000 | Unlimited | Included |

*Prices shown with annual billing. Monthly billing is approximately 25% more.*

**Custom AI Companion add-on** (for AI Studio with MCP support): Additional cost beyond standard plans, pricing not publicly disclosed. The standalone AI Companion plan is $10/month for Basic users.

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **No official standalone MCP server** — Zoom has integrated MCP into AI Studio for building custom agents *within* the Zoom platform, but has not published a standalone MCP server for external AI agents to connect *to* Zoom. All external implementations are community-built with no Zoom endorsement or support.

2. **Small, fragmented ecosystem** — The most-starred implementation (echelon-ai-labs, 26 stars) only exposes a single API endpoint. The most fully featured (sweatco, 48 commits) has just 1 star. Total community engagement across all Zoom MCP servers is far lower than comparable platforms like Slack or GitHub.

3. **Server-to-Server OAuth complexity** — Every implementation requires creating a Server-to-Server OAuth app in the [Zoom Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/), configuring appropriate scopes, and managing credentials. This is more involved than simple API key authentication and requires understanding Zoom's permission model.

4. **Pro plan required for key features** — The most valuable MCP use cases (transcripts, recordings, AI summaries) require Zoom Pro ($13.33/month) or higher. Free-tier users can only manage basic meetings.

5. **Cloud recording dependency** — Transcript retrieval only works with cloud recordings, not local recordings. Users must have cloud recording enabled and sufficient storage in their plan.

6. **6-month history limit** — The Zoom API restricts meeting history access to approximately 6 months. Agents cannot access older meetings or transcripts through the API.

7. **Rate limiting** — Zoom enforces approximately 10 requests per second via the API. AI agents that chain multiple calls (list meetings → get transcript → search content) can hit limits quickly, especially in batch operations.

8. **No real-time meeting access** — None of the community MCP servers provide real-time meeting participation, live transcription, or in-meeting control. They only access data before and after meetings (scheduling, recordings, transcripts).

9. **Admin permissions for cross-user access** — Accessing other users' meetings and transcripts requires admin-level credentials and explicit proxy configuration. Standard user OAuth only accesses the authenticated user's own data.

## The Bottom Line

Zoom MCP servers address a practical workplace need: **letting AI agents manage your meeting lifecycle**. Schedule meetings through conversation, search past transcripts for "what did we decide about the Q2 budget?", pull AI-generated summaries and action items, and browse recordings — all without navigating Zoom's interface. For anyone drowning in meetings, the value proposition is clear.

But the ecosystem is notably underdeveloped compared to other platforms we've reviewed. The **most-starred implementation** (echelon-ai-labs, 26 stars) only exposes a single endpoint — it's more of a skeleton than a server. The **most capable implementation** (sweatco, 48 commits, AI summary access) has just 1 star, suggesting the community hasn't discovered it yet. Total stars across all Zoom MCP servers are a fraction of what comparable integrations like Slack or GitHub MCP servers attract.

Zoom's decision to integrate MCP at the **platform level** (in AI Studio) rather than publishing a standalone server is strategically interesting but unhelpful for developers who want to connect external AI agents to Zoom. If you're building within Zoom's ecosystem, their MCP support is promising. If you're connecting Claude or Cursor to your Zoom data, you're relying on community implementations with low maintainer counts and modest adoption.

**Rating: 3 / 5** — A clear and practical use case (AI-powered meeting management and transcript search) backed by a strong $4.87B platform with 300M+ daily meeting participants. Zoom's platform-level MCP support in AI Studio shows the company recognizes the protocol's value. Loses significant points for having no official standalone MCP server, a small and fragmented community ecosystem (max 26 stars, most implementations under 10), low maintainer activity (most repos have 1 contributor), Pro plan requirement for the most valuable features (transcripts, recordings, AI summaries), and the 6-month API history limit. Best suited for developers who need meeting management or transcript search and are comfortable choosing between small community projects.
