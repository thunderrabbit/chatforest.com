Part of our **[Databases MCP category](/categories/databases/)**.

**At a glance:** [GitHub](https://github.com/prisma/mcp) — 39 stars, TypeScript, Apache 2.0 license, 28 commits. Local: 7 tools, stdio transport, CLI-integrated. Remote: 10 tools, HTTP transport, OAuth auth. Official first-party from [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).

The Prisma MCP server is the **official first-party MCP integration** for [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), the most downloaded ORM for Node.js and TypeScript with ~7.8 million weekly npm downloads. Unlike most MCP servers that ship as a single package, Prisma takes a **dual-mode approach**: a local server for development workflows and a remote server for cloud infrastructure management.

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) was founded in 2016 in Berlin by [Søren Bramer Schmidt](https://github.com/sorenbs) and [Johannes Schickling](https://github.com/schickling). The company has raised $56.5M from investors including Kleiner Perkins and Amplify Partners. As of 2024: ~130 employees, ~$9.2M revenue. Prisma ORM supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, SQLite, MongoDB, and CockroachDB. In November 2025, Prisma released [v7.0.0](https://www.prisma.io/blog/announcing-prisma-orm-7-0-0) — a major rewrite that removed the Rust engine, delivering 90% smaller bundles and 3x faster queries. Alongside the ORM, Prisma now offers **Prisma Postgres**, a managed database service that the remote MCP server is built to manage.

## What It Does

The server exposes **17 MCP tools** across two modes:

### Local MCP Server (7 tools — Development Workflow)

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `migrate-status` | Checks migration state via `prisma migrate status` |
| `migrate-dev` | Creates and executes migrations with drift detection |
| `migrate-reset` | Resets your database with `prisma migrate reset --force` |
| `Prisma-Studio` | Opens Prisma Studio visual data editor |
| `Prisma-Postgres-account-status` | Checks authentication status with Prisma Console |
| `Create-Prisma-Postgres-Database` | Provisions a new Prisma Postgres database by region |
| `Prisma-Login` | Authenticates with Prisma Console |

The local server gives AI agents access to your development workflow — migration management, schema inspection, and visual data editing through Prisma Studio. It runs as a stdio process spawned by your AI client, executing Prisma CLI commands via `execa` under the hood.

### Remote MCP Server (10 tools — Infrastructure Management)

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `ListDatabasesTool` | Lists all databases in your workspace |
| `ExecuteSqlQueryTool` | Runs SQL queries directly against databases |
| `IntrospectSchemaTool` | Examines database schema structure |
| `CreateBackupTool` | Creates managed database backups |
| `ListBackupsTool` | Lists available backups by database and environment |
| `CreateRecoveryTool` | Restores a database from a backup snapshot |
| `CreateConnectionStringTool` | Generates connection strings for databases |
| `ListConnectionStringsTool` | Lists active connection strings |
| `DeleteConnectionStringTool` | Removes connection string credentials |
| `DeleteDatabaseTool` | Deletes a Prisma Postgres instance |

The remote server manages Prisma Postgres infrastructure — provisioning, backups, credentials, and direct SQL access. It runs as a cloud-hosted HTTP service at `https://mcp.prisma.io/mcp` with OAuth authentication through the Prisma Console.

## Setup & Configuration

### Local MCP Server (built into CLI)

The local server requires no separate installation — it's built into the Prisma CLI starting at v6.6.0. If you already have Prisma in your project, you already have the MCP server.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prisma": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "prisma", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Remote MCP Server

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Prisma-Remote": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.prisma.io/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or with direct URL support (newer clients):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Prisma-Remote": {
      "url": "https://mcp.prisma.io/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Supported AI Clients

One-click installation is available for VS Code and Cursor. Manual configuration works with Windsurf, Warp, Claude Desktop, Claude Code, ChatGPT, and OpenAI Agents SDK.

### Authentication

- **Local:** No authentication needed — runs in your project directory using your local Prisma setup
- **Remote:** OAuth via Prisma Console login (`platform auth login --early-access`)

## Safety Features

Prisma includes **AI safety guardrails** that detect when AI coding agents attempt destructive operations. When tools like Claude Code, Cursor, or Gemini CLI try to run data-destroying commands (like `migrate-reset`), Prisma blocks execution and requires explicit user consent via the `PRISMA_USER_CONSENT_FOR_DANGEROUS_AI_ACTION` environment variable. This is a notable design choice — most MCP servers leave safety entirely to the AI client.

## Development History

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| April 8, 2025 | Local MCP server launched in Prisma ORM v6.6.0 (early access) |
| June 18, 2025 | Remote MCP server launched with ORM v6.10.0 |
| November 19, 2025 | Prisma 7.0.0 released (Rust-free rewrite, MCP server continues) |
| Ongoing | 28 commits in prisma/mcp repository, 39 GitHub stars |

The MCP server was initially launched as `--early-access` and has since been integrated as a standard Prisma CLI command. The repository at [prisma/mcp](https://github.com/prisma/mcp) is relatively small (28 commits) because the local server logic lives primarily within the main [prisma/prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) monorepo (45,500+ stars).

## Pricing Impact

The MCP server itself is free. However, the **remote server only works with Prisma Postgres**, a managed database service:

| Plan | Price | Operations/mo | Storage | Databases |
|------|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| **Free** | $0 | 100,000 | 500 MB | 5 |
| **Starter** | $10/mo | 1,000,000 | 10 GB | 10 |
| **Pro** | $49/mo | 10,000,000 | 50 GB | 100 |
| **Business** | $129/mo | 50,000,000 | 100 GB | 1,000 |

An "operation" is any CRUD action against the database, counted uniformly regardless of complexity. Overages: $0.008–$0.001 per 1,000 operations depending on tier, $1–$2/GB for storage.

The **local server works with any database** Prisma supports (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, etc.) — no Prisma Postgres subscription required. This is the mode most developers will use.

## Comparison with Alternatives

| Feature | Prisma MCP | Supabase MCP | Drizzle MCP (community) | Neon MCP |
|---------|-----------|-------------|------------------------|---------|
| **Official** | Yes (first-party) | Yes (first-party) | No (community) | Yes (first-party) |
| **Tools** | 17 (7 local + 10 remote) | 20+ | ~5 | ~10 |
| **Transport** | stdio + HTTP | stdio | stdio | stdio |
| **Database** | Any (local) / Prisma Postgres (remote) | Supabase Postgres | SQLite, PostgreSQL | Neon Postgres |
| **Migration support** | Yes (full Prisma Migrate) | Yes (via SQL) | Yes (drizzle-kit) | Limited |
| **Visual editor** | Prisma Studio | Supabase Dashboard | Drizzle Studio | Neon Console |
| **Safety guardrails** | Built-in (env var consent) | None documented | None | None |
| **Free tier** | Unlimited (local) / 100K ops (remote) | 500 MB, 50K MAUs | N/A (self-hosted) | 0.5 GiB storage |
| **License** | Apache 2.0 | Apache 2.0 | MIT | Apache 2.0 |

**Prisma MCP vs Supabase MCP:** These serve different audiences. Prisma MCP is for developers using Prisma ORM in their codebase — it helps with migrations, schema management, and the development workflow. Supabase MCP is for managing a Supabase project — tables, auth, storage, edge functions. If you use Prisma with a Supabase database, you could use both.

**Prisma MCP vs Drizzle MCP:** Drizzle doesn't have an official MCP server. The community [drizzle-mcp](https://github.com/defrex/drizzle-mcp) by defrex covers basic operations but lacks official backing. Prisma's CLI integration gives it a significant reliability advantage.

## Known Issues

1. **Connection closure delay** — The local MCP server [takes 10–12 seconds to close connections](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/28039) after responding, causing blocking in some MCP clients
2. **Remote server locked to Prisma Postgres** — The 10 remote tools only work with Prisma's managed database; no support for self-hosted PostgreSQL or other databases
3. **Small standalone repository** — prisma/mcp has only 39 stars and 28 commits; most development happens in the main monorepo, making it harder to track MCP-specific changes
4. **No query execution in local mode** — The local server handles migrations and studio, but doesn't expose raw SQL execution; that's only available in remote mode
5. **Early access origins** — Originally launched as `--early-access`, and some documentation still references this flag
6. **No schema editing tools** — The local server can check migration status and run migrations, but can't directly modify Prisma schema files
7. **Remote requires mcp-remote proxy** — Clients without native HTTP MCP support need the `mcp-remote` npm package as a stdio-to-HTTP bridge
8. **Limited community adoption** — 39 GitHub stars for the MCP repo suggests low independent adoption compared to Prisma ORM's 45,500+ stars

## The Bottom Line

**Rating: 4 out of 5**

The Prisma MCP server earns its rating through **official first-party support from the most popular Node.js ORM**, a thoughtful **dual-mode architecture** that separates development workflow from infrastructure management, and **built-in safety guardrails** that no competitor matches. The local server being integrated directly into the Prisma CLI (zero extra install) is the kind of frictionless developer experience that drives adoption.

It loses a point for the **remote server being locked to Prisma Postgres** (limiting its usefulness for developers using other hosting), the **connection closure delay** that can frustrate interactive use, and the **absence of raw SQL execution in local mode**. The dual architecture also means developers need to understand which mode they need — it's not a single unified tool.

For Prisma ORM users, this is a no-brainer — you already have it installed. For developers choosing between database MCP servers, the local mode's migration management and safety guardrails make it the strongest ORM-focused option available, while Supabase MCP remains better for full-stack platform management.
