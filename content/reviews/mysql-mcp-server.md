**At a glance:** MySQL has a **solid community-driven MCP ecosystem** — but no official server from Oracle. The two leading MySQL-specific servers are [benborla/mcp-server-mysql](https://github.com/benborla/mcp-server-mysql) (1.4k stars, TypeScript, MIT) with SSH tunnel support and Claude Code integration, and [designcomputer/mysql_mcp_server](https://github.com/designcomputer/mysql_mcp_server) (1.2k stars, Python, MIT) focused on simplicity and security. Multi-database servers [Bytebase DBHub](https://github.com/bytebase/dbhub) (2.4k stars) and [Google's MCP Toolbox](https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox) (13.5k stars) also support MySQL alongside other databases. Cloud vendors AWS, Azure, and Google all provide MySQL MCP support through their platform servers. Part of our **[Databases MCP category](/categories/databases/)**.

MySQL is the **world's most popular open-source relational database** — powering roughly **39% of the relational database market** with over 235,000 companies using it worldwide. Created in 1995 by Michael "Monty" Widenius, David Axmark, and Allan Larsson as MySQL AB, it was acquired by Sun Microsystems for $1 billion in 2008, then passed to Oracle when Oracle acquired Sun for $5.6 billion in 2010. The latest Innovation release is **MySQL 9.6** (January 2026); the current Long-Term Support release is **MySQL 8.4.5**. MySQL 8.0 reaches end-of-life in **April 2026**.

**Architecture note:** Like PostgreSQL, MySQL has no single "official" MCP server from its corporate steward (Oracle). Unlike PostgreSQL, MySQL's ecosystem is smaller — roughly half the number of dedicated servers. The dominant open-source alternative MariaDB (forked from MySQL in 2009 by Widenius himself) has its own [official MCP server](https://github.com/MariaDB/mcp) (151 stars), making MariaDB the only MySQL-compatible database with a first-party MCP implementation.

The archived reference implementations focused on PostgreSQL and SQLite. MySQL's MCP ecosystem grew entirely from community effort.

## MySQL Background

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Origin | MySQL AB, Sweden (1995), by Michael Widenius, David Axmark, Allan Larsson |
| Ownership | Oracle Corporation (via Sun Microsystems acquisition, 2010) |
| Latest Innovation release | MySQL 9.6.0 (January 2026) |
| Latest LTS release | MySQL 8.4.5 |
| End-of-life: MySQL 8.0 | April 2026 |
| License | GPL v2 (Community Edition) / Commercial (Enterprise Edition) |
| Market share | 39.3% of relational databases ([6sense](https://6sense.com/tech/relational-databases/mysql-market-share)) |
| Companies using MySQL | 235,000+ worldwide |
| Top users | Facebook, YouTube, Twitter/X, WordPress, Uber, Netflix, Airbnb, Shopify |
| Cloud Database MySQL market | ~$15 billion (2025), ~15% CAGR through 2033 |
| Fork | MariaDB (forked 2009 by Widenius after Oracle acquisition) |

MySQL's dual licensing (open-source GPL + commercial Enterprise Edition) and Oracle's stewardship have driven some users toward PostgreSQL or MariaDB, but MySQL remains the default database for web applications — particularly in the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python) that powers a massive share of the internet.

## Database MCP Ecosystem Comparison

| Feature | MySQL (this review) | PostgreSQL |
|---------|-------------------|------------|
| Dedicated MCP servers | ~6 | ~10+ |
| Top server stars | 1.4k (benborla) | 2.4k (Postgres MCP Pro) |
| Multi-DB servers with support | DBHub (2.4k), Google (13.5k), MCP Alchemy (397) | DBHub (2.4k), Google (13.5k) |
| Official vendor MCP server | None (Oracle) | None (community-governed) |
| MariaDB/fork server | MariaDB/mcp (151 stars, official) | N/A |
| Cloud vendor support | AWS, Azure, Google | AWS, Azure, Google |
| Performance analysis tools | Limited | Postgres MCP Pro (index tuning, health) |
| Vector search support | askdba (MySQL 9.0+), MariaDB MCP | Limited (pgvector not well-supported) |
| Read-only default | Yes (most servers) | Varies |
| Rating | **3.5/5** | **4.5/5** |

## Known Issues

1. **No Oracle-official MCP server** — Despite owning MySQL, Oracle has not released an MCP server for MySQL Community or Enterprise Edition. The ecosystem is entirely community-driven, which means no guaranteed long-term support from MySQL's corporate steward.

2. **Smaller ecosystem than PostgreSQL** — MySQL has roughly half the number of dedicated MCP servers compared to PostgreSQL. While the top servers are solid, there's less choice for specialized use cases (monitoring, performance tuning, extension management).

3. **No performance analysis tools** — Unlike PostgreSQL's Postgres MCP Pro with its index tuning and workload analysis, no MySQL MCP server provides deep performance optimization capabilities. MySQL administrators get schema browsing and query execution, not DBA-grade performance tooling.

4. **MySQL 8.0 end-of-life approaching** — MySQL 8.0 reaches EOL in April 2026. Many MCP servers haven't documented compatibility with MySQL 9.x Innovation releases or the 8.4 LTS track. Users on older versions may face compatibility gaps.

5. **Oracle's dual licensing creates confusion** — MySQL's GPL v2 license means MCP servers using MySQL client libraries must navigate GPL compatibility. Some servers choose MIT/Apache licenses for their own code while depending on GPL MySQL connectors — the legal implications aren't always clear.

6. **MariaDB compatibility is inconsistent** — Some MySQL MCP servers work with MariaDB (askdba explicitly supports it), but most don't document MariaDB compatibility. Given that many organizations have migrated from MySQL to MariaDB, this is a gap.

7. **Write-access security risks** — benborla/mcp-server-mysql allows enabling write operations via config flag. Without careful permission management, an AI agent could execute destructive DDL or DML against production databases. Read-only should remain the default.

8. **SSH tunnel complexity** — While benborla's SSH tunnel support is a feature, it adds configuration complexity and potential failure modes. Remote database access through MCP introduces security considerations that local-only servers avoid.

9. **neverinfamous/mysql-mcp claims 192 tools but has 3 stars** — The most feature-rich MySQL MCP server (192 tools, 25 groups, 2,169 tests) has almost no community adoption. Feature count alone doesn't indicate reliability or real-world usage.

10. **Cloud vendor servers create lock-in** — AWS, Azure, and Google each provide MySQL MCP support, but only for their managed MySQL services. Migrating between clouds means switching MCP servers and reconfiguring AI integrations.

## Bottom Line

**Rating: 3.5 out of 5**

MySQL has a **respectable MCP ecosystem** that covers the basics well — schema exploration, SQL execution, and multi-database support — but lacks the depth and specialization found in PostgreSQL's MCP landscape.

**benborla/mcp-server-mysql** (1.4k stars) is the clear leader for MySQL-specific needs, with SSH tunneling, Claude Code integration, connection pooling, and active development across 222 commits. **designcomputer/mysql_mcp_server** (1.2k stars) offers a simpler alternative for developers who want minimal configuration. **Bytebase DBHub** (2.4k stars) is the best multi-database option, providing token-efficient MySQL support alongside PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, and SQLite.

The **3.5/5 rating** reflects solid fundamentals with clear gaps. Two 1k+ star dedicated servers, strong multi-database support from DBHub and Google Toolbox, and full cloud vendor coverage (AWS, Azure, Google) earn MySQL a good score. It loses a full point compared to PostgreSQL for: no Oracle-official server, no performance analysis/tuning tools (PostgreSQL has Postgres MCP Pro), roughly half the number of dedicated servers, and no deep MySQL-specific capabilities like slow query log analysis, InnoDB buffer pool monitoring, or replication status checks.

**Who benefits most from MySQL's MCP ecosystem:**

- **Web application developers** — MySQL powers most LAMP/LEMP stacks; benborla's server lets AI assistants explore schemas and write queries in context
- **Multi-database teams** — DBHub and Google Toolbox provide MySQL support alongside other databases from a single MCP server
- **Cloud users** — AWS, Azure, and Google all provide managed MySQL MCP servers integrated with their platforms
- **Claude Code users** — benborla/mcp-server-mysql's SSH tunnel hooks and auto-management are specifically designed for Claude Code workflows

**Who should be cautious:**

- **DBAs seeking performance tools** — if you need AI-assisted query optimization, index tuning, or health monitoring, PostgreSQL's Postgres MCP Pro is significantly ahead
- **MySQL Enterprise Edition users** — no MCP server integrates with Oracle's Enterprise features (Enterprise Monitor, Query Analyzer, Firewall)
- **MariaDB users** — while some MySQL MCP servers work with MariaDB, consider the [official MariaDB MCP server](https://github.com/MariaDB/mcp) (151 stars) with its vector search and SSE/HTTP transport support
