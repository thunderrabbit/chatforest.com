Part of our **[Databases MCP category](/categories/databases/)**.

**At a glance:** 81,600+ GitHub stars (monorepo), ~45,000 weekly npm downloads, v2026.1.26 (last release January 2026), 9 tools, actively maintained, ~61.2K weekly PulseMCP visitors (#21 globally, ~2M all-time)

The Memory MCP server (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory`) is Anthropic's official solution for giving AI agents persistent memory across conversations. It maintains a local knowledge graph — entities, relations, and observations stored as JSONL — that agents can read and update over time. The idea is simple: your agent remembers who you are, what you're working on, and what you've told it before.

It's one of the most popular MCP servers, pulling ~45,000 weekly npm downloads and ranking #21 globally on PulseMCP with over 2 million estimated all-time visitors. Unlike the archived SQLite and PostgreSQL reference servers, Memory is still actively maintained in the main `servers` repository. And the core concept works — agents that remember context are genuinely more useful than ones that start fresh every session.

But the landscape has shifted. In March 2026, OWASP published its MCP Top 10, and "context over-sharing" — exactly what `read_graph` does — is now a recognized security risk category. Meanwhile, alternatives like Graphiti (24,000 stars), mem0, and Letta have matured rapidly. The Memory server still works for small personal use cases, but the gap between it and production-ready alternatives has widened significantly.

## What It Does

The server exposes nine tools organized around three concepts:

**Entities** — the nodes in your knowledge graph:
- **`create_entities`** — Create one or more entities with a name, type, and initial observations. Types are freestrings like "person", "project", or "concept" — there's no enforced schema.
- **`delete_entities`** — Remove entities and all their connected relations.

**Relations** — directed edges between entities:
- **`create_relations`** — Define connections like "Alice works_on ProjectX" or "React depends_on Node". Stored in active voice by convention.
- **`delete_relations`** — Remove specific connections.

**Observations** — facts attached to entities:
- **`add_observations`** — Append new facts to existing entities. Each observation is a string — "Prefers dark mode", "Located in Tokyo", "Uses Python 3.11".
- **`delete_observations`** — Remove specific observations from an entity.

**Retrieval:**
- **`read_graph`** — Dump the entire knowledge graph. Every entity, every relation, every observation. All of it.
- **`search_nodes`** — Query entities by matching against names, types, and observation text.
- **`open_nodes`** — Retrieve specific entities by name, including their relations to other entities in the result set.

Storage is a single JSONL file (default: `memory.jsonl`), configurable via the `MEMORY_FILE_PATH` environment variable. No database, no index files, no external dependencies.

## Setup

For Claude Desktop, add this to your config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    }
  }
}
```

Docker with persistent storage:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm",
        "-v", "claude-memory:/app/dist",
        "mcp/memory"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Custom memory file path:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_FILE_PATH": "/path/to/my-memory.jsonl"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Requirements: Node.js 18+ and npm. That's it. No API keys, no accounts, no configuration beyond the optional file path.

**Setup difficulty: Very easy.** One line in your MCP config. The Docker approach needs a named volume for persistence (otherwise your memories disappear when the container stops), but that's standard Docker practice.

## What's New (March 2026 Update)

**OWASP MCP Top 10 flags context over-sharing.** In March 2026, OWASP published the MCP Top 10 security framework, and one of the recognized risk categories is "context over-sharing" — when context windows are shared, persistent, or insufficiently scoped, sensitive information from one task or user can leak to another. The Memory server's `read_graph` tool, which dumps the entire knowledge graph into the conversation context, is a textbook example. This isn't a vulnerability in the traditional sense — it's a design pattern the security community has formally identified as risky. OWASP's recommended mitigations include isolated context windows per user and per task, context expiration policies, and access controls on context retrieval — none of which the Memory server implements.

**No new releases since January 2026.** The last published version is v2026.1.26, released in January 2026. The server hasn't received any feature updates, new tools, or architectural changes since the original review. The `servers` monorepo (81,600+ stars) remains active, but the Memory server specifically has seen minimal changes.

**Default memory file path fix.** A community contribution (PR #2160) changed the default memory file location from the npm installation directory (which could be a transient npx cache path like `/home/user/.npm/_npx/.../memory.json`) to the current working directory. This addressed a persistent user complaint: memories silently written to temporary directories that would disappear. If you're using `MEMORY_FILE_PATH`, this change doesn't affect you.

**VS Code integration added.** The README now includes one-click installation buttons for VS Code and VS Code Insiders, alongside the existing Claude Desktop and Docker configuration examples.

**Docker upgrade note.** Users upgrading Docker containers now need to delete legacy `index.js` files from prior volumes before upgrading — a minor but potentially confusing breaking change.

**Alternatives landscape has exploded.** The agent memory space has matured dramatically since the original review:
- **Graphiti/Zep** has grown to ~24,100 GitHub stars and released MCP Server 1.0. Zep has repositioned as a "context engineering platform" with temporal knowledge graphs, automatic entity extraction, and multi-database support (FalkorDB, Neo4j, Kuzu, Neptune).
- **mem0** has grown significantly but paywalled graph features at $249/month (Pro tier). The free/starter tiers provide vector search only. The open-source OpenMemory option (Docker + Postgres + Qdrant) remains available for self-hosting.
- **Letta** (formerly MemGPT) has emerged as a full agent runtime where agents actively manage their own memory using an OS-inspired tiered architecture — core memory, archival memory, and recall memory. A high-performance Rust-based MCP server provides 7 consolidated tools covering 103 operations.
- **Hindsight** is a newer entrant offering all four retrieval strategies (vector, graph, temporal, keyword) at every tier including the free self-hosted option — more retrieval depth than mem0 Pro without the price.

**PulseMCP traffic remains strong.** The Memory server draws ~61,200 weekly visitors on PulseMCP with ~2 million estimated all-time visitors, ranking #21 globally. That makes it one of the most-visited MCP server pages, reflecting genuine user interest in the agent memory problem — even if many visitors ultimately choose alternatives.

## What Works Well

**The entity-relation-observation model is intuitive.** It maps naturally to how people think about memory: things (entities), how they connect (relations), and what we know about them (observations). Agents pick this up without much prompting — they naturally create entities for people, projects, and concepts they encounter, then link them together. No schema design required.

**Persistence across conversations is genuinely useful.** The killer feature is simple: your agent remembers your name, your preferences, your current projects, and what you discussed last week. This transforms the experience from "explaining everything every time" to "picking up where we left off." For personal assistant use cases, this alone justifies the server.

**The JSONL format is inspectable and portable.** Your memories are stored in a plain text file you can read, edit, grep through, or back up. No proprietary database, no cloud sync, no lock-in. If you want to see exactly what your agent has stored about you, open the file. If you want to delete something, edit the file. This transparency matters.

**Search works well for targeted retrieval.** The `search_nodes` tool matches against entity names, types, and observation text. For queries like "what do I know about ProjectX?" or "find all people entities," it returns focused results — typically 200-500 tokens instead of dumping the whole graph. This is the right way to access memory in most cases.

**Still maintained, not archived.** Unlike the archived SQLite and Postgres MCP servers, Memory lives in the main `modelcontextprotocol/servers` repository. Version 2026.1.26 is current, though it hasn't seen a release since January 2026. The server is stable but not actively evolving — no new tools, no architectural improvements, no response to the OWASP context over-sharing concerns.

## What Doesn't Work Well

**`read_graph` is a context bomb — and now an OWASP-recognized risk.** This tool dumps your entire knowledge graph into the conversation context. For a small personal graph (50-100 entities), that's manageable — maybe 2,000-3,000 tokens. But knowledge graphs grow fast. Users with months of accumulated memory report 14,000+ token dumps from a single `read_graph` call. That's a significant chunk of your context window consumed by memory retrieval, leaving less room for the actual conversation. The recommended workaround — starting each chat with "Remembering..." to trigger a full graph load — makes this worse by front-loading the context cost. As of March 2026, the OWASP MCP Top 10 formally identifies "context over-sharing" as a security risk category. The `read_graph` pattern — dumping unscoped, persistent context into shared sessions — is exactly what OWASP warns about.

**No memory isolation between projects or contexts.** All entities live in one flat graph. If you use the same Memory server for work projects and personal notes, your agent sees everything mixed together. Community benchmarks found that the system "couldn't separate the contexts of two projects," confusing memories when similar projects existed. It works for single-context use; it falls apart when you need boundaries.

**No deduplication or conflict resolution.** Create the same entity twice? You get two entities. Add contradictory observations ("Prefers tabs" and "Prefers spaces")? Both persist. The server doesn't merge, deduplicate, or flag conflicts — that burden falls entirely on the agent, which may or may not handle it well depending on the model and prompt.

**JSONL doesn't scale.** Every read operation loads the entire file. Every write operation rewrites it. With hundreds of entities, this is fine. With thousands, you'll notice latency. There's no indexing, no partial reads, no pagination. The storage format that makes the server simple also makes it slow at scale.

**No semantic search.** `search_nodes` does string matching — it finds "Python" in observations but won't connect "snake_case" to Python conventions. For a knowledge graph, the lack of embedding-based or semantic retrieval is a significant gap. You can only find what you can match textually.

**No access controls or encryption.** The JSONL file is plaintext on disk. Anyone with file access can read everything your agent has memorized about you. For a personal tool on your own machine, this is probably fine. For any shared or team environment, it's a non-starter.

## Compared to Alternatives

**vs. Zep/Graphiti (24,000 GitHub stars, MCP Server 1.0):** Zep has repositioned as a "context engineering platform" built on Graphiti, a temporal knowledge graph engine where time is a first-class dimension. Automatic entity extraction, relationship inference, multi-database support (FalkorDB, Neo4j, Kuzu, Neptune), and multi-LLM provider compatibility. The gap has widened since the original review — Graphiti now has MCP Server 1.0, 24K stars, and a $25/month Flex tier that gives full access without feature gating. The clear winner for anything beyond personal use. See our [Zep/Graphiti review](/reviews/zep-graphiti-mcp-server/).

**vs. mem0 (MemZero):** A managed memory layer using dual-store architecture: vector database for semantic search and knowledge graph for entity relationships. Graph features are now paywalled at $249/month (Pro tier) — the free and $19/month Standard tiers give vector search only. The open-source OpenMemory option (Docker + Postgres + Qdrant) remains available for self-hosting. Better retrieval quality than the official Memory server, but the pricing structure means the most interesting features require significant investment. See our [mem0 review](/reviews/mem0-mcp-server/).

**vs. Letta (formerly MemGPT):** A full agent runtime where agents actively manage their own memory using an OS-inspired tiered architecture — core memory, archival memory, and recall memory. A high-performance Rust-based MCP server provides 7 consolidated tools covering 103 operations with 68-96% response size reduction. A fundamentally different approach: instead of a memory *tool*, Letta is a memory *platform*. Overkill for personal assistant memory; worth considering for agentic workflows.

**vs. Hindsight:** A newer entrant offering all four retrieval strategies — vector, graph, temporal, and keyword — at every tier, including the free self-hosted option. Provides more retrieval depth than mem0 Pro without the price jump, plus Python, TypeScript, and Go SDKs with MCP-first integration. Worth evaluating if you want graph + temporal memory without Zep's infrastructure requirements.

**vs. Chroma MCP Server:** Vector database-backed retrieval with full-text search, metadata filtering, and multiple embedding functions (Cohere, OpenAI, Jina, Voyage). Different paradigm — more document retrieval than knowledge graph. Better for finding relevant context from a large corpus; less structured than entity-relation approaches.

**vs. Basic Memory:** Focuses on note-taking and document memory rather than entity-relation graphs. Stores memories as Markdown files, which integrate naturally with tools like Obsidian. If your "memory" is more like notes than a graph of entities, Basic Memory may fit better.

**vs. Our [SQLite MCP Server review](/reviews/sqlite-mcp-server/):** Both are official Anthropic reference implementations. Memory is actively maintained (SQLite is archived with a SQL injection vulnerability). Memory is more specialized (knowledge graph vs. general database). But both share the same limitation: simple design that works for demos and personal use but doesn't scale to production needs.

## Who Should Use This

**Yes, use it if:**
- You want your personal AI assistant to remember your name, preferences, and ongoing projects across conversations
- Your knowledge graph will stay small (under a few hundred entities)
- You use a single context (one project, one domain) per Memory server instance
- You value transparency and want to inspect/edit your memories in a plain text file
- You want something that works in 30 seconds with zero configuration

**Don't use it if:**
- You need memory across multiple projects or domains (no isolation)
- Your memory corpus will grow to thousands of entities (JSONL doesn't scale)
- You need semantic search (embedding-based retrieval)
- You need team or multi-user memory (no access controls)
- You need time-aware recall ("what did I discuss last Tuesday?")
- You need guaranteed consistency (no deduplication or conflict resolution)

{{< verdict rating="3.5" summary="The right idea, but the market has moved on" >}}
The Memory MCP server still solves a real problem — agents that remember are dramatically more useful than agents that don't. The entity-relation-observation model is intuitive, the JSONL storage is transparent and portable, and setup takes 30 seconds. For personal use with a small knowledge graph in a single context, it works and it's not archived. But the world around it has changed. The OWASP MCP Top 10 now formally identifies context over-sharing as a security risk — and `read_graph` is a textbook example. Graphiti has hit 24,000 stars and shipped MCP Server 1.0. Letta offers a full agent memory runtime. Even mem0's free self-hosted tier does semantic search. The Memory server remains the right choice if you want the simplest possible persistent memory with zero configuration — but that niche is shrinking fast. If you're starting a new project in March 2026, start with Zep/Graphiti (for temporal graphs), Hindsight (for multi-strategy retrieval), or Letta (for agent-managed memory). The official server proved the concept; the ecosystem has built the production-ready implementations.
