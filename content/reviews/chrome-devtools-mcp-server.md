Most MCP servers for browsers are automation tools — they click buttons, fill forms, and navigate pages. The [Chrome DevTools MCP server](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp) does that too, but its real value is what happens after: performance tracing with Core Web Vitals, memory heap snapshots for leak detection, Lighthouse audits, network request inspection, and console message retrieval with source-mapped stack traces.

Built and maintained by the Chrome DevTools team at Google (the same people behind Chrome DevTools and Puppeteer), this server gives AI coding agents the kind of deep browser insight that previously required a human developer staring at the DevTools panel. The key differentiator is the shift from "what happened" to "why it happened" — your agent doesn't just report that a page loaded slowly, it can trace the performance bottleneck to a specific long task or layout shift.

**Category:** [Developer Tools](/categories/developer-tools/)

## What It Does

The server exposes 29 tools across seven categories:

### Input Automation (9 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `click` | Click an element, with optional double-click |
| `drag` | Drag one element onto another |
| `fill` | Type into inputs/textareas or select from dropdowns |
| `fill_form` | Fill multiple form elements at once |
| `handle_dialog` | Accept or dismiss browser dialogs |
| `hover` | Hover over an element |
| `press_key` | Press a key or key combination |
| `type_text` | Type text into the currently focused input |
| `upload_file` | Upload a file through a file input element |

### Navigation (6 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `close_page` | Close a page by index |
| `list_pages` | List all open pages |
| `navigate_page` | Go to a URL, go back, forward, or reload |
| `new_page` | Open a new tab and load a URL |
| `select_page` | Select a page as context for future calls |
| `wait_for` | Wait for text to appear on the page |

### Emulation (2 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `emulate` | Emulate color scheme, CPU throttling, geolocation, network conditions, user agent, viewport |
| `resize_page` | Resize page window dimensions |

### Performance (4 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `performance_start_trace` | Start a performance trace for Core Web Vitals |
| `performance_stop_trace` | Stop the trace and get results |
| `performance_analyze_insight` | Get detailed analysis of a specific Performance Insight |
| `take_memory_snapshot` | Capture a heap snapshot for memory leak debugging |

### Network (2 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_network_requests` | List all requests since last navigation |
| `get_network_request` | Get full details of a specific request by ID |

### Debugging (6 tools)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `evaluate_script` | Run JavaScript in the page context, returns JSON |
| `list_console_messages` | List all console messages since last navigation |
| `get_console_message` | Get a specific console message by ID |
| `lighthouse_audit` | Run Lighthouse for accessibility, SEO, and best practices |
| `take_screenshot` | Screenshot the full page or a specific element |
| `take_snapshot` | Accessibility-tree-based text snapshot with unique element UIDs |

The performance tools are where this server separates itself from every other browser MCP server. A performance trace can generate 30 MB of raw data — the server condenses that into approximately 4 KB of AI-consumable summaries, pulling out Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, TBT) and actionable insights. The agent can then drill into specific insights with `performance_analyze_insight` for root cause analysis.

## Slim Mode

For simpler tasks where 29 tools would waste context budget, the `--slim` flag reduces the server to just three tools: `navigate`, `evaluate`, and `screenshot`. This drops the token cost from ~18K to a fraction of that. If you only need an agent to check a page visually or run a quick JS evaluation, slim mode is the way to go.

## Setup

### Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chrome-devtools": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "chrome-devtools-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add chrome-devtools --scope user npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest
```

### Cursor / VS Code

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` or VS Code MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chrome-devtools": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "chrome-devtools-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Requirements:** Node.js v20.19+ (LTS) and Chrome stable or newer.

The server does not launch Chrome at startup — it starts a browser instance on the first tool call. By default, it creates a new Chrome profile for each session.

### Connecting to an Existing Browser

This is the killer feature for debugging. Three options:

1. **`--autoConnect`** — Auto-detect a locally running Chrome 144+ instance. Chrome will show a permission dialog asking if you want to allow the connection.

2. **`--browserUrl http://127.0.0.1:9222`** — Connect to Chrome launched with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`.

3. **`--wsEndpoint ws://...`** — Direct WebSocket connection to a Chrome DevTools Protocol endpoint.

Connecting to your actual browsing session means the agent can inspect the page you're looking at, read console errors, analyze performance, and help you debug in real time — without launching a separate browser.

### Useful Flags

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--headless` | Run without UI |
| `--slim` | Only 3 basic tools (saves tokens) |
| `--isolated` | Temporary user-data-dir with auto-cleanup |
| `--channel canary\|beta\|dev` | Choose Chrome channel |
| `--viewport 1280x720` | Set initial viewport size |
| `--no-performance-crux` | Disable CrUX API calls (otherwise URLs are sent to Google) |

## How It Compares to Playwright and Puppeteer MCP

This is the question everyone asks, and the answer is: they solve different problems.

**Playwright MCP** (21 tools) is a cross-browser automation server. It works with Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, targets elements via the accessibility tree, and is designed for end-to-end testing workflows. It tells you "what happened" from the user's perspective.

**Puppeteer MCP** (7 tools) is simpler automation — Chrome-only, CSS-selector targeting, lighter weight.

**Chrome DevTools MCP** (29 tools) is a browser debugging and inspection server that also handles automation. It tells you "why something happened" from the browser engine's perspective. Capabilities that neither Playwright nor Puppeteer MCP offer:

- **Performance tracing** with Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, TBT) and insight-level analysis
- **Memory heap snapshots** for detecting and diagnosing memory leaks
- **Lighthouse audits** for accessibility, SEO, and best practices scoring
- **Network request inspection** with full request/response details
- **Console message retrieval** with source-mapped stack traces
- **CPU and network throttling emulation** for testing under constrained conditions
- **CrUX field data integration** for real-world performance comparison

If you need cross-browser testing: Playwright MCP. If you need to understand why your page has a 4-second LCP or where a memory leak is hiding: Chrome DevTools MCP. Many teams will benefit from running both.

## What's Good

**The performance tooling is genuinely new territory for MCP.** No other browser MCP server offers Core Web Vitals tracing, heap snapshots, or Lighthouse audits. Having an AI agent identify that your CLS is caused by a late-loading image or that your LCP is blocked by a render-blocking script — and do it in natural language — is a real workflow improvement. The 30 MB trace → 4 KB summary compression is well-engineered.

**Connecting to your actual browser session changes the debugging loop.** Instead of describing a bug to your AI assistant, you connect it to the page where the bug is happening. The agent can read console errors, inspect network requests, check accessibility, and analyze performance — all from your live session. The `--autoConnect` flag on Chrome 144+ makes this nearly frictionless.

**The team behind it matters.** This is maintained by the same people who build Chrome DevTools and Puppeteer — Nikolay Vitkov (268 commits, also a Puppeteer maintainer), Alex Rudenko, Sebastian Benz, Jack Franklin, and Mathias Bynens. They understand the Chrome DevTools Protocol better than anyone. With 67 contributors and multiple releases per week, the maintenance velocity is among the highest of any MCP server we've reviewed.

**Slim mode is a smart escape hatch.** The full 29-tool suite costs ~18K tokens in context just for definitions. Slim mode drops to 3 tools — `navigate`, `evaluate`, and `screenshot` — for tasks where you don't need the debugging depth. This shows awareness of a real LLM constraint that many MCP server authors ignore.

**330K weekly npm downloads.** This is one of the most widely adopted MCP servers in the ecosystem. The scale of real-world testing and feedback that comes with that adoption means bugs get found and fixed fast.

## What's Not

**Token consumption is significant.** At ~18K tokens for tool definitions alone, this server takes a meaningful bite out of your agent's context window before any work begins. Every tool costs tokens whether you use it or not. The slim mode helps, but it's all-or-nothing — there's no way to load, say, just the performance and debugging tools without the input automation tools.

**Security surface area is real.** When connected to your browser session, the MCP server has access to everything the browser can see — authenticated sessions, cookies, page content. A prompt injection on any page the agent visits could potentially escalate to accessing data in other open tabs. The Chrome team has added the permission dialog for `--autoConnect`, but the fundamental risk of giving an AI agent browser-level access remains.

**Usage telemetry is on by default.** The server sends usage statistics to Google unless you set `CHROME_DEVTOOLS_MCP_NO_USAGE_STATISTICS=1` or are running in a CI environment. This is disclosed in the documentation, but opt-out telemetry is always worth flagging.

**Memory leak in autoConnect mode.** GitHub issue #1192 reports memory growth of ~13 MB/minute when using autoConnect, caused by the PageCollector not cleaning up stale entries. This can cause out-of-memory crashes in long-running sessions. Not yet fixed as of v0.20.3.

**No granular tool loading.** You get either all 29 tools or slim mode's 3. There's no middle ground — you can't load just the performance category or just the debugging tools. Category flags exist (`--categoryPerformance`, `--categoryNetwork`) but they toggle categories on/off rather than offering selective loading.

**CrUX data sends URLs to Google.** The performance tools query Google's Chrome UX Report (CrUX) API by default, which means URLs you're testing are sent to Google's servers. Disable with `--no-performance-crux` if this is a concern for internal or pre-release URLs.

## Who's It For

**Frontend developers debugging performance issues.** If you're chasing Core Web Vitals scores, investigating layout shifts, or hunting memory leaks, connecting your AI agent to Chrome DevTools is the most direct path to answers. The agent can trace, analyze, and explain performance bottlenecks in a single conversation.

**Teams doing accessibility and SEO audits.** The Lighthouse integration means your agent can audit a page for accessibility violations, SEO issues, and best practices, then help you fix the findings — all within your editor.

**Full-stack developers who want eyes in the browser.** Connecting to your active browser session and asking the agent to check console errors, inspect network failures, or verify that your API calls are returning the right data — this is the "AI pair programmer that can see your screen" use case.

**Not ideal for:** Cross-browser testing (use Playwright MCP), simple web scraping (use a lighter tool), or environments where browser security isolation is critical.

## Recent Updates

- **September 2025:** Initial launch on `developer.chrome.com`. Core tools for navigation, interaction, screenshots, and JavaScript evaluation.
- **December 2025:** autoConnect feature for connecting to existing Chrome 144+ sessions without manual port configuration.
- **March 2026 (v0.20.x):** Performance tracing with Core Web Vitals insights, memory heap snapshots, Lighthouse audits, network request inspection, console message retrieval, CrUX integration, slim mode, form filling, emulation tools. Multiple releases per week with active bug fixes.

## The Bottom Line

Chrome DevTools MCP is a **4.5/5**. It's the most capable browser MCP server available — not because it has the most tools (29 is a lot, but not unprecedented), but because it exposes browser internals that no other MCP server can reach. Performance tracing, memory analysis, Lighthouse audits, and network inspection are capabilities that genuinely change what AI coding agents can do for frontend development.

The official Google backing, 30.7K stars, 330K weekly downloads, and 67 contributors give it a level of maintenance and adoption that few MCP servers match. The ability to connect to your actual browser session and debug live is a standout feature.

It loses half a point for the high token cost (18K for tool definitions with no granular loading), the security implications of browser-level access, default telemetry, and the autoConnect memory leak. But for any developer doing frontend work, this is the browser MCP server to install first — use Playwright MCP alongside it for cross-browser testing, but Chrome DevTools MCP for everything else.

**Rating: 4.5/5** — The definitive browser debugging MCP server, backed by the Chrome DevTools team. Performance tracing, Lighthouse audits, and live session debugging set it apart. High token cost and browser security exposure are the main trade-offs.
