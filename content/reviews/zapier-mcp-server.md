**At a glance:** 25 GitHub stars, 13 forks, remote-only (hosted), Streamable HTTP + SSE transport, 8,000+ apps, 30,000+ actions, $5B valuation, ~$400M revenue (2025).

Zapier MCP is the **official MCP server from the world's largest automation platform**. It connects AI agents like Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor to 8,000+ apps and 30,000+ actions through Zapier's hosted infrastructure — no self-hosting, no local setup, no OAuth plumbing. You pick which actions to expose through a web dashboard at [mcp.zapier.com](https://zapier.com/mcp), and your AI gets callable tools for each one.

The [zapier/zapier-mcp repository](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-mcp) has 25 GitHub stars and 13 forks — modest numbers because the actual server runs on Zapier's infrastructure. The repo contains plugins, skills, and configuration guides rather than server source code. Zapier was founded in 2012, is valued at $5B, has ~800–1,200 employees across 40 countries (fully remote), and generated an estimated $400M in revenue in 2025 — all while raising only $2.68M in outside funding. Investors include Sequoia Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, and DFJ (Threshold).

## How It Works

Unlike most MCP servers that run locally or self-hosted, Zapier MCP is a **fully managed remote server**. The architecture:

```
AI Agent → MCP Client → Zapier MCP Server (remote) → Zapier Platform → Target App API
```

### Setup Process

1. **Visit mcp.zapier.com** — browse available apps and actions
2. **Enable specific actions** — each action you add becomes a callable MCP tool (e.g., "Gmail: Send Email", "Slack: Send Message", "Google Sheets: Create Row")
3. **Authenticate** — connect your app accounts through Zapier's OAuth flows
4. **Configure your AI client** — point it at your Zapier MCP server URL

**For Claude Code:**
```bash
claude mcp add zapier --transport sse https://actions.zapier.com/mcp/YOUR_MCP_KEY/sse
```

**For Claude Desktop / Cursor (JSON config):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Zapier MCP": {
      "url": "https://actions.zapier.com/mcp/YOUR_MCP_KEY/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

There is one built-in meta-tool: **`get_configuration_url`** returns the mcp.zapier.com management URL so your AI can direct you to add or modify actions.

### Authentication

Two methods for connecting to the MCP server:

| Method | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **API Key** | Personal use and local development — generate at mcp.zapier.com |
| **OAuth 2.0** | Multi-user applications where end users connect their own Zapier accounts |

App-level authentication (connecting to Gmail, Slack, etc.) is handled entirely by Zapier's platform — you authorize once through Zapier's web UI, and the MCP server uses those stored credentials.

### Transport

Zapier MCP uses **remote transport only** — Streamable HTTP and SSE. No stdio option exists because the server runs on Zapier's infrastructure, not locally.

**Important:** Your MCP server URL functions like a password. Anyone with the URL can execute your enabled actions. Zapier provides URL rotation for security.

## Supported AI Clients

Zapier provides setup guides for a broad range of clients:

| Client | Setup Complexity | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| **Claude** (claude.ai) | Low | Direct integration via Connect tab |
| **Claude Desktop** | Low | MCP config JSON |
| **Claude Code** | Low | CLI command |
| **ChatGPT** | Low | Developer Mode required |
| **Cursor** | Low | MCP config JSON |
| **Windsurf** | Low | MCP settings page |
| **VS Code** | Low | MCP config JSON |
| **OpenAI API** | Medium | Developer implementation |
| **Anthropic API** | Medium | Developer implementation |
| **Microsoft Copilot Studio** | Medium | Platform integration |
| **ElevenLabs** | Medium | Voice AI integration |
| **Python / TypeScript** | Medium | SDK implementation |

This is the widest client support of any MCP server we've reviewed — partly because Zapier's remote architecture works with any client that supports HTTP-based MCP transport.

## App Coverage

With 8,000+ apps and 30,000+ actions, Zapier has the largest integration library of any MCP server:

| Category | Example Apps |
|----------|-------------|
| **Productivity** | Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Sheets, Google Drive, Notion, Todoist, Airtable, Trello |
| **Communication** | Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, WhatsApp, Outlook, Twilio |
| **CRM & Sales** | Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho CRM, Close |
| **Developer Tools** | GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Linear, Sentry, PagerDuty |
| **Marketing** | Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, ConvertKit, Constant Contact |
| **Social Media** | X (Twitter), Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok |
| **E-commerce** | Shopify, WooCommerce, Stripe, Square, PayPal |
| **Finance** | QuickBooks, Xero, FreshBooks, Wave |
| **HR & Recruiting** | BambooHR, Greenhouse, Lever, Workday |
| **Customer Support** | Zendesk, Intercom, Freshdesk, Help Scout |

You don't get access to all 30,000+ actions at once. You **manually select which actions to expose** through the web dashboard. Each enabled action becomes one MCP tool. This prevents context overload but requires manual curation — there's no dynamic discovery like Composio's Rube or Pipedream's app discovery mode.

## Pricing

Zapier MCP is available on all plans. Each MCP tool call costs **2 Zapier tasks**.

| Plan | Price | Tasks/Month | MCP Calls Equivalent | Features |
|------|-------|-------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | 100 | ~50 MCP calls | 2-step Zaps only |
| **Professional** | $19.99/mo | 750 | ~375 MCP calls | Multi-step Zaps |
| **Team** | $69/mo | 2,000 | ~1,000 MCP calls | 25 seats, SAML SSO, shared folders |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom | Custom | Dedicated support, governance tools |

**The pricing shift matters.** Before September 2025, Zapier MCP had a separate monthly limit of 300 tool calls. Now every call counts against your Zapier task quota at a 2:1 ratio. For AI agents that make many small calls — checking data, searching records, sending messages — this can burn through tasks quickly. An agent making 20 tool calls in a conversation uses 40 tasks, which is 40% of the free tier's monthly allowance.

All plans include unlimited Zaps, Tables, and Forms alongside MCP access.

## Security

- **OAuth 2.0 and API key authentication** for server access
- **Endpoint encryption** — all traffic over HTTPS
- **Rate limiting** — prevents abuse and runaway agents
- **Activity audit logs** — track which actions were called and when
- **SOC 2 Type II compliance** — Zapier's platform-level security certification
- **Credential isolation** — app credentials stored on Zapier's side, never exposed to the AI model
- **URL rotation** — regenerate your MCP server URL if compromised
- **Granular action control** — on/off toggles for individual actions without deletion

## Comparison With Alternatives

| Feature | **Zapier** | **Composio** | **Pipedream** | **n8n** |
|---------|-----------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| **Apps** | 8,000+ | 500+ | 2,800+ | 400+ |
| **Actions/Tools** | 30,000+ | 1,000+ toolkits | 10,000+ | Varies |
| **Architecture** | Remote only | SDK + hosted | Remote + npm | Self-hosted |
| **Action selection** | Manual (web UI) | Per-toolkit or dynamic (Rube) | Per-app endpoints | Node-based |
| **Self-hosted** | No | Yes (SDK) | npx (stale) | Yes |
| **Transport** | HTTP/SSE | stdio + HTTPS | HTTP/SSE/stdio | stdio |
| **Free tier** | 100 tasks (~50 calls) | 20K calls/mo | 100 credits | Unlimited (self-hosted) |
| **Pricing model** | Task-based (2 tasks/call) | Call-based | Credit-based (1 credit = 30s) | Execution-based |
| **License** | Proprietary | MIT | Proprietary | Fair-code (Sustainable Use) |

**vs. Composio:** Composio has far fewer apps (500+ vs. 8,000+) but offers self-hosting, MIT-licensed code, and a dramatically more generous free tier (20K calls/month vs. ~50 MCP calls). Composio's Rube dynamic discovery is more sophisticated than Zapier's manual action selection. For agent-heavy workloads, Composio's pricing is significantly cheaper.

**vs. Pipedream:** Pipedream sits between them — 2,800+ apps, per-app MCP endpoints that auto-generate tools, and a credit-based pricing model. Pipedream offers more developer control (three tool modes, self-hosted option) but was acquired by Workday (November 2025), introducing platform uncertainty.

**vs. n8n:** n8n is the developer-first choice — self-hosted, fair-code licensed, unlimited executions on self-hosted instances. Far fewer integrations (400+) but deeper AI workflow capabilities with visual node-based building. Best for teams that want full control and don't mind managing infrastructure.

**vs. Individual MCP Servers:** Dedicated servers for specific platforms (like the [GitHub MCP Server](/reviews/github-mcp-server/) or [Slack MCP Server](/reviews/slack-mcp-server/)) will always offer deeper, more complete API coverage. Zapier trades depth for breadth — convenient when you need many integrations, limiting when you need every feature of one API.

## Known Issues

- **Reliability concerns** — Independent reviewers describe the MCP implementation as "not ready for production" and "feels more like an alpha: unstable, poorly documented, and inconsistent in execution." Identical prompts can produce different results across runs.
- **OAuth failures** — Users report OAuth login failures, redirect URI mismatches with Claude Desktop (`invalid_request: Mismatching redirect URI`), and HTTP 500 errors during token exchange with Claude Code.
- **ChatGPT limitations** — MCP tools in ChatGPT only work in Developer Mode and don't automatically refresh available tools.
- **Inconsistent action execution** — Actions that work once may fail on retry, with unclear root causes related to latency, caching, or backend issues.
- **No self-hosted option** — Unlike Composio and n8n, there's no way to run Zapier MCP on your own infrastructure. You're fully dependent on Zapier's hosted service.
- **Manual action curation** — You must individually select and configure each action through the web UI. No dynamic discovery, no programmatic configuration, no bulk-add.
- **Task cost escalation** — At 2 tasks per call, AI agent workloads can consume task quotas quickly. A moderately active agent could exhaust the free tier in a single conversation.
- **Multi-account gaps** — Some integrations (e.g., Google Ads) automatically link to the primary account with no way to select or switch between accounts.
- **Slow iteration** — The AI Actions API has been in beta for over a year. The deprecated AI Actions product is being sunset in favor of MCP, but the transition is still incomplete.

## What We Think

**Rating: 3 out of 5**

Zapier MCP has the widest app coverage of any MCP server — 8,000+ apps and 30,000+ actions is unmatched. The setup experience is genuinely easy for non-technical users: visit a web page, pick your actions, paste a URL. No Docker, no npm, no OAuth configuration. Zapier handles all of that.

**But the execution doesn't match the promise.** Independent testing reveals an implementation that's still rough — inconsistent results, OAuth failures, and reliability issues that undermine confidence for production agent workflows. The "beta" label understates the current state.

**The pricing model is the bigger concern.** At 2 tasks per MCP call, AI agents burn through quotas fast. The free tier gives you ~50 MCP calls per month — enough to try it, not enough to build on. A Professional plan ($19.99/mo) gets you ~375 calls, which a busy agent could exhaust in a day. Compare this to Composio's 20,000 free calls/month or n8n's unlimited self-hosted executions.

**Where Zapier wins:** Non-technical users already paying for a Zapier plan with unused task capacity. The breadth of integrations is unmatched, and the web-based action configuration is the simplest in the market. If you need to connect an AI agent to 10+ apps quickly and you don't care about self-hosting, Zapier is the fastest path.

**Where it falls short:** Developers building agent systems will find the lack of self-hosting, proprietary architecture, closed-source server, 2x task pricing, and reliability issues all pointing toward alternatives. Composio and n8n offer more developer control, better pricing for agent workloads, and open-source codebases.

**Best for:** Non-technical users on existing Zapier plans who want to add AI capabilities to familiar workflows. **Not ideal for:** Developers building agent systems that need reliable, high-volume tool access at predictable cost.
