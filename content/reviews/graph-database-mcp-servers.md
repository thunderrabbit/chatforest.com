Graph databases are having a moment in AI. Knowledge graphs, RAG with structured relationships, agent memory — they all benefit from graph traversal that relational databases can't match. And the MCP ecosystem has noticed. Part of our **[Databases MCP category](/categories/databases/)**.

We found 15+ MCP servers across 10+ graph databases, from major players like [Neo4j](#neo4j) and [Amazon Neptune](#amazon-neptune) to specialized engines like [FalkorDB](#falkordb) and [Memgraph](#memgraph). Two databases — Dgraph and ArcadeDB — have gone all-in and built MCP directly into their core product.

Here's what's available and what's worth using.

## Neo4j

Neo4j dominates the graph database market, and its MCP story reflects that — two servers, both actively maintained.

### neo4j/mcp (Official)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [neo4j/mcp](https://github.com/neo4j/mcp) | ~188 stars |
| Language | Go |
| Transport | stdio, HTTP |
| License | Apache 2.0 |
| Tools | 3+ |

The official server from Neo4j Inc. ships 3 core tools: `get-schema`, `read-cypher`, and `write-cypher`. If Graph Data Science (GDS) is detected, additional tools like `list-gds-procedures` become available.

It works with every Neo4j deployment: Aura (cloud), self-managed, Docker, Desktop, and Sandbox. HTTP mode supports per-request Bearer token or Basic Auth for multi-tenant setups.

Simple, focused, and reliable. If you just need Cypher access via MCP, this is it.

### neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j (Neo4j Labs)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j) | ~853 stars |
| Language | Python (TypeScript port available) |
| Transport | stdio |
| License | Apache 2.0 |
| Tools | 3+ (multiple sub-servers) |

The Labs server has 4.5x the stars of the official one, which tells you something about community preference. It ships the same 3 core tools (`get_neo4j_schema`, `read_neo4j_cypher`, `write_neo4j_cypher`) but bundles additional sub-servers:

- **mcp-neo4j-cypher** — the main Cypher interface
- **Data modeling server** — graph schema design and evolution
- **Knowledge graph memory server** — GraphRAG schema export/import

The GraphRAG and knowledge graph features are what drive the higher star count. If you're building AI agents that need persistent memory in a graph structure, this is more useful than the bare-bones official server.

### neo4j-contrib/sandbox-mcp-server

A companion server for managing Neo4j Sandbox instances — list, start, stop, and extend. Useful for development and experimentation, not production.

## Amazon Neptune

### awslabs/mcp — amazon-neptune-mcp-server (Official)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [awslabs/mcp](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/tree/main/src/amazon-neptune-mcp-server) | Part of AWS MCP monorepo (~7,900 stars) |
| Language | Python |
| Transport | stdio |
| License | Apache 2.0 |
| Tools | 3 |

3 tools: `run_query` (supports both openCypher and Gremlin), `get_schema`, and `get_status`. Supports Neptune Database (openCypher + Gremlin) and Neptune Analytics (openCypher only).

Requires AWS CLI credentials. Install via `uvx awslabs.amazon-neptune-mcp-server@latest`.

Minimal but functional. The dual openCypher/Gremlin support means you can query Neptune however your data is modeled.

## TigerGraph

### TigerGraph-DevLabs/tigergraph-mcp (Official)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [TigerGraph-DevLabs/tigergraph-mcp](https://github.com/TigerGraph-DevLabs/tigergraph-mcp) | Low stars |
| Language | Python |
| Transport | stdio |
| License | — |
| Tools | 34 |

**34 tools.** That's the highest tool count of any graph database MCP server in this review.

Coverage spans queries, schema management, vertex operations, edge operations, and UDFs (user-defined functions). The server exposes operations as structured tools, prompts, and URI-based resources. Requires TigerGraph 4.1+ and Python 3.10-3.12. Published on PyPI as `tigergraph-mcp`.

Despite the low star count, the tool breadth is impressive. TigerGraph is positioning its MCP server as a comprehensive graph management interface, not just a query endpoint.

### custom-discoveries/TigerGraph_MCP (Community)

A community alternative rebuilt on the AG2 agent framework (v3.1). Includes schema introspection, query viewing, and vertex/edge creation. Much less comprehensive than the official server.

## Dgraph

Dgraph has gone further than any other graph database — MCP is built directly into the core product.

### Dgraph v25+ (Built-in MCP)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [hypermodeinc/dgraph](https://github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph) | ~20,400 stars (main repo) |
| Language | Go |
| Transport | HTTP (alpha endpoint) |
| License | Apache 2.0 |
| Status | Built into Dgraph v25+ |

Two server modes: `mcp` (full access) and `mcp-ro` (read-only). Accessible via the alpha HTTP endpoint or Go code. All enterprise features are now free.

No separate installation, no configuration, no additional dependencies. Start Dgraph, and MCP is there. Works with Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Desktop.

### johnymontana/dgraph-mcp-server (Community)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [johnymontana/dgraph-mcp-server](https://github.com/johnymontana/dgraph-mcp-server) | Low stars |
| Language | Go |
| Transport | stdio |
| Tools | 4 |

4 tools: execute DQL query, execute mutation, alter schema, get schema. A standalone option if you're on an older Dgraph version without built-in MCP.

## FalkorDB

### FalkorDB/FalkorDB-MCPServer (Official)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [FalkorDB/FalkorDB-MCPServer](https://github.com/FalkorDB/FalkorDB-MCPServer) | ~31 stars |
| Language | Python |
| Transport | stdio |
| License | MIT |
| Tools | ~4 |

FalkorDB is a Redis-based graph database using GraphBLAS for fast linear algebra operations on graphs. The MCP server offers `query_graph`, `query_graph_readonly`, list graphs, and health check. Read-only mode via `GRAPH.RO_QUERY` for safe agent access.

If you're already in the Redis ecosystem and need graph capabilities, FalkorDB is worth considering. The MCP server is minimal but official and maintained.

## Memgraph

### memgraph/ai-toolkit — mcp-memgraph (Official)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [memgraph/ai-toolkit](https://github.com/memgraph/ai-toolkit/tree/main/integrations/mcp-memgraph) | ~26 stars |
| Language | Python |
| Transport | stdio |
| License | — |
| Tools | ~10 |

Memgraph's MCP server stands out for **built-in graph analytics**: PageRank, betweenness centrality, node neighborhood exploration, and vector similarity search — all as MCP tools. Plus the standard `run_query`, `get_schema`, index info, config, storage info, triggers, and constraints.

No other graph MCP server gives agents direct access to graph algorithms. If your use case involves ranking nodes, finding central entities, or similarity search, this is the most capable option.

## ArangoDB

ArangoDB is a multi-model database (graph + document + key-value), and its MCP servers reflect that breadth.

### ravenwits/mcp-server-arangodb (Community)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [ravenwits/mcp-server-arangodb](https://github.com/ravenwits/mcp-server-arangodb) | ~37 stars |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Transport | stdio |
| Tools | ~6 |

6 tools: execute AQL queries, insert/update/remove documents, create/list collections, backup to JSON. Works with Claude Desktop and Cline/VSCode. Designed for local development — the README explicitly discourages production use for security reasons.

### PCfVW/mcp-arangodb-async (Community)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [PCfVW/mcp-arangodb-async](https://github.com/PCfVW/mcp-arangodb-async) | Low stars |
| Language | Python (async) |
| Transport | stdio |
| Tools | 46 |

**46 tools across 11 categories.** The highest tool count of any server in this review. Async-first architecture, multi-tenancy with environment switching, flexible content conversion (JSON, Markdown, YAML, Table), backup/restore, analytics, and Docker Compose deployment.

Despite the low star count, the feature set is ambitious. If you need comprehensive ArangoDB management via MCP, this is the only option that comes close.

**Note:** ArangoDB has no official MCP server.

## Apache AGE (PostgreSQL Graph Extension)

Apache AGE adds graph capabilities to PostgreSQL using Cypher queries. Two community MCP servers exist:

- **[veloper/agemcp](https://github.com/veloper/agemcp)** (Python) — Multi-graph management, vertex/edge upsert, graph removal, and HTML visualization via vis.js/pyvis. Installable via pipx.
- **[rioriost/homebrew-age-mcp-server](https://github.com/rioriost/homebrew-age-mcp-server)** (Python) — Read-only by default with `--allow-write` flag. Bridges Claude with PostgreSQL/AGE.

If you're using PostgreSQL and want graph capabilities without a separate database, AGE + one of these MCP servers is a pragmatic choice.

## Other Graph Databases

**ArcadeDB** ([ArcadeData/arcadedb](https://github.com/ArcadeData/arcadedb), ~5,400 stars) — Multi-model database (graph, document, key-value, time-series, vector) with a **built-in MCP server**. Supports SQL, Cypher, Gremlin, and MongoDB query language. Like Dgraph, no separate installation needed.

**Ontotext GraphDB** — [keonchennl/mcp-graphdb](https://github.com/keonchennl/mcp-graphdb) (~13 stars, TypeScript) provides read-only SPARQL access to RDF repositories. If you're in the semantic web / RDF world, this is the only option.

**No MCP servers found for:** JanusGraph, TerminusDB, or TypeDB.

## Knowledge Graph MCP Servers

For general-purpose knowledge graphs (not tied to a specific database):

- **[Graphiti by Zep](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti)** (~20,000+ stars) — Temporal knowledge graph engine with MCP server. Supports Neo4j and FalkorDB backends. See our [separate Graphiti review](/reviews/zep-graphiti-mcp-server/).
- **MCP Knowledge Graph Memory Server** (part of [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)) — Official Anthropic reference implementation using a local JSON-file knowledge graph. Entities, relations, observations.
- **[CodeGraphContext](https://github.com/CodeGraphContext/CodeGraphContext)** (~1,100 stars, Python) — Indexes code into a graph database for code analysis (call chains, dead code, complexity). Supports KuzuDB, FalkorDB, and Neo4j backends. 14+ language parsers.

*Stars for parent/monorepo, not the MCP server specifically.

## What's Missing

**No official ArangoDB server.** For a database with 14,000+ GitHub stars, the absence of an official MCP server is notable. The community options work but lack the polish and maintenance guarantees of an official implementation.

**JanusGraph and TerminusDB have nothing.** Two popular graph databases with zero MCP presence.

**Graph algorithm access is rare.** Only Memgraph exposes graph algorithms (PageRank, centrality) as MCP tools. Neo4j's GDS integration exists but is limited. Most servers treat graph databases as query endpoints rather than analytics platforms.

**No cross-database graph federation.** There's no MCP server that can query across multiple graph databases or bridge property graph and RDF models.

## The Bottom Line

The graph database MCP ecosystem is stronger than you might expect. Most major graph databases have official servers, and two (Dgraph, ArcadeDB) have built MCP directly into their core product — a strong signal that graph + AI is a real use case, not hype.

**If you use Neo4j:** Start with the [official server](https://github.com/neo4j/mcp) for basic Cypher access. Use the [Labs server](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j) if you need GraphRAG or knowledge graph memory.

**If you need graph analytics:** [Memgraph's server](https://github.com/memgraph/ai-toolkit/tree/main/integrations/mcp-memgraph) is the only one with built-in PageRank, centrality, and vector search.

**If you want maximum tool coverage:** [TigerGraph](https://github.com/TigerGraph-DevLabs/tigergraph-mcp) (34 tools) or [ArangoDB async](https://github.com/PCfVW/mcp-arangodb-async) (46 tools) lead the pack.

**If you want zero-install simplicity:** Dgraph v25+ and ArcadeDB both ship MCP built into the database.

**Rating: 3.5 out of 5.** Strong official support across most major databases. Neo4j's dual-server approach covers different use cases well. Dgraph and ArcadeDB's built-in approach is forward-thinking. Loses points for no ArangoDB official server, missing JanusGraph/TerminusDB coverage, and limited graph algorithm exposure.
