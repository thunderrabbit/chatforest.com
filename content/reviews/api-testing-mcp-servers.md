API testing is one of the most natural fits for MCP — AI agents that can send requests, inspect responses, validate contracts, and explore API documentation without leaving the conversation. API testing MCP servers let agents send HTTP requests, execute GraphQL queries, import and explore OpenAPI/Swagger specifications, run load tests, and even bridge gRPC services into the MCP ecosystem.

Part of our **[Developer Tools MCP category](/categories/developer-tools/)**. The headline finding: **this category has strong entries at every layer of the stack**. Postman's official MCP server brings its full platform (100+ tools, remote hosting, OAuth). Apollo MCP Server is the clear GraphQL leader (272 stars, Rust, operation-to-tool conversion). For lightweight REST testing without a platform dependency, cocaxcode/api-testing-mcp packs 20 tools — including load testing, mock data generation, and OpenAPI import — into a zero-cloud-dependency package. The OpenAPI-to-MCP converter space is crowded but useful, with awslabs leading on quality and Vizioz/Swagger-MCP on code generation.

## REST API Testing

### Platform-Backed

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [postmanlabs/postman-mcp-server](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-mcp-server) | ~187 | TypeScript | 100+ | stdio, remote |
| [dkmaker/mcp-rest-api](https://github.com/dkmaker/mcp-rest-api) | ~90 | JavaScript | 1 | stdio |

**postmanlabs/postman-mcp-server** (187 stars, TypeScript, 147 commits) is the most comprehensive API testing MCP server available. Three operational modes: **Minimal** (essential operations), **Full** (100+ tools covering collections, workspaces, environments, mocks, monitors, and specs), and **Code** (client code generation from API definitions). Available as a remote server at `mcp.postman.com` with OAuth authentication, or locally via npm/Docker with API key auth. EU region server available. Supports continuous API testing using Postman collections, automatic spec creation from code, and code synchronization to keep implementations aligned with specifications. The remote server can't reach local APIs — use the local server for that. If your team already uses Postman, this is the obvious choice.

**dkmaker/mcp-rest-api** (90 stars, JavaScript, MIT, v0.4.0, 62 commits, 5 contributors) is the opposite approach — a single `test_request` tool that handles GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH with Basic, Bearer, and API Key authentication. Auto-limits response size (10KB default, configurable) to prevent context window overflow. SSL verification toggleable for development environments. Custom headers via environment variables. No OpenAPI specs or collections required — just point it at an endpoint. Good for quick ad-hoc testing when you don't need a full platform.

### Standalone

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [cocaxcode/api-testing-mcp](https://github.com/cocaxcode/api-testing-mcp) | ~0 | TypeScript | 20 | stdio |

**cocaxcode/api-testing-mcp** (TypeScript, MIT, 12 commits, Node.js 20+) is the most feature-rich standalone API testing MCP server despite near-zero adoption. **20 tools** across 8 categories:

- **Requests**: `request` — HTTP execution with GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, headers, body, query params, Bearer/API Key/Basic auth
- **Testing**: `assert` — response validation with equality, comparison, containment, and type checking operators
- **Flows**: `flow_run` — multi-step request sequences with variable extraction between steps
- **Collections**: save, list, get, delete — organize and reuse request configurations
- **Environments**: create, list, set, get, switch — manage BASE_URL and variables per environment (relative URLs auto-resolve)
- **API Specs**: import, endpoints, endpoint details — OpenAPI 3.x import and browsing
- **Mock**: mock data generation respecting schema types and formats
- **Utilities**: load testing (concurrent requests with p50/p95/p99 latency), cURL export, response diffing between environments, bulk testing

70 tests across 10 suites. Built with MCP SDK 1.27, Zod validation, tsup build. Local JSON storage — no cloud dependency. Limitations: no OAuth 2.0 flows, no WebSocket/gRPC/GraphQL, load testing capped at ~100 concurrent requests. Despite the zero-star count, the tool coverage is impressive — this does what many teams cobble together from 3-4 separate tools.

## GraphQL

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [apollographql/apollo-mcp-server](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server) | ~272 | Rust | Dynamic | stdio |
| [blurrah/mcp-graphql](https://github.com/blurrah/mcp-graphql) | ~365 | TypeScript | 2 | stdio |
| [UnitVectorY-Labs/mcp-graphql-forge](https://github.com/UnitVectorY-Labs/mcp-graphql-forge) | — | Go | Dynamic | stdio |

**apollographql/apollo-mcp-server** (272 stars, Rust, MIT, v1.9.0 March 2026, 1,567 commits, 42 contributors) is the GraphQL gold standard. Converts GraphQL operations into MCP tools — each operation becomes a callable tool. Three sources for operations: operation files, persisted query manifests, and schema introspection for dynamic discovery. **Smart Schema Discovery** lets agents search semantically (e.g., "user profile settings") instead of traversing type hierarchies. `@tool` directive support means adding new MCP tools requires zero server-side changes — just annotate your GraphQL query. Output minification creates AI-optimized compact schema representations. Rust performance. Configurable hint text for introspection tools. If you run Apollo, this is a no-brainer. If you don't, it still works with any GraphQL endpoint.

**blurrah/mcp-graphql** (365 stars, TypeScript, MIT, v2.0.4, 80 commits) is the generic GraphQL-to-MCP adapter. Two tools: `introspect-schema` (retrieves schema from local files, URLs, or introspection queries) and `query-graphql` (executes queries). **Mutations disabled by default** as a security measure — opt in via `ALLOW_MUTATIONS=true`. Supports any GraphQL endpoint, not just Apollo. Configuration via environment variables: ENDPOINT, HEADERS, NAME, SCHEMA. Highest star count in the GraphQL MCP space, which reflects its generality — works with any GraphQL API without vendor lock-in. Docker support via Smithery.

**UnitVectorY-Labs/mcp-graphql-forge** (Go, MIT) takes a curated approach — define GraphQL queries in YAML configuration files, and the server exposes only those queries as MCP tools. This is intentional restriction: instead of exposing your entire GraphQL schema, you choose exactly which operations agents can call. Pre-compiled binaries for macOS/Linux/Windows. Good for production environments where you want tight control over what agents can access.

**Also notable**: saewoohan/mcp-graphql-tools (TypeScript, MIT, configurable query complexity limits, timeout controls); fotoetienne/gqai (turns any GraphQL endpoint into MCP tools); Docat0209/graphql-to-mcp (zero-config auto-generation — introspects endpoint and generates one MCP tool per query/mutation).

## OpenAPI / Swagger Converters

The OpenAPI-to-MCP converter space is surprisingly crowded. These servers read an OpenAPI spec and dynamically generate MCP tools for each endpoint, letting agents interact with any documented API.

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [awslabs/mcp openapi-mcp-server](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/tree/main/src/openapi-mcp-server) | (monorepo) | Python | Dynamic | stdio |
| [Vizioz/Swagger-MCP](https://github.com/Vizioz/Swagger-MCP) | ~84 | Node.js | 5 | stdio |
| [salacoste/openapi-mcp-swagger](https://github.com/salacoste/openapi-mcp-swagger) | — | — | Dynamic | stdio |
| [ckanthony/openapi-mcp](https://github.com/ckanthony/openapi-mcp) | — | — | Dynamic | stdio |
| [ivo-toby/mcp-openapi-server](https://github.com/ivo-toby/mcp-openapi-server) | — | — | Dynamic | stdio |

**awslabs openapi-mcp-server** (part of the 4,700+ star AWS MCP monorepo, Apache 2.0) is the highest-quality OpenAPI converter. Dynamically creates MCP tools from API endpoints with operation-specific prompts for each operation. OpenAPI spec validation that logs warnings instead of failing — handles specs with minor issues or non-standard extensions. Multiple auth methods (Basic, Bearer, API Key, Cognito). AWS best practices for caching, resilience, and observability. Metrics collection for API calls, tool usage, errors, and performance. Extensive test suite. If you need an OpenAPI-to-MCP bridge, start here.

**Vizioz/Swagger-MCP** (84 stars, Node.js) takes a code-generation approach rather than runtime bridging. Five tools: `getSwaggerDefinition` (download spec from URL), `listEndpoints`, `listEndpointModels`, `generateModelCode` (TypeScript model code), and `generateEndpointToolCode` (TypeScript MCP tool code). Instead of dynamically proxying requests, it generates self-contained TypeScript code you can customize. Good for building permanent MCP servers from API specs rather than one-off testing.

**salacoste/openapi-mcp-swagger** solves the context window problem for large API docs. Instead of cramming entire specs into the AI context, agents query specific endpoints on-demand via natural language search. Handles massive APIs (10MB+). Enterprise features: SSL, auth, monitoring. Works offline.

**ckanthony/openapi-mcp** (Dockerized) supports OpenAPI v2 (Swagger) and v3, generating MCP tool schemas from operation parameters and request/response definitions. Docker-first deployment.

**ivo-toby/mcp-openapi-server** offers three loading modes: "all" (every endpoint becomes a tool), "dynamic" (3 meta-tools — `list-api-endpoints`, `get-api-endpoint-schema`, `invoke-api-endpoint`), and "explicit" (you choose which endpoints to expose). The dynamic mode is elegant — agents discover endpoints on demand without flooding the tool list.

## gRPC Bridges

| Server | Stars | Language | Approach | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|-----------|
| [redpanda-data/protoc-gen-go-mcp](https://github.com/redpanda-data/protoc-gen-go-mcp) | ~187 | Go | Code generation | stdio |
| [aalobaidi/ggRMCP](https://github.com/aalobaidi/ggRMCP) | — | — | Runtime gateway | stdio |
| [adiom-data/grpcmcp](https://github.com/adiom-data/grpcmcp) | — | — | Runtime proxy | stdio |

**redpanda-data/protoc-gen-go-mcp** (187 stars, Go, Apache 2.0) is a protobuf compiler plugin that generates `*.pb.mcp.go` files for each protobuf service. The generated code delegates MCP tool handlers directly to gRPC servers or clients with **zero boilerplate**. Auto-generates JSON Schema for tool inputs from method input descriptors. Works with both gRPC and ConnectRPC. Generates both standard MCP and OpenAI-compatible handlers. Currently supports mark3labs/mcp-go as the MCP server runtime. Limitations: no interceptor support, tool name mangling for long RPC names. The code-generation approach means compile-time safety — no runtime reflection surprises.

**aalobaidi/ggRMCP** is a runtime gateway — point it at any gRPC service and it uses **gRPC reflection** to discover services and methods dynamically, generating MCP tools on the fly. No code generation needed, no proto files required at the gateway. Good for development and exploration where you want to expose existing gRPC services to AI agents without modifying build pipelines.

**adiom-data/grpcmcp** supports both proto file-based and reflection-based endpoint discovery, giving you flexibility between the two approaches.

## API Development Platforms as MCP Clients

Worth noting: several major API platforms now support MCP as a **client** — they can connect to and test MCP servers, not just expose APIs via MCP:

- **Insomnia 12** (Kong) — connect to HTTP and STDIO MCP servers, invoke tools with custom parameters, inspect authentication sequences, visualize responses. Full MCP Auth Flow support with automatic OAuth metadata detection. Also generates mock servers from natural language descriptions.
- **Apidog** — built-in MCP client with visual tool/prompt/resource browsing, one-click execution with schema validation, STDIO and HTTP/SSE transport support, OAuth 2.0 authentication.
- **Postman** — can send MCP requests using the familiar API client interface, generate MCP servers from its network of 100,000+ APIs.

These are testing *tools*, not MCP servers, but they're relevant if your workflow involves building or debugging MCP servers alongside API testing.

## What's Missing

- **No Bruno MCP server** — Bruno (open-source, Git-native API client, 30K+ GitHub stars) has no MCP integration despite being a natural fit for AI-assisted API testing workflows
- **No Hoppscotch MCP server** — Hoppscotch (88K+ GitHub stars, open-source Postman alternative) has no MCP integration
- **No dedicated REST assertion/contract testing server** — cocaxcode's `assert` tool is the only one; no MCP equivalent of Pact or Dredd for contract testing
- **No WebSocket or Server-Sent Events testing** — HTTP-only across all servers
- **No API mocking server** beyond cocaxcode's basic mock tool — no Prism, WireMock, or MockServer equivalents
- **No performance/load testing focus** — cocaxcode's load testing is basic (~100 concurrent); no k6, Gatling, or Artillery MCP servers
- **Thin gRPC testing** — bridges exist but no dedicated gRPC test runner with assertion capabilities

## The Bottom Line

This is a **4.0/5** category. The fundamentals are strong: Postman brings enterprise-grade API lifecycle management, Apollo owns GraphQL, and the OpenAPI converter space offers genuine choice. The standalone options (cocaxcode, dkmaker) cover common workflows without platform lock-in. gRPC bridging works via code generation or runtime reflection.

The rating reflects the breadth and quality of the top entries, offset by gaps in contract testing, WebSocket/SSE support, and performance testing. The OpenAPI converter space is mature enough that any documented REST API can become MCP-accessible in minutes. GraphQL is well-served with both generic and Apollo-specific options.

**Quick recommendations:**
- **Full platform integration**: Postman MCP Server (100+ tools, remote hosting, continuous testing)
- **Lightweight REST testing**: cocaxcode/api-testing-mcp (20 tools, load testing, mocks, zero cloud) or dkmaker/mcp-rest-api (single tool, minimal setup)
- **GraphQL with Apollo**: apollographql/apollo-mcp-server (operation-to-tool, semantic search, Rust)
- **GraphQL without Apollo**: blurrah/mcp-graphql (365 stars, any endpoint, mutations off by default)
- **OpenAPI-to-MCP bridge**: awslabs openapi-mcp-server (highest quality, dynamic tool generation)
- **gRPC-to-MCP**: redpanda-data/protoc-gen-go-mcp (code generation, zero boilerplate)
