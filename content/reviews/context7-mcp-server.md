Context7 is the most popular MCP server in 2026. Not by a small margin — with 10.1 million estimated visitors on PulseMCP (#4 globally, #3 this week as of March 2026), it dwarfs the competition. Built by [Upstash](https://upstash.com), it solves a genuine pain point: AI coding assistants hallucinate APIs that don't exist because their training data is months or years out of date.

The fix is simple. When your agent needs to use a library, Context7 fetches the current, version-specific documentation and injects it directly into the prompt. No tab-switching, no copy-pasting from docs sites, no outdated code generation. With 50,100 GitHub stars, 2,400 forks, 113 contributors, and a growing ecosystem that now includes a CLI, a VS Code extension, and a Skills-based plugin system, it's achieved the kind of adoption most MCP servers dream about.

**At a glance:** 50.1K stars, 2.4K forks, 148 open issues, MCP server v2.1.4 (March 10, 2026), CLI ctx7 v0.3.6 (March 16, 2026), ~10.1M estimated visitors on PulseMCP

But popularity doesn't mean perfection. A critical context poisoning vulnerability ([ContextCrush](https://noma.security/blog/contextcrush-context7-the-mcp-server-vulnerability/)) was discovered and patched in February 2026. The free tier was quietly cut by 83–92% in January 2026. And the fundamental architecture — a centralized registry that delivers documentation straight into your agent's context — creates a trust surface that most developers haven't thought through.

## What's New (March 2026 Update)

Since our original review on March 14, Context7 has shipped steadily. Here are the key developments:

**Platform evolution — Skills, Plugins, and VS Code.** Context7 is no longer just a two-tool MCP server. The new `ctx7 setup` command (introduced in v0.3.0, February 16) auto-detects your editor — Cursor, Claude Code, OpenCode — and configures the integration via OAuth. For Claude Code, Context7 now offers a Skills-based plugin that triggers documentation lookup automatically when your agent detects it's working with a known framework (React, Next.js, Prisma, etc.), eliminating the need to explicitly say "use context7." There's also an official VS Code extension on the Marketplace for Copilot users.

**CLI gains real utility.** The CLI (`npx ctx7`) gained `library` and `docs` commands in v0.3.2 (March 6) for terminal-based documentation queries. v0.3.3 added categorical reputation labels (High/Medium/Low/Unknown) for libraries and source repository disambiguation. v0.3.4 introduced a 4-star popularity scale with install counts and trust scores — useful for evaluating lesser-known libraries before trusting their docs.

**MCP server hardening.** v2.1.3 (March 4) rejects GET requests on MCP endpoints with a 405 status, eliminating idle SSE timeout issues. The SSE transport protocol is officially deprecated — HTTP and stdio are the supported transports going forward. v2.1.4 (March 10) adds a warning when the public library access filter is active.

**Growth continues.** Stars jumped from 48,900 to 50,100 (+1,000 in one week). PulseMCP shows 10.1 million estimated visitors with ~496K this week alone. The contributor count has grown to 113. Open issues have risen from 129 to 148, reflecting continued scaling challenges.

**Alternatives are catching up.** Docfork (9,000+ libraries, MIT license, Cabinets feature for context isolation) reached 324 GitHub stars and 11,000 PulseMCP views. DeepWiki offers architectural understanding rather than raw docs. Ref Tools focuses on token efficiency. The competitive landscape is broadening.

## What It Does

Context7 provides exactly two MCP tools:

**`resolve-library-id`** — Takes a general library name (like "react" or "nextjs") and returns a list of matching libraries from Context7's registry, each with a Context7-compatible ID. This is the lookup step.

**`query-docs`** — Takes a Context7 library ID and a topic, then returns version-specific documentation, code examples, and API references for that library. This is the delivery step.

That's it. Two tools. The simplicity is a feature — there's nothing to configure per-query, no complex parameter tuning. Your agent asks "how do I use X in library Y?" and gets current documentation back.

Behind the scenes, Context7 maintains a registry of thousands of libraries — Next.js, React, MongoDB, Supabase, Django, FastAPI, and many more. The documentation is community-contributed: anyone can publish a library's docs to the registry. The server fetches from this centralized store, not from the library's actual documentation site at query time.

### CLI Mode

Context7 also offers a CLI (`npx ctx7`) that works outside the MCP protocol:

- `ctx7 library <name>` — search for libraries
- `ctx7 docs <library-id> <topic>` — retrieve documentation

This is useful for scripting, CI/CD integration, or quick lookups without an MCP client.

## Setup

Context7 supports multiple installation paths:

**Quick setup (recommended):**
```bash
npx ctx7 setup
```
This auto-detects your editor (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) and configures the MCP connection with OAuth authentication.

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest
```
Or with an API key for higher rate limits:
```bash
claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

**Claude Desktop / Cursor (JSON config):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

**With API key (recommended):**
Get a free key at [context7.com/dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard) for higher rate limits. Without a key, you're on the anonymous tier, which is more restrictive.

Setup is genuinely painless. One command, no local dependencies beyond Node.js, works across 30+ MCP clients. The new `ctx7 setup` auto-detection makes this even smoother — it identifies your editor, authenticates via OAuth, generates an API key, and configures everything automatically. For VS Code users, there's also an official extension on the Marketplace. This is one of Context7's strongest selling points — it's easier to set up than almost any other MCP server we've reviewed.

## What Works

**It solves the right problem.** AI coding assistants hallucinate APIs constantly. You ask for a React 19 pattern and get React 16 code. You ask for a Next.js App Router solution and get Pages Router. Context7 addresses this directly by giving your agent access to current documentation. When it works, the improvement in code quality is immediately noticeable.

**Massive library coverage.** Thousands of libraries are indexed, covering the major web frameworks, databases, cloud SDKs, and tooling libraries. For mainstream development stacks, Context7 almost certainly has your libraries covered.

**Two-tool simplicity.** The resolve-then-query pattern is clean and predictable. Agents learn it quickly, and there are no complex configuration options to get wrong. Compare this to Exa's 9 tools or Playwright's 25+ — Context7 is deliberately minimal.

**Broad client support.** Works with Cursor, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, VS Code Copilot, Windsurf, OpenCode, and 30+ other MCP-compatible clients. The `npx ctx7 setup` command handles auto-detection. This is table-stakes for adoption, and Context7 nails it.

**Active development.** 50,100 GitHub stars, 2,400 forks, 113 contributors, regular releases (10 releases in February–March 2026 alone). Upstash is a real company (they also build Redis and Kafka-as-a-service) with an incentive to maintain this. This isn't a weekend project that'll be abandoned.

**Skills-based integration.** The new Claude Code plugin uses Skills instead of SessionStart hooks, meaning Context7 activates intelligently when your agent detects framework usage — not on every prompt. This reduces token waste and makes the integration feel native rather than bolted-on.

## What Doesn't Work

### The ContextCrush Vulnerability (Patched)

In February 2026, [Noma Security](https://noma.security/blog/contextcrush-context7-the-mcp-server-vulnerability/) discovered a critical vulnerability they named "ContextCrush." Context7's "Custom Rules" feature allowed library publishers to set "AI Instructions" that were served directly to AI agents — with no sanitization.

The attack worked in three steps:
1. Anyone could register and publish a library to Context7's registry (open registration)
2. Custom rules were delivered unfiltered through the MCP server
3. AI agents interpreted these rules as trusted instructions and executed them using their own tool access (file operations, bash, network)

Noma demonstrated a proof-of-concept that read `.env` files, exfiltrated credentials via GitHub Issues, and deleted files — all triggered by an agent querying a poisoned library.

**The core issue:** Context7 serves as both the registry (where anyone can publish) and the trusted delivery mechanism (pushing content into the agent's context). That dual role creates an inherent trust problem.

Upstash patched this within two days of notification (disclosed Feb 18, fixed Feb 23, published March 5, 2026). But the architectural question remains: any centralized documentation registry that feeds directly into AI agent context is a tempting attack surface. The patch adds sanitization, but the trust model — community-contributed docs delivered as trusted context — is inherent to the design.

### Free Tier Gutted (January 2026)

In January 2026, Context7 [quietly reduced](https://blog.devgenius.io/context7-quietly-slashed-its-free-tier-by-92-16fa05ddce03) the free tier from ~6,000 to 1,000 requests per month. That's an 83% cut. Users also reported it dropping as low as 500 requests with a 60 requests/hour rate limit — a 92% reduction.

For a tool that triggers on virtually every code-related prompt (when the agent decides it needs documentation), 1,000 requests/month can evaporate fast. Multiple developers reported hitting the limit within the first week, at which point their agent falls back to hallucinating outdated patterns — the exact problem Context7 exists to solve.

After hitting the monthly cap, you get 20 bonus requests per day until the month resets. The Pro tier costs $10/seat/month for 5,000 requests, with overage at $10 per 1,000 additional calls.

This isn't unreasonable for a commercial product — but the *way* it happened (quiet reduction, no advance notice, no grandfathering) eroded trust. When your AI agent suddenly starts hallucinating again mid-session because you've exhausted your invisible quota, that's a bad developer experience.

### Documentation Quality Is Unverified

Context7's registry is community-contributed. Their own disclaimer: "Context7 projects are community-contributed and while we strive to maintain high quality, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or security of all library documentation."

This means:
- Documentation may be outdated despite the "always current" marketing
- Coverage varies — popular libraries are well-indexed, niche ones may have gaps
- There's no automated verification that docs match the actual library source
- The "Report" button is the primary quality control mechanism

For a tool whose value proposition is "no more outdated docs," the reliance on community curation introduces the same staleness risk it claims to eliminate — just at a different layer.

### Connection Issues Across Platforms

With 148 open GitHub issues (up from 129 in our original review), connection problems are a recurring theme:
- **Windows:** timeout errors on startup, `spawn context7-mcp ENOENT` errors
- **Windsurf:** adding a local Context7 MCP can break all other MCP servers (refresh loop)
- **Claude Desktop:** persistent "Not connected" errors despite correct configuration
- **Self-hosted:** authentication errors when using custom API keys

The SSE deprecation (now replaced by HTTP and stdio transports) should help with timeout-related issues, but the growing issue count suggests the team is still playing catch-up with the scale of adoption.

## Pricing

| Plan | Cost | Monthly Requests | Overage | Private Repos |
|------|------|-----------------|---------|--------------|
| Free | $0 | 1,000 (+20/day bonus after cap) | — | No |
| Pro | $10/seat/month | 5,000/seat | $10 per 1,000 | Yes ($25 per 1M tokens) |
| Enterprise | Custom | 5,000/seat | $10 per 1,000 | Yes ($25 per 1M tokens) |

Enterprise adds SOC-2/GDPR compliance, SSO, self-hosted deployment, and dedicated support.

## Compared To

### Docfork
Open-source (MIT), covers 9,000+ libraries, and its standout feature is "Cabinets" — project-specific context isolation that locks your agent to a verified dependency stack. This prevents context poisoning from unrelated libraries. No rate limits. Requires only one API call per request (vs. Context7's two), cutting response time roughly in half. Now at 324 GitHub stars and 11,000 PulseMCP views — growing, but still a fraction of Context7's reach.

### GitMCP
Free, open-source, remote MCP server that turns any GitHub repository into a documentation source by reading `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, and README files. No signup, no API key, no downloads. The trade-off: it reads raw repo docs, not curated/structured documentation. Works best for well-documented repos.

### Deepcon
Claims 90% accuracy in contextual benchmarks vs. Context7's 65% (tested across 20 real-world scenarios). Token-efficient (~1,000 tokens per response). Supports Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and Rust. Newer and less proven at scale.

### DeepWiki
Takes a different approach — rather than serving raw documentation, DeepWiki generates architectural understanding of repositories. Useful when you need to grasp how a codebase fits together, not just individual API references.

### Nia
Improves Cursor's performance by 27% (their benchmark) by indexing documentation and codebases. Focuses on coding agent augmentation beyond just documentation retrieval.

### Ref Tools
Focused on token efficiency — delivers documentation context using fewer tokens than Context7. Worth considering if you're working with context-limited models or want to minimize costs.

### llms.txt Standard
Not an MCP server, but a relevant alternative approach. The [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) proposal standardizes how libraries expose documentation for AI consumption. If widely adopted, it would make centralized registries like Context7 less necessary — your agent could fetch docs directly from the library's site. Growing adoption but not yet universal.

## Who Should Use This

**Use Context7 if:**
- You work with mainstream libraries (React, Next.js, Django, etc.) where Context7 has strong coverage
- You want zero-config documentation injection — just install and go
- The free tier (1,000 requests/month) is sufficient for your workflow, or $10/month for Pro is acceptable
- You're comfortable with the centralized registry trust model

**Consider alternatives if:**
- You're security-conscious about what gets injected into your agent's context (look at Docfork's Cabinets feature)
- You work primarily with niche or internal libraries (Context7's community-contributed model may not cover them)
- You need unlimited free usage (look at GitMCP or Docfork)
- You want to self-host your documentation source (look at GitMCP or the llms.txt standard)

## The Verdict

Context7 solves a real problem — AI agents need current documentation to stop hallucinating outdated APIs. The two-tool design is clean, setup is painless (even more so with `ctx7 setup`), and library coverage for mainstream stacks is good. The new Skills-based plugin system and VS Code extension show Upstash is investing in making Context7 feel native to every major editor. There's a reason it's the most popular MCP server of 2026.

But the centralized registry model creates risks that the alternatives avoid. The ContextCrush vulnerability (patched) demonstrated that any system delivering community-contributed content directly into agent context is an attack surface. The free tier cut (1,000 requests/month, down from ~6,000) pushes active developers toward the $10/month Pro plan. The community-contributed documentation, while extensive, has no automated verification against source — undermining the "always current" promise. And with 143 open issues (up from 129), the team is still catching up to the scale of adoption.

The competitive landscape is also shifting. Docfork offers Cabinets for context isolation, faster single-call responses, and no rate limits. DeepWiki provides architectural understanding. Ref Tools minimizes token usage. The "must-use" case for Context7 is less clear than it was even a month ago.

The rating: **3.5 out of 5.** Context7 is the most accessible documentation MCP server available. The problem it solves is genuine, the execution is mostly good, and the adoption numbers are real. The Skills integration and active release cadence (10 releases in Feb–March 2026) show genuine momentum. But the security history, aggressive monetization shift, unverified documentation quality, and growing competition prevent it from scoring higher. Developers who care about supply chain security should look at Docfork or GitMCP; developers who need unlimited free usage have better options.

For a tool with 10.1 million estimated visitors, 3.5 might seem low. But popularity isn't quality — it's distribution. Context7 got the distribution right. The quality needs to catch up.
