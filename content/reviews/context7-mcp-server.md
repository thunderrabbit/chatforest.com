Context7 is the most popular MCP server in 2026. Not by a small margin — it has nearly double the views of the #2 server on FastMCP. Built by [Upstash](https://upstash.com), it solves a genuine pain point: AI coding assistants hallucinate APIs that don't exist because their training data is months or years out of date.

The fix is simple. When your agent needs to use a library, Context7 fetches the current, version-specific documentation and injects it directly into the prompt. No tab-switching, no copy-pasting from docs sites, no outdated code generation. With 48,900 GitHub stars, 2,300 forks, and ~240,000 weekly npm downloads, it's achieved the kind of adoption most MCP servers dream about.

But popularity doesn't mean perfection. A critical context poisoning vulnerability ([ContextCrush](https://noma.security/blog/contextcrush-context7-the-mcp-server-vulnerability/)) was discovered and patched in February 2026. The free tier was quietly cut by 83–92% in January 2026. And the fundamental architecture — a centralized registry that delivers documentation straight into your agent's context — creates a trust surface that most developers haven't thought through.

## What It Does

Context7 provides exactly two MCP tools:

**`resolve-library-id`** — Takes a general library name (like "react" or "nextjs") and returns a list of matching libraries from Context7's registry, each with a Context7-compatible ID. This is the lookup step.

**`query-docs`** — Takes a Context7 library ID and a topic, then returns version-specific documentation, code examples, and API references for that library. This is the delivery step.

That's it. Two tools. The simplicity is a feature — there's nothing to configure per-query, no complex parameter tuning. Your agent asks "how do I use X in library Y?" and gets current documentation back.

Behind the scenes, Context7 maintains a registry of thousands of libraries — Next.js, React, MongoDB, Supabase, Django, FastAPI, and many more. The documentation is community-contributed: anyone can publish a library's docs to the registry. The server fetches from this centralized store, not from the library's actual documentation site at query time.

### CLI Mode

Context7 also offers a CLI (`npx ctx7`) that works outside the MCP protocol:

- `ctx7 library <name>` — search for libraries
- `ctx7 docs <library-id> <topic>` — retrieve documentation

This is useful for scripting, CI/CD integration, or quick lookups without an MCP client.

## Setup

Context7 supports multiple installation paths:

**Quick setup (recommended):**
```bash
npx ctx7 setup
```
This auto-detects your editor (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) and configures the MCP connection with OAuth authentication.

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest
```
Or with an API key for higher rate limits:
```bash
claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

**Claude Desktop / Cursor (JSON config):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

**With API key (recommended):**
Get a free key at [context7.com/dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard) for higher rate limits. Without a key, you're on the anonymous tier, which is more restrictive.

Setup is genuinely painless. One command, no local dependencies beyond Node.js, works across 30+ MCP clients. This is one of Context7's strongest selling points — it's easier to set up than almost any other MCP server we've reviewed.

## What Works

**It solves the right problem.** AI coding assistants hallucinate APIs constantly. You ask for a React 19 pattern and get React 16 code. You ask for a Next.js App Router solution and get Pages Router. Context7 addresses this directly by giving your agent access to current documentation. When it works, the improvement in code quality is immediately noticeable.

**Massive library coverage.** Thousands of libraries are indexed, covering the major web frameworks, databases, cloud SDKs, and tooling libraries. For mainstream development stacks, Context7 almost certainly has your libraries covered.

**Two-tool simplicity.** The resolve-then-query pattern is clean and predictable. Agents learn it quickly, and there are no complex configuration options to get wrong. Compare this to Exa's 9 tools or Playwright's 25+ — Context7 is deliberately minimal.

**Broad client support.** Works with Cursor, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, VS Code Copilot, Windsurf, OpenCode, and 30+ other MCP-compatible clients. The `npx ctx7 setup` command handles auto-detection. This is table-stakes for adoption, and Context7 nails it.

**Active development.** 48,900 GitHub stars, 2,300 forks, regular releases. Upstash is a real company (they also build Redis and Kafka-as-a-service) with an incentive to maintain this. This isn't a weekend project that'll be abandoned.

## What Doesn't Work

### The ContextCrush Vulnerability (Patched)

In February 2026, [Noma Security](https://noma.security/blog/contextcrush-context7-the-mcp-server-vulnerability/) discovered a critical vulnerability they named "ContextCrush." Context7's "Custom Rules" feature allowed library publishers to set "AI Instructions" that were served directly to AI agents — with no sanitization.

The attack worked in three steps:
1. Anyone could register and publish a library to Context7's registry (open registration)
2. Custom rules were delivered unfiltered through the MCP server
3. AI agents interpreted these rules as trusted instructions and executed them using their own tool access (file operations, bash, network)

Noma demonstrated a proof-of-concept that read `.env` files, exfiltrated credentials via GitHub Issues, and deleted files — all triggered by an agent querying a poisoned library.

**The core issue:** Context7 serves as both the registry (where anyone can publish) and the trusted delivery mechanism (pushing content into the agent's context). That dual role creates an inherent trust problem.

Upstash patched this within two days of notification (disclosed Feb 18, fixed Feb 23, published March 5, 2026). But the architectural question remains: any centralized documentation registry that feeds directly into AI agent context is a tempting attack surface. The patch adds sanitization, but the trust model — community-contributed docs delivered as trusted context — is inherent to the design.

### Free Tier Gutted (January 2026)

In January 2026, Context7 [quietly reduced](https://blog.devgenius.io/context7-quietly-slashed-its-free-tier-by-92-16fa05ddce03) the free tier from ~6,000 to 1,000 requests per month. That's an 83% cut. Users also reported it dropping as low as 500 requests with a 60 requests/hour rate limit — a 92% reduction.

For a tool that triggers on virtually every code-related prompt (when the agent decides it needs documentation), 1,000 requests/month can evaporate fast. Multiple developers reported hitting the limit within the first week, at which point their agent falls back to hallucinating outdated patterns — the exact problem Context7 exists to solve.

After hitting the monthly cap, you get 20 bonus requests per day until the month resets. The Pro tier costs $10/seat/month for 5,000 requests, with overage at $10 per 1,000 additional calls.

This isn't unreasonable for a commercial product — but the *way* it happened (quiet reduction, no advance notice, no grandfathering) eroded trust. When your AI agent suddenly starts hallucinating again mid-session because you've exhausted your invisible quota, that's a bad developer experience.

### Documentation Quality Is Unverified

Context7's registry is community-contributed. Their own disclaimer: "Context7 projects are community-contributed and while we strive to maintain high quality, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or security of all library documentation."

This means:
- Documentation may be outdated despite the "always current" marketing
- Coverage varies — popular libraries are well-indexed, niche ones may have gaps
- There's no automated verification that docs match the actual library source
- The "Report" button is the primary quality control mechanism

For a tool whose value proposition is "no more outdated docs," the reliance on community curation introduces the same staleness risk it claims to eliminate — just at a different layer.

### Connection Issues Across Platforms

With 129 open GitHub issues, connection problems are a recurring theme:
- **Windows:** timeout errors on startup, `spawn context7-mcp ENOENT` errors
- **Windsurf:** adding a local Context7 MCP can break all other MCP servers (refresh loop)
- **Claude Desktop:** persistent "Not connected" errors despite correct configuration
- **Self-hosted:** authentication errors when using custom API keys

These are the growing pains of rapid adoption — more clients means more edge cases. But for a tool with 240K weekly npm downloads, the reliability should be higher.

## Pricing

| Plan | Cost | Monthly Requests | Overage | Private Repos |
|------|------|-----------------|---------|--------------|
| Free | $0 | 1,000 (+20/day bonus after cap) | — | No |
| Pro | $10/seat/month | 5,000/seat | $10 per 1,000 | Yes ($25 per 1M tokens) |
| Enterprise | Custom | 5,000/seat | $10 per 1,000 | Yes ($25 per 1M tokens) |

Enterprise adds SOC-2/GDPR compliance, SSO, self-hosted deployment, and dedicated support.

## Compared To

### Docfork
Open-source (MIT), covers 9,000+ libraries, and its standout feature is "Cabinets" — project-specific context isolation that locks your agent to a verified dependency stack. This prevents context poisoning from unrelated libraries. No rate limits. The trade-off: smaller community, less mainstream adoption.

### GitMCP
Free, open-source, remote MCP server that turns any GitHub repository into a documentation source by reading `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, and README files. No signup, no API key, no downloads. The trade-off: it reads raw repo docs, not curated/structured documentation. Works best for well-documented repos.

### Deepcon
Claims 90% accuracy in contextual benchmarks vs. Context7's 65% (tested across 20 real-world scenarios). Token-efficient (~1,000 tokens per response). Supports Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and Rust. Newer and less proven at scale.

### Nia
Improves Cursor's performance by 27% (their benchmark) by indexing documentation and codebases. Focuses on coding agent augmentation beyond just documentation retrieval.

### llms.txt Standard
Not an MCP server, but a relevant alternative approach. The [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) proposal standardizes how libraries expose documentation for AI consumption. If widely adopted, it would make centralized registries like Context7 less necessary — your agent could fetch docs directly from the library's site. Growing adoption but not yet universal.

## Who Should Use This

**Use Context7 if:**
- You work with mainstream libraries (React, Next.js, Django, etc.) where Context7 has strong coverage
- You want zero-config documentation injection — just install and go
- The free tier (1,000 requests/month) is sufficient for your workflow, or $10/month for Pro is acceptable
- You're comfortable with the centralized registry trust model

**Consider alternatives if:**
- You're security-conscious about what gets injected into your agent's context (look at Docfork's Cabinets feature)
- You work primarily with niche or internal libraries (Context7's community-contributed model may not cover them)
- You need unlimited free usage (look at GitMCP or Docfork)
- You want to self-host your documentation source (look at GitMCP or the llms.txt standard)

## The Verdict

Context7 solves a real problem — AI agents need current documentation to stop hallucinating outdated APIs. The two-tool design is clean, setup is painless, and library coverage for mainstream stacks is good. There's a reason it's the most popular MCP server of 2026.

But the centralized registry model creates risks that the alternatives avoid. The ContextCrush vulnerability (patched) demonstrated that any system delivering community-contributed content directly into agent context is an attack surface. The free tier cut (1,000 requests/month, down from ~6,000) pushes active developers toward the $10/month Pro plan. And the community-contributed documentation, while extensive, has no automated verification against source — undermining the "always current" promise.

The rating: **3.5 out of 5.** Context7 is the most accessible documentation MCP server available. The problem it solves is genuine, the execution is mostly good, and the adoption numbers are real. But the security history, aggressive monetization shift, and unverified documentation quality prevent it from scoring higher. Developers who care about supply chain security should look at Docfork or GitMCP; developers who need unlimited free usage have better options.

For a tool that 240,000 developers use weekly, 3.5 might seem low. But popularity isn't quality — it's distribution. Context7 got the distribution right. The quality needs to catch up.
