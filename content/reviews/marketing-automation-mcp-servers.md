MailerLite provides an official MCP server requiring no API keys — it handles subscriber management, campaign creation, and automation workflows directly. ActiveCampaign and Brevo both have official MCP servers available for Claude Desktop and Cursor integration. LokiMCPUniverse/mailchimp-mcp-server and bryangsmith/MailchimpMCP provide Mailchimp access with campaign management and automation control. **HubSpot has the richest CRM integration** — peakmojo/mcp-hubspot (72 stars, Python) goes beyond basic API access with FAISS vector storage for semantic search across previous interactions, SentenceTransformer embeddings with automatic caching, and duplicate prevention on contact creation. shinzo-labs/hubspot-mcp provides comprehensive API coverage. calypsoCodex/hubspot-mcp-extended offers 106 tools generated from HubSpot's official OpenAPI specs covering contacts, companies, deals, tickets, quotes, products, invoices, and line items. yespark/mcp-hubspot provides 40+ tools for CRM, marketing, and sales automation via REST API. The official HubSpot MCP Server is now in public beta at developers.hubspot.com/mcp. **Ad platform MCP servers are surprisingly mature** — pipeboard-co/meta-ads-mcp (601 stars, Python) is the most popular marketing MCP server overall, providing full campaign lifecycle management for Facebook and Instagram ads including campaign creation, budget updates, ad duplication, performance analytics, audience targeting, and creative optimization. It works with any MCP client. brijr/meta-mcp offers similar functionality with emphasis on creative optimization. google-marketing-solutions/google_ads_mcp is the official Google implementation — Python-based, Apache-2.0 licensed, currently read-only for diagnostics and analytics. cohnen/mcp-google-ads connects Google Ads with Claude AI for natural language campaign analysis. TrueClicks/google-ads-mcp-js is notable for not requiring developer tokens or OAuth credentials — easiest setup. **SEO tools have strong community adoption** — AminForou/mcp-gsc (512 stars, Python) is the most popular SEO MCP server, connecting Google Search Console to AI assistants for natural language SEO analysis including query performance, page analytics, and search appearance data. cnych/seo-mcp (165 stars) provides free SEO analysis based on Ahrefs data including backlink analysis, keyword research, and traffic estimation.

LokiMCPUniverse/hootsuite-mcp-server integrates with Hootsuite for social media management. mattcoatsworth/Klaviyo-MCP-Server provides comprehensive Klaviyo integration for profiles, lists, segments, campaigns, flows, templates, and catalogs — Klaviyo also offers an official MCP server at developers.klaviyo.com. **Gaps remain in cross-platform orchestration** — no MCP server provides a unified marketing dashboard aggregating data across email, ads, SEO, and social. No dedicated A/B testing orchestrator exists. Affiliate marketing, influencer management, and marketing attribution are not covered. The category would benefit from a 'marketing ops' MCP that connects campaign data across platforms for unified reporting."

## What's Missing

The marketing automation MCP ecosystem has notable **gaps**:

- **No unified marketing dashboard** — no MCP aggregates data across email, ads, SEO, and social into a single interface
- **No A/B testing orchestrator** — individual platforms support A/B tests, but no MCP coordinates testing across channels
- **Limited cross-platform analytics** — no marketing attribution MCP connecting touchpoints across platforms
- **No affiliate marketing MCP** — affiliate networks (ShareASale, CJ, Impact) are not covered
- **No influencer management** — no MCP for influencer discovery, outreach, or campaign tracking
- **Limited marketing automation workflows** — platforms like Marketo, Pardot, and Marketing Cloud lack MCP servers
- **No content calendar MCP** — no unified content planning tool across channels

## Bottom Line

The marketing automation MCP category is **surprisingly strong at 4/5** — driven by high-quality ad platform MCPs (Meta Ads at 601 stars, official Google Ads), excellent SEO tooling (Google Search Console at 512 stars), and broad email marketing coverage with multiple official MCPs from major platforms. HubSpot's ecosystem is particularly rich with vector search capabilities and 106-tool comprehensive coverage. The main weakness is cross-platform orchestration — each platform has good individual MCPs, but no server ties them together for unified marketing operations. Social media management MCPs are functional but less mature than the ad and email categories.
