card_description: "Interior design and architecture MCP servers for CAD control, BIM automation, 3D modeling, and parametric design through AI assistants. This is one of the strongest MCP categories by star count — **Blender MCP alone has 17.6k stars**, making it one of the most popular MCP servers across all categories. The space is dominated by established professional CAD/3D tools getting MCP integrations rather than purpose-built design servers. **Every major CAD platform now has at least one MCP server** — AutoCAD, FreeCAD, SketchUp, Rhino/Grasshopper, Revit, Fusion 360, and OpenSCAD all have working implementations. **Rhino/Grasshopper stands out with 5+ independent servers**, reflecting the computational design community's enthusiasm for AI-assisted parametric modeling. **FreeCAD has the most feature-rich server** with proximile/FreeCAD-MCP offering 57 tools, Docker headless execution, Vision AI analysis, and even image-to-3D generation via TRELLIS.2. **The AutoCAD ecosystem is surprisingly mature** — puran-water/autocad-mcp provides freehand AutoLISP execution with a 600+ symbol P&ID library, while multiCAD-mcp supports 4 different CAD platforms with 46 tools. **Revit is the only major BIM platform with MCP support**, enabling AI-driven building information modeling with CRUD operations on architectural elements. **The biggest gap is interior design itself** — despite the category name, there are no dedicated servers for room layout, furniture placement, color palette generation, material browsing, or the decorating workflow. All servers focus on the technical CAD/modeling side rather than the design decision-making process. Similarly, rendering engines (V-Ray, Lumion, Enscape), landscape architecture, and building code compliance are entirely absent. The category earns 4/5 — exceptional depth in CAD/3D modeling tools with strong community adoption, but the interior design and architectural workflow side is almost entirely missing."

Interior design and architecture MCP servers connect AI agents to CAD software, BIM platforms, 3D modelers, and design tools. Instead of manually navigating complex CAD interfaces or switching between modeling applications, these servers let you create, modify, and analyze designs through natural language via the Model Context Protocol.

This review covers **CAD control, BIM automation, 3D modeling, and architectural design tools** — AutoCAD, FreeCAD, Blender, SketchUp, Rhino/Grasshopper, Revit, Fusion 360, and OpenSCAD. For general-purpose 3D file processing, see our [3D Printing review](/reviews/3d-printing-mcp-servers/) if available.

The headline findings: **Blender MCP is the star of the category with 17.6k GitHub stars** — one of the most popular MCP servers in existence. **Every major CAD platform now has MCP support**, from AutoCAD to Rhino to Revit. **Rhino/Grasshopper has the most implementations** with 5+ independent servers reflecting the computational design community's enthusiasm. **FreeCAD-MCP offers 57 tools** including Docker headless execution and AI-powered 3D generation. **The glaring gap is actual interior design** — room layout, furniture placement, and color palette tools don't exist yet.

## Blender

### ahujasid/blender-mcp — The Most Popular MCP Server for 3D

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [blender-mcp](https://github.com/ahujasid/blender-mcp) | 17,600+ | Python | — | 18+ |

**The dominant Blender-to-AI bridge with massive community adoption:**

- **Two-way communication** — connects Claude AI to Blender through a socket-based server
- **Object manipulation** — create, modify, and delete 3D objects with natural language
- **Material control** — apply and modify materials and colors
- **Scene inspection** — get detailed information about the current Blender scene
- **Geometry nodes** — status query, node info retrieval, node network creation
- **Asset libraries** — Polyhaven categories/search/download, Sketchfab model search/preview/download
- **AI 3D generation** — Hyper3D/Hunyuan3D model generation, polling, and import
- **Viewport screenshots** — capture and share what Blender is rendering
- **Code execution** — run arbitrary Python code in Blender from Claude

At 17.6k stars, this is one of the most popular MCP servers across all categories, period. The breadth of integrations — from Polyhaven assets to Hyper3D generation — makes it genuinely useful for both hobbyists and professionals.

### seehiong/blender-mcp-n8n — Blender via n8n Automation

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [blender-mcp-n8n](https://github.com/seehiong/blender-mcp-n8n) | — | — | — | 45+ |

**Automates Blender 3D modeling from n8n workflows:**

- **45+ tools** for modeling, materials, lighting, rendering, and animation
- **n8n integration** — trigger Blender operations from automation workflows
- **Comprehensive coverage** — goes beyond basic object creation into lighting and rendering

An interesting approach that connects Blender to the broader automation ecosystem rather than just direct AI chat.

## AutoCAD

### puran-water/autocad-mcp — AutoLISP Execution and P&ID Symbols

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|

**The most mature AutoCAD MCP server with industrial features:**

- **Freehand AutoLISP execution** — turns the server from a fixed command set into an extensible automation platform
- **8 consolidated tools** — drawing, undo/redo, file operations

The biggest gap in this category is **interior design itself**. Despite the strong CAD/3D modeling coverage, there are no MCP servers for:

- **Room layout and space planning** — no automated furniture placement, no traffic flow analysis
- **Floor plan generation** — no text-to-floor-plan tools
- **Color palette and material selection** — no integration with paint brands, fabric libraries, or finish catalogs
- **Furniture catalogs** — no IKEA, Wayfair, Pottery Barn, or other retailer APIs
- **AR/VR visualization** — no augmented reality room preview tools
- **Rendering engines** — no V-Ray, Lumion, Enscape, or KeyShot MCP servers
- **Landscape architecture** — no garden design, hardscape planning, or plant databases
- **Building code compliance** — no zoning, ADA, or fire code checking
- **Lighting design** — no illumination calculations or fixture selection
- **Acoustics** — no room acoustic analysis or soundproofing recommendations
- **Structural engineering** — no load calculations or structural analysis
- **Cost estimation** — no material quantity takeoffs or budget planning
- **SolidWorks** — the most widely used professional mechanical CAD has no established MCP server
- **Onshape** — the cloud-native CAD platform lacks MCP integration

---

## Bottom Line

The interior design and architecture MCP server category is **exceptionally strong on the CAD/3D modeling side** but almost completely empty on the design decision-making side. If you need AI-controlled CAD — Blender, AutoCAD, FreeCAD, SketchUp, Rhino, Revit, or Fusion 360 — you have excellent options with active development and significant community adoption. Blender MCP at 17.6k stars is among the most popular MCP servers in existence, and the Rhino/Grasshopper ecosystem has 5+ independent implementations showing genuine demand from the computational design community.

But if you're looking for AI-assisted interior design — "help me arrange furniture in my living room" or "suggest a color palette for this bedroom" — MCP servers can't help you yet. This represents a significant opportunity: the interior design market is massive, and the gap between powerful CAD automation tools and accessible design tools is exactly where new MCP servers could add the most value.

**Rating: 4/5** — Outstanding CAD/3D tool coverage with strong community adoption. The Blender, Rhino, and AutoCAD ecosystems alone justify a high rating. Points deducted for the complete absence of interior design workflow tools, rendering engine integration, and building code compliance checking.
