**At a glance:** 49 stars, 19 forks, Apache 2.0 license, JavaScript, stdio transport, 70 MCP tools, official first-party server from Mailgun (Sinch).

Mailgun's MCP server exposes **70 tools** across the full Mailgun API surface — from sending emails and managing templates to querying analytics, tracking suppressions, and configuring IP pools. This is one of the most comprehensive single-service MCP servers we've reviewed, covering nearly every Mailgun API endpoint as a callable tool.

The [mailgun-mcp-server repository](https://github.com/mailgun/mailgun-mcp-server) has 49 GitHub stars and 19 forks. It's maintained by the Mailgun team (part of [Sinch](https://sinch.com/), which acquired Mailgun's parent company Pathwire for $1.9 billion in 2021). Mailgun processes billions of emails for ~150,000+ customers with ~$60–75M in annual revenue and 204 employees.

## What It Does

The server wraps Mailgun's REST API into 70 MCP tools organized across 11 categories. Tool names map directly to API endpoints using a `method--path` convention (e.g., `post--v3-domain_name-messages` for sending email).

### Tool Categories

| Category | Tools | What You Can Do |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| **Messaging** | 3 | Send emails, retrieve stored messages, resend |
| **Analytics** | 5 | Query logs, metrics, usage data, bounce classifications |
| **Domain Stats** | 8 | Get stats by tag, provider, device, country; aggregate data |
| **Suppressions** | 8 | View bounces, complaints, unsubscribes, allowlist entries |
| **Templates** | 8 | Create templates, manage versions, update content |
| **Domains** | 5 | List domains, verify DNS, check sending queues |
| **Mailing Lists** | 8 | Create lists, manage members, update list settings |
| **Webhooks** | 4 | View, create, update event webhooks |
| **Routes** | 3 | View and update inbound routing rules |
| **IP Management** | 6 | View IPs, pools, and domain assignments |
| **Tracking** | 4 | Configure click, open, and unsubscribe tracking |
| **Account** | 2 | Check monthly limits, view subaccount IP pools |

### Example Prompts

The README suggests use cases like:
- *"Send an email to user@example.com with the subject 'Welcome' from noreply@mydomain.com"*
- *"Show me delivery statistics for the last 7 days across all my domains"*
- *"Check which emails bounced in the last 24 hours and show me the bounce codes"*
- *"Create a new email template called 'weekly-digest' with version 'v1'"*
- *"Compare delivery rates between my US and EU domains"*

## Architecture

The server runs locally via Node.js and communicates with your MCP client over **stdio**:

```
AI Agent → MCP Client → Mailgun MCP Server (local) → Mailgun API (HTTPS)
```

Key architectural decisions:

- **No-delete design** — The server intentionally omits deletion operations. You can create and update resources but not delete them, reducing the blast radius if an AI agent acts on bad instructions.
- **Zod schema validation** — Every tool parameter is validated against Mailgun's OpenAPI specification using Zod schemas before the request reaches Mailgun's servers. This catches malformed inputs early.
- **Credential isolation** — API keys are passed as environment variables and never exposed to the LLM. The server handles authentication exclusively.
- **No logging** — No API keys, request parameters, or response data are logged locally.

## Setup

Install and run via npx:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mailgun": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mailgun/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "MAILGUN_API_KEY": "your-key",
        "MAILGUN_API_REGION": "us"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Claude Code: `claude mcp add mailgun -- npx -y @mailgun/mcp-server`

**Requirements:** Node.js v18+, active Mailgun account with API key.

**Configuration:**

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `MAILGUN_API_KEY` | Yes | — | Mailgun API authentication |
| `MAILGUN_API_REGION` | No | `us` | Regional endpoint (`us` or `eu`) |

EU region support is notable — Mailgun operates EU-based infrastructure for GDPR compliance, and the MCP server routes to the correct regional API endpoint based on this setting.

## Pricing

Mailgun MCP server is free and open source. You need a Mailgun account:

| Plan | Price/mo | Emails/mo | Key Features |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Free** | $0 | 100/day | Basic tracking, 1 domain, API access |
| **Foundation** | $35 | 50,000 | Templates, 1,000 domains, 5-day log retention |
| **Scale** | $90 | 100,000 | Dedicated IPs, 5K email validations, 30-day logs |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | 2.5M+ | Custom volume, premium support |

The free tier is capped at 100 emails per day — enough for testing the MCP server, but you'll hit it quickly in production. Foundation at $35/month is the realistic starting point for any meaningful agent workflow.

## How It Compares

| Feature | Mailgun MCP | Resend MCP | SendGrid MCP (community) | Postmark MCP (community) |
|---------|-------------|------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| **MCP Tools** | 70 | 30+ | ~59 (deyikong) | Varies |
| **Official** | Yes (Mailgun team) | Yes (Resend team) | No (community) | No (community) |
| **License** | Apache 2.0 | MIT | Varies | Varies |
| **Transport** | stdio | stdio | stdio | stdio |
| **Delete Operations** | No (safety) | Yes | Configurable | Varies |
| **Schema Validation** | Zod (OpenAPI) | TypeScript | Varies | Varies |
| **Free Tier** | 100/day | 3,000/mo | 100/day | 100/mo |
| **EU Region** | Yes | No | No | EU available |
| **Parent Company** | Sinch ($1.9B acq) | Independent ($3.1M seed) | Twilio | ActiveCampaign |

**vs. Resend MCP:** Resend has fewer tools (30+ vs 70) but covers a broader product surface including contacts, audiences, broadcasts, and segments — features Mailgun handles outside the API. Resend's developer experience is more modern (TypeScript-native, cleaner API design), and its free tier (3,000 emails/month) is significantly more generous. Mailgun wins on raw API coverage depth, EU compliance infrastructure, and enterprise maturity.

**vs. SendGrid MCP (community):** SendGrid has no official MCP server. The best community option (deyikong/sendgrid-mcp) offers ~59 tools with a read-only safety mode. Mailgun's official support means better maintenance guarantees and alignment with API changes. SendGrid's free tier (100 emails/day) matches Mailgun's.

**vs. individual email tools:** For teams already on Mailgun, this server provides comprehensive coverage without building custom integrations. But if you only need email sending, simpler MCP servers (or even Pipedream's Mailgun integration) may be less overhead.

## What to Watch Out For

**No client-side rate limiting.** Every MCP tool call translates directly to a Mailgun API request. The server relies entirely on Mailgun's server-side rate limits. An eager AI agent could exhaust your API quota quickly.

**Tool naming is opaque.** Tool names like `post--v3-domain_name-messages` and `get--v3-domain_name-bounces-address` are auto-generated from the API spec. While functional, they're harder for LLMs to reason about than descriptive names like `send_email` or `get_bounces`. This can lead to tool selection confusion in complex workflows.

**Small community.** 49 stars, 19 forks, 11 commits, and only 2 open issues. The repository is officially maintained by Mailgun, but community engagement is minimal. Bug reports and feature requests may take time to get addressed.

**Validation depends on OpenAPI spec accuracy.** Zod schemas are generated from Mailgun's OpenAPI specification. If the spec is incomplete or outdated (which happens), some edge-case parameters may fall back to permissive validation, letting invalid requests through to Mailgun's server-side validation.

**Webhook URLs aren't validated locally.** When creating or updating webhooks, the server passes arbitrary URLs to Mailgun without local validation. This is a minor security consideration — Mailgun validates on its end, but a prompt injection attack could potentially set webhook URLs to attacker-controlled endpoints.

**Companion Mailjet server exists but is tiny.** Mailgun also maintains [mailjet-mcp-server](https://github.com/mailgun/mailjet-mcp-server) (10 stars, 1 contributor) for Mailjet's API (Mailjet is also owned by Sinch). It covers contacts, campaigns, segmentation, and stats but is much earlier in development.

## The Bottom Line

Mailgun's MCP server is a **solid, safety-conscious official integration** that exposes nearly the entire Mailgun API surface as MCP tools. The no-delete design, Zod validation, and credential isolation make it one of the more thoughtfully secured MCP servers we've reviewed. With 70 tools across 11 categories, it covers everything from basic email sending to advanced analytics, IP management, and bounce classification.

The trade-off is in developer experience. Auto-generated tool names are harder for LLMs to parse than hand-crafted ones, the community is small despite official backing, and the free tier's 100 emails/day limit makes meaningful testing difficult. If you're already a Mailgun customer, this server gives your AI agents comprehensive access to your email infrastructure. If you're choosing an email platform for AI-native workflows, Resend's cleaner API and more generous free tier may be a better starting point.

**Rating: 3.5/5** — Comprehensive API coverage (70 tools) with thoughtful security design (no-delete, Zod validation, credential isolation); loses half a point each for opaque auto-generated tool names, minimal community engagement despite official status, and restrictive free tier.
