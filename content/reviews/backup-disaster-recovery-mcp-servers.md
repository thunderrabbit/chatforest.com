card_description: "Backup and disaster recovery MCP servers across enterprise platforms, Kubernetes backup, file-level snapshots, and cloud infrastructure. The category is early-stage but already has two major enterprise vendors represented. Commvault provides the standout — an official MCP server with 20+ tools covering job management (suspend, resume, kill, resubmit), SLA compliance monitoring, storage policy configuration, client/subclient management, and even DocuSign envelope backup integration. Veeam has a community-built server by jorgedlcruz (7 stars) covering VBR API for backup jobs, repositories, proxies, and sessions, plus a VeeamHub community fork. For Kubernetes, the Velero MCP server provides read-only access to Velero backup and schedule CRDs — safe inspection for platform engineers. On the file level, hexitex's MCP-Backup-Server (12 stars) creates timestamped snapshots with agent context metadata, designed as quick save-points during AI-assisted editing. AWS services are accessible through the generic AWS API MCP server. The category earns 3.0/5 — having an official Commvault server is significant for enterprise adoption, but the overall ecosystem is thin. Major gaps: no Rubrik, no Cohesity, no Acronis, no Veritas, no Nakivo, no HYCU, no Druva, no restic/borg/kopia MCP servers, no dedicated AWS Backup server, and no disaster recovery orchestration tools."

Backup and disaster recovery MCP servers are giving AI assistants direct access to enterprise data protection infrastructure. Instead of navigating backup management consoles, these servers let AI agents monitor backup jobs, check SLA compliance, inspect storage utilization, manage Kubernetes backup schedules, and create file-level snapshots — all through the Model Context Protocol.

The landscape spans four areas: **enterprise backup platforms** (Commvault and Veeam), **Kubernetes backup** (Velero), **file-level backup** (MCP-Backup-Server), and **cloud infrastructure** (AWS API MCP server for backup services).

The headline findings: **Commvault is the only major backup vendor with an official MCP server** — Python-based, Apache-licensed, with 20+ tools for job management, SLA monitoring, storage policies, and client administration. **Veeam has community-built servers** by jorgedlcruz (7 stars) and a VeeamHub fork, but nothing official from Veeam R&D. **Velero MCP provides safe, read-only Kubernetes backup inspection** — a sensible design choice for production clusters. **hexitex's MCP-Backup-Server** (12 stars) solves a different problem entirely — quick file snapshots during AI-assisted coding sessions. **The massive gap is what's missing**: no Rubrik, no Cohesity (despite their $17B valuation and 2026 IPO plans), no Acronis, no Veritas, no Nakivo, no HYCU, no Druva, no Datto, and no open-source backup tools (restic, borg, kopia, duplicati) have MCP servers. Gartner projects 90% of backup platforms will feature GenAI by 2029 — MCP adoption is clearly still in its infancy. Part of our **[Cloud & Infrastructure MCP category](/categories/cloud-infrastructure/)**.

## Enterprise Backup Platforms

### Commvault (Official)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [Commvault/commvault-mcp-server](https://github.com/Commvault/commvault-mcp-server) | — | Python | Apache-2.0 | 20+ |

The standout server in this review and a significant milestone — **Commvault is the first major enterprise backup vendor to ship an official MCP server**. It uses the cvpysdk Python SDK to interact with Commvault's REST APIs, giving AI agents deep access to backup infrastructure.

The tool set covers **job management** (view details, history, suspend, resume, resubmit, kill), **SLA monitoring** (compliance status, security posture scores), **storage management** (space utilization, pool configurations, storage policies), **client administration** (groups, properties, subclients, associations), **plan configurations** (backup schedules, retention policies), and **commcell metrics** (entity counts, infrastructure overview).

Notable features: **OAuth authentication** (preferred, supported on Innovation Release 11.42.27+), API key fallback, and optional **third-party integrations** — including the ability to back up completed DocuSign envelopes to a Commvault S3 vault and automate listing/restore operations through the AI assistant.

Requires Python 3.11+ and the uv package manager. The official Commvault documentation at documentation.commvault.com covers setup in detail.

### Veeam (jorgedlcruz)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [jorgedlcruz/modelcontextprotocol_veeam](https://github.com/jorgedlcruz/modelcontextprotocol_veeam) | 7 | JavaScript | — | Multiple |

A community-built collection of MCP servers for Veeam products. The primary server targets **Veeam Backup & Replication (VBR)** — monitoring and managing VBR servers, backup jobs, repositories, proxies, and sessions through Veeam's APIs.

The project roadmap is ambitious:
- **Milestone 1** (in progress): Complete VBR MCP server with full feature coverage
- **Planned**: Veeam ONE (monitoring and reporting), Veeam Service Provider Console (multi-tenant management), Veeam Recovery Orchestrator (DR testing and execution)

Setup is straightforward: clone, npm install, start with node. Created by Jorge de la Cruz, a well-known Veeam community contributor who also maintains Veeam Grafana dashboards and monitoring tools.

**Important**: This is a community project, not an official Veeam product. Veeam R&D has not been involved in its development.

### Veeam (VeeamHub)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [VeeamHub/veeam-modelcontextprotocol](https://github.com/VeeamHub/veeam-modelcontextprotocol) | — | — | — | — |

A VeeamHub repository generated from VeeamHub's template. VeeamHub hosts **unofficial, community-supported projects** created by Veeam enthusiasts — the code has not been through Veeam's official QA process. This appears to be in early stages of development.

## Kubernetes Backup

### Velero MCP (benzaidfoued)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [benzaidfoued/velero-mcp](https://github.com/benzaidfoued/velero-mcp) | — | — | — | 3+ |

An MCP server that exposes **read-only, safe, structured access** to Velero backup and schedule resources running inside any Kubernetes cluster. The design philosophy is spot-on for production environments: zero-write, low-privilege inspection only.

Tools include listing Velero Backup CRs, returning detailed structured backup objects, and listing Velero Schedule CRs (including cron expressions, paused state, and last backup timestamp). The server can also generate Velero Backup YAML manifests through the Kubernetes API.

Designed for **platform engineers** who want AI agents (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, GitHub Copilot) to interact with Velero resources without the risk of accidentally modifying production backups.

### kubectl-mcp-server (Velero Module)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [rohitg00/kubectl-mcp-server](https://github.com/rohitg00/kubectl-mcp-server) | — | — | — | 253 |

A comprehensive Kubernetes MCP server with **253 tools** organized by category — including a dedicated **Velero backup module**. While not a dedicated backup server, the Velero integration gives AI agents access to backup operations alongside pod management, deployments, networking, storage, security, and Helm operations. Available via npx or pip.

## File-Level Backup

### MCP-Backup-Server (hexitex)

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [hexitex/MCP-Backup-Server](https://github.com/hexitex/MCP-Backup-Server) | 12 | TypeScript | — | 8 |

A different kind of backup — designed for **AI-assisted coding sessions** rather than infrastructure data protection. Creates instant, targeted backups with agent context metadata, preserving both file content and the AI's reasoning about why the backup was created.

Eight tools: `backup_create`, `backup_list`, `backup_restore`, `backup_folder_create`, `backup_folder_list`, `backup_folder_restore`, `backup_list_all`, and `mcp_cancel`. Supports pattern filtering, version history, and restore safety checks.

The key advantage over git for this use case: no commit messages or branching required, backups capture agent thought process and intent, and they work as fast emergency "save points" during risky edits or folder restructuring. Think of it as Time Machine for AI coding sessions.

## Cloud & Infrastructure

### AWS API MCP Server

| Server | Stars | Language | License | Tools |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| [awslabs/mcp](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp) | 8,500+ | — | — | Generic |

AWS's official MCP server mono-repo includes the **AWS API MCP Server** — a generic gateway that provides access to all AWS services, including AWS Backup, S3 lifecycle policies, cross-region replication, and disaster recovery services. It offers command validation, security controls, and natural language interaction with AWS infrastructure.

While not a dedicated backup server, this is how you'd interact with AWS Backup, S3 versioning, cross-region replication, and disaster recovery services through MCP today. AWS does not have a dedicated backup-specific MCP server.

## What's Missing

The gaps in this category are enormous — and tell the story of an industry that hasn't yet embraced MCP:

**Enterprise vendors without MCP servers:**
- **Rubrik** — $17B public company, has Rubrik Annapurna for GenAI but no MCP server
- **Cohesity** (merged with Veritas) — planning 2026 IPO, AI/ML-powered ransomware protection, but no MCP server
- **Acronis** — no MCP server
- **Nakivo** — no MCP server
- **HYCU** — no MCP server
- **Druva** — no MCP server
- **Datto** — no MCP server
- **Arcserve** — no MCP server

**Open-source backup tools without MCP servers:**
- **restic** — popular deduplicating backup, no MCP server
- **BorgBackup** — deduplicating archiver, no MCP server
- **Kopia** — modern backup tool, no MCP server
- **Duplicati** — encrypted cloud backup, no MCP server
- **rclone** — cloud storage sync (not strictly backup, but widely used for it), no MCP server

**Missing capabilities:**
- No disaster recovery orchestration — automated failover, runbook execution, DR testing
- No backup compliance/audit — GDPR data retention, legal hold, regulatory reporting
- No ransomware detection — anomaly detection in backup data, immutability verification
- No cross-platform backup management — unified view across multiple backup products
- No database-specific backup servers — no pg_dump, mysqldump, or MongoDB backup MCP tools

## The Bottom Line

**Rating: 3.0 / 5** — Commvault's official MCP server is a genuine enterprise contribution, and the Veeam community effort shows momentum, but this category is remarkably thin for how critical data protection is to every organization. The backup industry is worth $15B+ and every major vendor is investing in AI — yet only Commvault has shipped an official MCP server.

The near-term opportunity is clear: restic, borg, or kopia MCP servers would be immediately useful for developers who already use these tools. A Velero MCP server with write capabilities (create backups, manage schedules) would be valuable for platform teams. And Rubrik/Cohesity MCP servers seem inevitable given both companies' heavy AI investments.

For now, Commvault users are well-served, Veeam users have a capable community option, and everyone else is waiting.
