**At a glance:** 2,200+ stars, 287 forks, MIT license, v2.7.1 (March 2026), TypeScript, hosted + local modes, 60+ tools in Pro mode, free tier (5,000 req/month).

Most web scraping MCP servers work great — until the target site fights back. CAPTCHAs, IP blocks, fingerprint detection, geo-restrictions: these are the problems that [Bright Data's MCP Server](https://github.com/brightdata/brightdata-mcp) was built to solve. It wraps Bright Data's enterprise proxy infrastructure (150 million+ residential IPs worldwide) into a standard MCP interface, so your AI agent can access virtually any public website without getting blocked.

The benchmark results back this up. In [independent testing by AIMultiple](https://aimultiple.com/browser-mcp), Bright Data achieved **100% success rate** on web search and extraction tasks — the only server to hit perfect accuracy. In a 250-concurrent-agent stress test, it led all competitors with a **76.8% success rate** at 48.7 seconds average completion time.

The key question: is a paid enterprise platform justified when free alternatives like [Fetch MCP](/reviews/fetch-mcp-server/) and [Crawl4AI](/reviews/web-scraping-crawling-mcp-servers/#crawl4ai) handle most use cases without cost?

## What It Does

Bright Data MCP operates in three modes, each exposing different tool sets:

### Rapid Mode (Free Tier — Default)

Two tools that cover the most common agent needs:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **search_engine** | Web search via Bright Data's SERP API — returns structured results |
| **scrape_as_markdown** | Fetch any URL, bypass anti-bot protection, return clean Markdown |

Also available: `search_engine_batch` and `scrape_batch` for parallel operations.

These handle JavaScript-rendered pages, auto-solve CAPTCHAs, and route through proxies automatically. 5,000 requests/month free — enough to prototype and test.

### Pro Mode (Paid)

Set `PRO_MODE=true` to unlock 60+ specialized scrapers organized by vertical:

| Group | Example Tools | What They Extract |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| **ecommerce** | Amazon, Walmart, Google Shopping scrapers | Product data, prices, reviews, seller info |
| **social** | LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube, Instagram scrapers | Profiles, posts, comments, channel data |
| **finance** | Yahoo Finance scrapers | Stock data, financial metrics |
| **business** | Crunchbase, ZoomInfo, Zillow scrapers | Company data, contacts, real estate listings |
| **research** | GitHub, Reuters scrapers | Repository data, news articles |
| **app_stores** | Google Play, Apple App Store scrapers | App metadata, reviews, rankings |
| **travel** | Booking.com scrapers | Hotel data, pricing, availability |
| **geo** | ChatGPT, Grok, Perplexity queries | AI-generated answers, brand mention tracking |
| **browser** | Scraping Browser automation | Full remote browser control for agents |
| **advanced_scraping** | AI extraction, batch ops | Structured data extraction with schemas |

Each vertical scraper returns **structured JSON** rather than raw HTML or Markdown — the agent gets clean, typed data without parsing.

### Custom Mode

Use `GROUPS` and `TOOLS` environment variables to whitelist exactly the tools you need. This keeps the tool list manageable (important since 60+ tools eat context window) and limits costs to specific verticals.

## How It Works

The architecture is straightforward: your MCP client sends requests to Bright Data's server, which routes them through the appropriate infrastructure:

1. **Web Unlocker** — anti-bot bypass for protected sites (CAPTCHAs, Cloudflare, DataDome)
2. **SERP API** — structured search engine results
3. **Web Scraper API** — pre-built scrapers returning structured data
4. **Scraping Browser** — full remote browser for interactive pages

All requests pass through Bright Data's proxy network, which provides automatic IP rotation, geo-targeting, and fingerprint management. The agent doesn't need to think about any of this — it just calls `scrape_as_markdown("https://example.com")` and gets clean content back.

## Setup

**Hosted mode** (recommended — zero local setup):

Add to your MCP client config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Bright Data": {
      "url": "https://mcp.brightdata.com/mcp?token=YOUR_API_TOKEN"
    }
  }
}
```

**Local mode** via npx:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Bright Data": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@brightdata/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_TOKEN": "YOUR_API_TOKEN",
        "PRO_MODE": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `API_TOKEN` | Authentication (required) | — |
| `PRO_MODE` | Enable all 60+ tools | `false` |
| `RATE_LIMIT` | Custom request throttling | Unlimited |
| `GROUPS` | Whitelist tool groups | All (in Pro) |
| `TOOLS` | Whitelist specific tools | All (in group) |
| `POLLING_TIMEOUT` | Structured scraper timeout | 600s |
| `BASE_TIMEOUT` | Search/scrape timeout | No limit |
| `BASE_MAX_RETRIES` | Retry attempts | 0 |
| `WEB_UNLOCKER_ZONE` | Custom proxy zone | `mcp_unlocker` |
| `BROWSER_ZONE` | Browser proxy zone | `mcp_browser` |

## Benchmark Performance

Independent benchmarks from [AIMultiple's MCP stress test](https://aimultiple.com/browser-mcp) put Bright Data at the top:

### Web Search & Extraction Accuracy

| Server | Success Rate | Avg Speed | Scalability (250 agents) |
|--------|-------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Bright Data** | **100%** | 30s | **76.8%** |
| Nimble | 93% | 16s | 51.2% |
| Firecrawl | 83% | 7s | 64.8% |
| Apify | 78% | 32s | 18.8% |
| Oxylabs | 75% | 14s | 54.4% |
| Tavily | 38% | 14s | 45.0% |
| Exa | 23% | 15s | — |

### Browser Automation

| Server | Success Rate | Avg Speed |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Bright Data (Pro)** | **90%** | 30s |
| Hyperbrowser | 90% | 93s |
| Browserbase | 5% | 104s |
| Apify | 0% | — |

The tradeoff is visible: Bright Data's 30-second average response time is 4x slower than Firecrawl's 7 seconds. That's the overhead of proxy routing and anti-bot bypass. For sites that don't need it, Firecrawl or Crawl4AI are faster. For sites that block everything else, Bright Data actually works.

## GEO Feature — AI Brand Monitoring

A unique capability: the `geo` tool group lets agents query **other AI platforms** (ChatGPT, Grok, Perplexity) and monitor what they say about brands, products, or topics. This is aimed at marketing teams tracking how their brand appears in AI-generated recommendations — a genuinely novel MCP use case.

## Pricing

| Tier | Cost | Includes |
|------|------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | 5,000 req/month, Rapid mode only (search + scrape) |
| **Pay-as-you-go** | Per-request pricing | Full Pro mode, all 60+ tools |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Volume discounts, dedicated support |

The free tier is genuinely usable for prototyping. No credit card required to start. Pro mode pricing varies by tool — structured scrapers cost more than basic search/scrape.

## Compared to Alternatives

| Feature | Bright Data | Firecrawl | Crawl4AI | Apify |
|---------|-------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Stars** | 2,200 | 5,800 | 39,000+ (core) | 945 |
| **Anti-bot bypass** | Enterprise-grade | Basic | None | Via Actors |
| **Free tier** | 5,000 req/month | Limited | Unlimited (self-hosted) | $5/month credits |
| **Structured data** | 60+ vertical scrapers | LLM extraction | Smart extract | 3,000+ Actors |
| **Speed** | ~30s avg | ~7s avg | Varies | ~32s avg |
| **Accuracy** | 100% | 83% | — | 78% |
| **Stress test** | 76.8% | 64.8% | — | 18.8% |
| **Browser automation** | Yes (Pro) | Yes (v2) | No | Via Actors |
| **Self-hosted** | No | Yes | Yes | Partial |
| **License** | MIT | AGPL-3.0 | Apache 2.0 | Apache 2.0 |

**Choose Bright Data when:** targets use aggressive anti-bot protection (enterprise Cloudflare, major e-commerce, financial sites), you need structured data from specific verticals, or you're running agents at scale (250+ concurrent).

**Choose Firecrawl when:** speed matters more than anti-bot capability, you want crawling and deep research features, or you prefer self-hosting.

**Choose Crawl4AI when:** budget is zero, you want full control over infrastructure, or you're scraping sites that don't block.

**Choose Apify when:** you need access to thousands of specialized scrapers across diverse data sources.

## BrowserAI MCP — The Companion Server

Bright Data also offers a separate [BrowserAI MCP server](https://github.com/brightdata/browserai-mcp) focused specifically on serverless browser automation. Where the main MCP server wraps structured scrapers and search, BrowserAI provides direct browser control through Bright Data's infrastructure. It's newer and less adopted but worth watching if you need agent-controlled browsing with anti-bot protection.

## Limitations

- **Not self-hostable** — all requests route through Bright Data's cloud infrastructure. No way to run the proxy/unlocker stack yourself
- **Response latency** — 30-second averages are acceptable but noticeably slower than direct-fetch alternatives
- **Cost at scale** — free tier is limited to 5,000 requests; Pro mode costs add up with structured scrapers
- **60+ tools flood context** — Pro mode exposes many tools; use `GROUPS`/`TOOLS` env vars to keep it manageable
- **Platform dependency** — if Bright Data's infrastructure has issues, there's no fallback
- **No offline/local option** — even local npx mode routes requests through Bright Data's servers

## The Bottom Line

**Rating: 4/5**

Bright Data MCP Server is the best option when your AI agents need to access websites that actively try to block automated access. The 100% accuracy benchmark, 76.8% stress test leadership, and enterprise proxy infrastructure are genuine differentiators — not marketing fluff.

The free tier (5,000 req/month) makes it easy to test. The 60+ Pro tools provide structured data extraction that saves agents from parsing raw HTML. And the hosted mode means zero local setup.

The downsides are real: you're locked into Bright Data's cloud, response times are 4x slower than Firecrawl, and costs scale with usage. For sites that don't fight back, simpler (and free) alternatives like [Crawl4AI](/reviews/web-scraping-crawling-mcp-servers/) or the built-in [Fetch MCP](/reviews/fetch-mcp-server/) are better choices.

But when the target site says "no" to every other scraper? Bright Data says "yes" — and that's worth paying for.
