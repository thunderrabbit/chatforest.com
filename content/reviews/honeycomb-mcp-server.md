**At a glance:** 41 GitHub stars (deprecated self-hosted repo), 12 forks, last self-hosted commit Jan 24, 2025, 14 tools (self-hosted) / expanded hosted toolset, MIT (self-hosted), OAuth 2.1 (hosted), GA since Sep 2025, all Honeycomb tiers including free, ~335 weekly npm downloads (deprecated package), Agent Skills + Automated Investigations launched Mar 2026.

Honeycomb's MCP integration lets AI agents query and analyze your observability data — traces, metrics, logs, SLOs, triggers, boards, and columns — using natural language. It's purpose-built for event-based observability, the paradigm Honeycomb pioneered, where every request generates a rich, high-cardinality event rather than pre-aggregated metrics.

There are two things to understand here. First, Honeycomb built an open-source, self-hosted MCP server at [honeycombio/honeycomb-mcp](https://github.com/honeycombio/honeycomb-mcp) — TypeScript, MIT license, 41 stars, 12 forks. Then they deprecated it in favor of a **hosted MCP server** at `mcp.honeycomb.io/mcp`, managed by Honeycomb itself. The hosted version uses OAuth 2.1, supports more clients, and doesn't require you to run anything locally. The open-source repo's last commit was January 24, 2025. All active development is on the hosted server now. As of September 2025, the hosted MCP server reached **general availability** with expanded visualization and analysis capabilities.

This is the fourth observability MCP server we've reviewed after [Sentry](/reviews/sentry-mcp-server/) (4/5), [Grafana](/reviews/grafana-mcp-server/) (4/5), and [Datadog](/reviews/datadog-mcp-server/) (4/5). Where Datadog is the full-stack enterprise play and Grafana is the open-source multi-vendor approach, Honeycomb occupies a distinct niche: deep, high-cardinality debugging for distributed systems. It's not trying to be everything — it's trying to be the best at answering "why is this slow?" and "what changed?"

## What It Does

### Hosted MCP Server (Current)

The hosted server at `mcp.honeycomb.io/mcp` (EU: `mcp.eu1.honeycomb.io/mcp`) is what Honeycomb actively maintains. It provides access to:

- Query traces, metrics, and logs via natural language
- BubbleUp analysis for investigating anomalies — Honeycomb's signature feature for finding what's different about slow or failing requests
- Monitor triggers and SLO status
- Create boards to record investigations
- Fetch single traces and raw data rows
- List teams and environments

The hosted server requires enrollment in **Honeycomb Intelligence** (enabled by a Team Owner in settings). It works with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Amazon Q Developer, and other MCP-compatible clients.

### Self-Hosted MCP Server (Deprecated)

The open-source server at [honeycombio/honeycomb-mcp](https://github.com/honeycombio/honeycomb-mcp) exposed 14 tools:

**Query & Analysis**
- `run_query` — execute analytics queries with calculations (COUNT, AVG, P95, etc.), breakdowns, filters, and time ranges
- `analyze_columns` — statistical column analysis including top values, distributions, and cardinality

**Data Management**
- `list_datasets` — enumerate available datasets with names, slugs, and descriptions
- `get_columns` — retrieve column metadata for schema exploration

**Monitoring & Alerting**
- `list_slos` — list all SLOs for a dataset
- `get_slo` — detailed SLO information retrieval
- `list_triggers` — list all triggers for a dataset
- `get_trigger` — detailed trigger information

**Visualization**
- `list_boards` — list available dashboards
- `get_board` — retrieve board configuration and queries
- `list_markers` — list event markers and annotations

**Utility**
- `list_recipients` — notification target management
- `get_trace_link` — generate trace deep links for UI navigation
- `get_instrumentation_help` — OpenTelemetry guidance for code instrumentation

The self-hosted server used **stdio transport** only, required Node.js 18+, and authenticated via Honeycomb API keys configured as environment variables (`HONEYCOMB_ENV_{NAME}_API_KEY`) supporting multi-environment setups. It included TTL-based response caching via `@stacksjs/ts-cache` and Zod schema validation for all tool inputs.

## Setup

### Hosted Server (Recommended)

**For Claude Code or Cursor (OAuth):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "honeycomb": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.honeycomb.io/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

This triggers an OAuth 2.1 browser flow — you log in, select your team, and grant permissions. No API keys to manage.

**For headless/unattended agents (API key):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "honeycomb": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.honeycomb.io/mcp",
               "--header", "Authorization: Bearer $HONEYCOMB_API_KEY"],
      "env": {"HONEYCOMB_API_KEY": "<KEY_ID>:<SECRET_KEY>"}
    }
  }
}
```

API keys are Management API Keys created in Account > Team Settings > API Keys. They require MCP and Environments read scopes; write access is needed for the `create_board` tool.

**Cursor one-click setup** is available directly from the Honeycomb docs.

### Self-Hosted Server (Deprecated)

```bash
npx -y honeycombio-honeycomb-mcp
```

Required `HONEYCOMB_ENV_{NAME}_API_KEY` environment variables. Supported Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and Goose.

## What's New (March 2026 Update)

**Hosted MCP reached GA (September 2025).** The hosted server at `mcp.honeycomb.io/mcp` is now generally available with significant capability expansion beyond the beta. New visualization types include **heatmaps and histograms** for MCP queries — agents can now generate the same visualizations available in the Honeycomb UI. The query tool has **parity with the UI**, supporting ad-hoc calculated fields, usage mode, saved queries, and chart/table visualizations. New search and filter tools help agents inspect field names, descriptions, queries, boards, and other Honeycomb metadata. Board creation via MCP is now supported. Service Map integration is available. CSV response format delivers **~40% token savings** over JSON.

**Agent Skills launched (March 2026).** Honeycomb introduced Agent Skills that automate migrations, onboarding, and production investigations. These skills enable legacy telemetry migration to OpenTelemetry, provide instrumentation guidance, and create boards, triggers, and SLOs — available now for Claude Code, Cursor, AWS DevOps Agent, and dozens of other platforms. This is a significant expansion from "query your data" to "help you set up and manage your observability."

**Automated Investigations (early access).** When an alert fires or an SLO burns, Honeycomb can now autonomously detect issues, conduct investigations, and recommend solutions using the same playbooks as experienced SREs. This is the first observability MCP server to offer autonomous incident investigation — though it's still in early access.

**Slackbot with Canvas (early access).** A new Honeycomb Slackbot brings observability into Slack with natural language queries, alert investigation, and data exploration. It provides evidence-backed analysis with Chain of Thought logic detailing tool calls and parameter adjustments. This extends Honeycomb's MCP reach beyond IDE integrations.

**Non-Anthropic model support.** The hosted MCP server now works with GPT-5 and other non-Anthropic models. Any modern MCP client supporting Streamable HTTP transport should work.

**Self-hosted repo unchanged.** The deprecated [honeycombio/honeycomb-mcp](https://github.com/honeycombio/honeycomb-mcp) remains at 41 stars, 12 forks, 15 open issues, with no commits since January 24, 2025. npm downloads for the deprecated package have dropped to ~335/week. The community alternative by kajirita2002 (2 stars, 12 tools) also shows no activity since March 2025.

**Honeycomb Metrics GA (March 2026).** Honeycomb launched generally available Metrics at $2/1,000 time series/month (promotional through June 2026). This combines time series and event-based models on a unified platform — relevant because MCP agents can now query both events and metrics through a single interface.

## What's Good

**OAuth 2.1 on the hosted server is the right call.** Honeycomb's hosted MCP server uses browser-based OAuth 2.1 for authentication — you log in, pick your team, grant scopes. No API keys sitting in config files. For interactive agents (Claude Desktop, Cursor), this is the most secure auth model in the observability MCP category. Datadog defaults to API key headers; Grafana uses service account tokens; only Sentry matches Honeycomb here on OAuth-first design.

**Available on every Honeycomb tier, including free.** Unlike the deprecated self-hosted server (which required Enterprise), the hosted MCP server works on all plans — Free (20M events/mo), Pro ($130/mo), and Enterprise. This is a significant improvement and makes Honeycomb MCP accessible for individual developers and small teams. The MCP integration itself costs nothing extra.

**BubbleUp is a genuine differentiator — now fully integrated.** BubbleUp automatically identifies what's different about a subset of events compared to the baseline. With the GA release, agents can select interesting heatmap sections or time ranges and run BubbleUp on them directly, surfacing insights like "requests from us-east-1 using gRPC with payload > 50KB are 4x slower than normal" without you specifying those dimensions. No other observability MCP server has an equivalent automated anomaly decomposition tool. This is Honeycomb's core value proposition, and it translates even better to agent workflows now that heatmap selection is supported.

**High-cardinality debugging by design.** Honeycomb stores events, not pre-aggregated metrics. This means agents can query on any combination of dimensions — user ID, request path, feature flag state, deployment version, container ID — without hitting cardinality limits that plague metric-based systems. For distributed system debugging ("why are requests from customer X slow on service Y after deploy Z?"), this is fundamentally more powerful than metric-based approaches.

**Agent Skills take instrumentation guidance further.** The `get_instrumentation_help` tool from the self-hosted server provided contextual OpenTelemetry guidance. The March 2026 Agent Skills expand this dramatically — agents can now automate legacy telemetry migration to OpenTelemetry, create boards/triggers/SLOs, and guide onboarding. This is uniquely practical: most observability MCP servers help you query data, but Honeycomb's also helps you set up, migrate, and manage your observability stack.

**Multi-region support.** Separate US and EU endpoints (`mcp.honeycomb.io` and `mcp.eu1.honeycomb.io`) address data residency requirements. Datadog has this too, but Grafana and Sentry don't offer regional MCP endpoints.

## What's Not

**The deprecation transition is still messy.** The open-source server (41 stars, 14 well-documented tools) is deprecated, but the hosted server's tool inventory still isn't publicly documented at the same granularity. The self-hosted README lists every tool with parameters and descriptions. The hosted server's documentation describes capabilities in broad terms ("query traces, metrics, and logs") without listing exact tool names and parameters. The GA announcement mentions query, trace view, column search, BubbleUp, heatmaps, histograms, board creation, and Service Map, but there's no comprehensive tool reference. Developers evaluating Honeycomb MCP still can't easily compare its capabilities against Datadog's 50+ tools or Grafana's 40+ tools.

**15 open issues on a deprecated repo — still abandoned.** The self-hosted server still has 15 unresolved issues including "Hallucinated columns" (#24), "Support more advanced querying" (#19), "Support creating SLOs" (#16), and "Hosting and exposing the server via SSE" (#17). Fourteen months after the last commit (January 2025), these issues remain open with no indication of which are addressed in the hosted server. The hallucinated columns issue is particularly concerning — agents fabricate column names that don't exist in the dataset. Agent Skills can now create SLOs, suggesting some self-hosted gaps are addressed in the hosted platform, but the mapping isn't documented.

**Rate limits are tight.** Most tools are limited to 50 calls per minute per user; `get_service_map` is capped at 10 calls per minute. For complex debugging sessions where an agent issues multiple queries iteratively (run query, analyze results, refine, re-query), 50 calls/minute can be a real constraint. Datadog and Grafana don't publish per-tool rate limits for their MCP servers.

**24-hour session timeout.** MCP agent sessions expire after 24 hours, causing agents to fail silently. Users must start a new chat to re-establish the connection. For long-running investigation workflows or overnight batch analysis, this is disruptive.

**Can't add queries to existing boards.** The MCP server can create new boards but cannot add queries to existing ones. If you have a curated investigation board, the agent can't contribute to it — you have to manually copy queries from the agent's output into the Honeycomb UI. This breaks the agent workflow for collaborative investigation.

**Automated Investigations and Slackbot are early access.** The most exciting new capabilities — autonomous incident investigation and Slack-based observability — are in early access, not GA. Availability may be limited, and features could change. Teams building workflows around these should plan for potential breaking changes.

**The `mcp-remote` bridge still adds a dependency.** The hosted server uses Streamable HTTP transport. While more MCP clients now support Streamable HTTP natively (Claude Code works directly), many clients still require `npx mcp-remote` as a bridge — adding a Node.js dependency, an npm download on first run, and another potential failure point.

**Enterprise features gated.** Service Map is Enterprise-only. SLO Reporting API is Enterprise-only. While the basic MCP integration works on Free, the most powerful analytical features require the highest tier. The free tier's 20M events/month is generous for experimentation but tight for production workloads.

**Fewer tools than competitors.** The self-hosted server had 14 tools. Even assuming the hosted server matches or slightly exceeds this, it's substantially fewer than Datadog (50+), Grafana (40+), or New Relic (35). Honeycomb's philosophy is depth over breadth — fewer tools that do more — but it means agents have less operational coverage.

## Alternatives

**[Datadog MCP Server](/reviews/datadog-mcp-server/)** (4/5) — the full-stack enterprise play with 50+ tools across 10 modular toolsets. If you need the broadest operational coverage (LLM observability, feature flags, database monitoring, synthetics), Datadog covers more surface. Honeycomb is deeper for high-cardinality event debugging; Datadog is wider for operational breadth.

**[Grafana MCP Server](/reviews/grafana-mcp-server/)** (4/5) — the open-source, multi-vendor approach with 40+ tools. Works with any Grafana-compatible backend (Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, etc.). If you want vendor independence and code auditability, Grafana is the choice. Honeycomb's event-based model is more powerful for exploration but locks you into their platform.

**[Sentry MCP Server](/reviews/sentry-mcp-server/)** (4/5) — deep error tracking with AI root cause analysis (Seer). Narrower than Honeycomb (errors only) but deeper in its niche. Sentry and Honeycomb complement each other well — Sentry for crash debugging, Honeycomb for performance investigation.

**[New Relic MCP Server](/reviews/newrelic-mcp-server/)** (4/5) — 35 tools with natural language to NRQL translation and the most generous free tier (100GB/month). More accessible than Honeycomb for traditional APM workflows. Honeycomb's event-based approach is more powerful for high-cardinality debugging, but New Relic is more approachable for general observability.

**[kajirita2002/honeycomb-mcp-server](https://github.com/kajirita2002/honeycomb-mcp-server)** — a community-maintained alternative on npm (`@kajirita2002/honeycomb-mcp-server`). 2 stars, 12 tools, last commit March 2025. If you want a self-hosted option that isn't deprecated, this exists, though it's maintained by a single developer and hasn't seen activity in a year. With the hosted server now GA and expanding rapidly, the case for community self-hosted alternatives is weaker than ever.

## Who Should Use This

**Use Honeycomb MCP if:**
- You're already on Honeycomb and want AI agents to query your observability data
- You do high-cardinality debugging on distributed systems — Honeycomb's event model shines here
- You want OAuth 2.1 authentication with zero-install hosted setup
- BubbleUp anomaly analysis, heatmaps, and histograms are valuable to your debugging workflow
- You want Agent Skills to automate OTel migration, onboarding, and SLO/trigger creation
- You're on any tier including Free — the hosted MCP works across all plans at no extra cost

**Skip it if:**
- You need the broadest tool coverage — Datadog (50+) and Grafana (40+) still offer more documented tools
- You need self-hosted, open-source, and auditable — Grafana is the choice
- You need traditional APM dashboarding with golden metrics — New Relic is more natural
- You need to add queries to existing boards programmatically — still not supported
- You need Automated Investigations today — it's still in early access

{{< verdict rating="4" summary="Now GA with Agent Skills and Automated Investigations — the deepest observability MCP for high-cardinality debugging" >}}
Honeycomb's MCP integration has matured significantly since our initial review. The hosted server reached GA in September 2025 with BubbleUp, heatmaps, histograms, Service Map, and board creation. March 2026 brought Agent Skills (OTel migration, onboarding, SLO/trigger creation) and Automated Investigations (autonomous SRE playbooks, early access). The hosted server works with Claude Code, Cursor, AWS DevOps Agent, VS Code, and GPT-5. CSV response optimization delivers ~40% token savings. Internal adoption spans 50+ Honeycomb teams, extending observability access to non-engineering roles. The 4/5 rating holds: what's genuinely strong (OAuth-first auth, BubbleUp with heatmap selection, Agent Skills, high-cardinality debugging, free tier access, multi-region, non-Anthropic model support, Automated Investigations in preview) is balanced against real friction (messy deprecation transition with still-unclear hosted tool documentation, 15 unresolved issues on the abandoned self-hosted repo, tight rate limits, 24-hour session timeouts, no board editing, fewer documented tools than competitors, Automated Investigations and Slackbot still in early access). For teams doing distributed system debugging on Honeycomb, this is increasingly the obvious choice. For teams who want the widest tool coverage or open-source flexibility, Datadog and Grafana respectively serve better.
