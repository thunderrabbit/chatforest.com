card_description: "Geospatial and mapping MCP servers across commercial platforms, earth observation, open-source tools, and GIS libraries. Mapbox now offers two official servers — the main MCP server with 20 tools (geocoding, routing, isochrones, static maps, hosted endpoint) and the DevKit for developer workflows (style management, token creation, GeoJSON tools). The biggest update: earth observation arrives via NASA's official Earthdata MCP, Google Earth Engine servers (Axion Planetary with 30+ tools and 5 pre-trained models), and a 72-star NASA APIs server covering 20+ data sources. QGIS MCP streamlined from 36 to 7 super-tools in v1.0.1 for better LLM accuracy. With official servers from Mapbox, NASA, Baidu, and TomTom plus deep GIS integration via gis-mcp's 100+ tools, geospatial is the strongest MCP vertical."

Geospatial and mapping is one of the richest MCP categories we've reviewed. AI agents that can geocode addresses, calculate routes, process satellite imagery, perform spatial analysis, and generate maps through natural language unlock workflows that previously required specialized GIS training. The category now spans six areas: **commercial mapping platforms** (Mapbox, Google Maps, Baidu Maps, TomTom, HERE Maps), **earth observation & remote sensing** (NASA Earthdata, Google Earth Engine, Axion Planetary), **open-source mapping** (OpenStreetMap, QGIS), **GIS operations libraries** (gis-mcp, GeoServer, LocuSync), **government geospatial data** (Japan MLIT), and **data conversion tools**.

The headline finding: **Mapbox now offers two official MCP servers** — the main server with 20 tools plus hosted endpoint at mcp.mapbox.com, and the new DevKit server for developer workflows (style management, token creation, GeoJSON tools). **The biggest update since our initial review: earth observation arrives** — NASA has an official Earthdata MCP for semantic dataset discovery, Google Earth Engine gets multiple community servers (Axion Planetary leads with 112 stars and 30+ tools), and a 72-star NASA APIs server covers 20+ data sources from APOD to Mars Rover photos. **The gis-mcp library has the deepest GIS integration** with 100+ tools across six Python libraries. **QGIS MCP streamlined from 36 to 7 super-tools** in v1.0.1 for better LLM accuracy. The main gap remains that **Google Maps has no official MCP server** — though strong community options exist.

## Commercial Mapping Platforms

### Mapbox

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [mapbox/mcp-server](https://github.com/mapbox/mcp-server) | 315 | TypeScript | 20 | stdio, hosted |

**mapbox/mcp-server** (315 stars, TypeScript, MIT, 104 commits) is the official MCP server from Mapbox. Twenty tools organized into three categories:

**Offline geospatial utilities** (8 tools) — `distance`, `point_in_polygon`, `bearing`, `midpoint`, `centroid`, `area`, `bounding_box`, `buffer`, `simplify`. Local calculations using Turf.js — no API calls needed. These work without a Mapbox token for purely geometric operations.

**API-powered tools** (10 tools) — `search_and_geocode`, `reverse_geocoding`, `category_search`, `directions`, `matrix`, `isochrone`, `map_matching`, `optimization`, `static_image`. Full access to Mapbox's geocoding (global address resolution), routing (driving/walking/cycling with turn-by-turn), travel time matrices (up to 25×25 origins/destinations), isochrones (reachability polygons), map matching (snap GPS traces to roads), and route optimization (multi-stop TSP solving).

**Resource tools** (2 tools) — `resource_reader` for fetching Mapbox tilesets and datasets, plus a deprecated `category_list` tool.

Standout feature: **hosted endpoint at mcp.mapbox.com/mcp** — connect directly without installing or running anything locally. Just add the URL and your Mapbox access token. This is the simplest setup of any geospatial MCP server. Supports Claude Desktop, VS Code, Cursor, and the Goose framework.

Requires a Mapbox access token (free tier available with generous limits). The combination of zero-install hosted mode, offline geometric tools, and comprehensive API coverage makes this the best starting point for geospatial MCP integration.

**mapbox/mcp-devkit-server** (19 stars, TypeScript) is Mapbox's second official MCP server, focused on **developer workflows** rather than location data queries. Tools include style creation and management (`ListStylesTool`, `ValidateStyleTool`), access token generation, GeoJSON formatting and visualization (generates geojson.io URLs for instant preview), coordinate reprojection, and bounding box calculation. A hosted version is available for zero-install setup. This complements the main MCP server — use the main server when agents need geocoding/routing/POI data, use the DevKit when agents are building or debugging Mapbox applications. Supports Claude Desktop, Claude Code, VS Code, and Cursor.

### Google Maps

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [cablate/mcp-google-map](https://github.com/cablate/mcp-google-map) | 193 | TypeScript | 13 | stdio, HTTP |
| [david-pivonka/google-maps-mcp-server](https://github.com/david-pivonka/google-maps-mcp-server) | 2 | TypeScript | 14 | stdio |

Google has no official Google Maps MCP server. Two community servers fill the gap:

**cablate/mcp-google-map** (193 stars, TypeScript, MIT, 77 commits) is the most popular. Ten atomic tools — `maps_search_nearby`, `maps_search_places`, `maps_place_details`, `maps_geocode`, `maps_reverse_geocode`, `maps_distance_matrix`, `maps_directions`, `maps_elevation`, `maps_timezone`, `maps_weather` — plus three composite tools: `maps_explore_area` (neighborhood analysis combining search + details + geocoding), `maps_plan_route` (multi-stop routing with alternatives), `maps_compare_places` (side-by-side venue comparison). Runs in three modes: stdio, StreamableHTTP server, and standalone CLI execution. The composite tools are genuinely useful — they chain multiple API calls into single operations that make sense for agent workflows.

**david-pivonka/google-maps-mcp-server** (2 stars, TypeScript, MIT, 15 commits) has broader API coverage with 14 tools including `places_autocomplete`, `places_photos`, `roads_nearest`, `ip_geolocate`, and `geolocation_estimate` — APIs not covered by cablate's server. More tools but less adoption and no composite operations.

Both require a Google Cloud API key with the Places API (New) enabled. Google also offers the **Google Maps Platform Code Assist toolkit** — an MCP server focused on documentation and code samples rather than live API access, aimed at developers building Maps apps rather than agents using Maps data.

### Baidu Maps

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [baidu-maps/mcp](https://github.com/baidu-maps/mcp) | 411 | Python/JS | 10 | stdio, SSE |

**baidu-maps/mcp** (411 stars, Python 55.9%/JavaScript 44.1%, MIT, 67 commits) is the official Baidu Maps MCP server — the first map service provider in China to support MCP. Ten tools: `map_geocode`, `map_reverse_geocode`, `map_search_places`, `map_place_details`, `map_directions_matrix`, `map_directions`, `map_weather`, `map_ip_location`, `map_road_traffic`, `map_poi_extract`.

The most notable inclusion is `map_road_traffic` for real-time traffic conditions and `map_poi_extract` for extracting points of interest from text — capabilities not found in most mapping MCP servers. Dual SDK support (Python and JavaScript/TypeScript). Requires a server-side API key from Baidu Maps Open Platform with MCP (SSE) service enabled.

Primary value: comprehensive Chinese mapping data. If your use case involves Chinese addresses, roads, or POIs, this is the only real option — Google Maps coverage in China is limited and Mapbox requires separate China-specific tokens.

### TomTom

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [tomtom-international/tomtom-mcp](https://github.com/tomtom-international/tomtom-mcp) | 42 | TypeScript | 18 | stdio |

**tomtom-international/tomtom-mcp** (42 stars, TypeScript, Apache 2.0, 444 commits) is the official TomTom MCP server. Eighteen tools across two backends:

**Standard tools** (11) — `tomtom-geocode`, `tomtom-reverse-geocode`, `tomtom-fuzzy-search`, `tomtom-poi-search`, `tomtom-nearby`, `tomtom-routing`, `tomtom-waypoint-routing`, `tomtom-reachable-range`, `tomtom-traffic`, `tomtom-static-map`, `tomtom-dynamic-map`. Available on both TomTom Maps and Orbis Maps backends.

**Orbis Maps exclusive** (5) — `tomtom-ev-routing`, `tomtom-search-along-route`, `tomtom-area-search`, `tomtom-ev-search`, `tomtom-data-viz`. The EV routing tools are unique — they calculate routes accounting for battery range, charging station locations, and energy consumption, something no other mapping MCP server offers.

The 444-commit count is the highest of any mapping MCP server, indicating serious ongoing development. Requires Node.js 22.x and a TomTom API key (free developer tier available).

### HERE Maps

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [limingchina/heremaps-mcp-server](https://github.com/limingchina/heremaps-mcp-server) | 8 | JavaScript | 6 | stdio |

**limingchina/heremaps-mcp-server** (8 stars, JavaScript, Apache 2.0, 14 commits) is a community server for HERE Maps. Six tools: `maps_geocode`, `maps_reverse_geocode`, `maps_search_places`, `maps_directions`, `maps_get_traffic_incidents`, `maps_display`. Basic but functional coverage of HERE's core APIs. Requires a HERE Maps API key. No official server from HERE exists.

## Earth Observation & Remote Sensing

### NASA Earthdata

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [nasa/earthdata-mcp](https://github.com/nasa/earthdata-mcp) | — | Python | 2+ | stdio |
| [datalayer/earthdata-mcp-server](https://github.com/datalayer/earthdata-mcp-server) | 23 | Python | 2+ | stdio |
| [ProgramComputer/NASA-MCP-server](https://github.com/ProgramComputer/NASA-MCP-server) | 72 | TypeScript | 20+ | stdio |

Three servers bring NASA data to AI agents:

**nasa/earthdata-mcp** (Python, updated March 2026) is NASA's official MCP server for Earthdata. It provides semantic search powered by embeddings for discovering Earth science datasets through NASA's Common Metadata Repository (CMR). Core tools include `search_earth_datasets` and `search_earth_datagranules` for finding datasets and granules within specific collections. The architecture uses AWS Lambda with Terraform infrastructure-as-code, suggesting this is designed for cloud deployment. Each tool is self-contained in its own folder with a manifest and implementation file. This is the first official NASA MCP server — a significant signal for the geospatial community.

**datalayer/earthdata-mcp-server** (23 stars, Python) is a community Earthdata server that adds Jupyter notebook integration — it composes all Jupyter MCP Server tools alongside Earth data discovery, providing a unified interface for finding NASA datasets and analyzing them in notebooks. Useful for researchers who want dataset discovery and interactive analysis in one workflow.

**ProgramComputer/NASA-MCP-server** (72 stars, TypeScript, MIT, npm package `@programcomputer/nasa-mcp-server`) takes a broader approach, covering 20+ NASA APIs through a single interface: APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day), Mars Rover Photos, EPIC (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera), NEO (Near Earth Object Web Service), EONET (Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker), DONKI (Space Weather Database), NASA Image and Video Library, and more. Output is normalized for ML model ingestion. While not focused on Earthdata specifically, it provides the widest coverage of NASA's public APIs.

### Google Earth Engine

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [Dhenenjay/axion-planetary-mcp](https://github.com/Dhenenjay/axion-planetary-mcp) | 112 | TypeScript | 30+ | stdio |
| [cameronking4/google-earth-engine-mcp](https://github.com/cameronking4/google-earth-engine-mcp) | — | TypeScript | — | stdio |

Google Earth Engine (GEE) provides petabytes of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. Two community MCP servers unlock this for AI agents:

**Dhenenjay/axion-planetary-mcp** (112 stars, TypeScript, published Feb 2026) is the most ambitious earth observation MCP server. Over 30 tools and 5 pre-trained models, including what the author calls the "world's first petabyte-scale SAR-to-optical foundation model" using a TerraMind encoder + DARN adaptive decoder architecture (86.66% mIoU accuracy). Capabilities include NDVI/NDWI vegetation analysis, crop classification, wildfire risk assessment, deforestation tracking, and interactive map generation. Supports Sentinel-2, Landsat, and MODIS satellite datasets. An earlier version (Dhenenjay/Axion-MCP, 4 stars) consolidated to 6 "super tools" for stability — the planetary version expands to the full 30+ tool set. Requires a Google Earth Engine service account with API access.

**cameronking4/google-earth-engine-mcp** (TypeScript) enables natural language queries against GEE — search datasets, calculate vegetation indices, filter collections by location and date, run tasks, export imagery to cloud storage, and visualize results in chat. A simpler alternative to Axion for straightforward GEE workflows. Requires a GEE service account JSON key.

Neither server is official from Google. Google Earth Engine itself has no MCP server, making this a significant community-filled gap — GEE is arguably the most important geospatial data platform for environmental science.

## Open-Source Mapping

### QGIS

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [jjsantos01/qgis_mcp](https://github.com/jjsantos01/qgis_mcp) | 839 | Python | 7 | stdio |

**jjsantos01/qgis_mcp** (839 stars, Python) connects QGIS Desktop to AI assistants through MCP. A major **Tool Overhaul in v1.0.1** streamlined the server from 36 tools down to 7 consolidated "super tools" — this reduces context window usage and improves LLM accuracy in selecting the right tool. The remaining tools pack more functionality into each call.

The standout remains `execute_processing` — it exposes QGIS's entire processing algorithm library (hundreds of geoprocessing tools) through a single MCP tool. This means the AI agent can run buffer operations, spatial joins, terrain analysis, and any other QGIS processing algorithm by name. Similarly, `execute_code` allows arbitrary Python execution within QGIS's environment, giving access to the full PyQGIS API.

This is a **desktop integration** — it requires a running QGIS 3.x instance with the MCP plugin installed. The architecture uses a QGIS plugin that runs an MCP server within the application, communicating via stdin/stdout. Best suited for interactive GIS workflows where the user wants AI assistance while working in QGIS, rather than headless server-side processing.

The 839-star count makes it the most popular geospatial MCP server by a wide margin — GIS professionals clearly want AI integration in their existing tools.

### OpenStreetMap

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [jagan-shanmugam/open-streetmap-mcp](https://github.com/jagan-shanmugam/open-streetmap-mcp) | 172 | Python | 12 | stdio |
| [wiseman/osm-mcp](https://github.com/wiseman/osm-mcp) | 74 | Python | 7 | stdio |
| [NERVsystems/osmmcp](https://github.com/NERVsystems/osmmcp) | 15 | Go | 25 | stdio |

Three OpenStreetMap MCP servers with different approaches:

**jagan-shanmugam/open-streetmap-mcp** (172 stars, Python, MIT, 9 commits) is the most popular. Twelve tools focused on practical location queries: `geocode_address`, `reverse_geocode`, `find_nearby_places`, `get_route_directions`, `search_category`, `suggest_meeting_point`, `explore_area`, `find_schools_nearby`, `analyze_commute`, `find_ev_charging_stations`, `analyze_neighborhood`, `find_parking_facilities`. The specialized tools (schools, EV charging, parking, commute analysis) make this feel more like a location assistant than a raw geocoding API. Uses Nominatim and OSRM — no API key required, though rate limits apply.

**wiseman/osm-mcp** (74 stars, Python/HTML, 21 commits) takes a different approach — it combines map visualization with direct database queries. Seven tools: `get_map_view`, `set_map_view`, `set_map_title`, `add_map_marker`, `add_map_line`, `add_map_polygon`, `query_osm_postgres`. Includes a web-based Leaflet map viewer with Server-Sent Events for real-time updates. Requires a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database loaded with OpenStreetMap data — heavier setup but allows complex spatial SQL queries against the full OSM dataset.

**NERVsystems/osmmcp** (15 stars, Go, MIT, 173 commits) has the most tools (25) and most active development. Adds emission enrichment (`enrich_emissions`), polyline encoding/decoding, bbox calculations, tag filtering, and distance sorting on top of the standard geocoding/routing/POI capabilities. Written in Go for performance. The 173-commit count suggests ongoing maintenance.

All three are free — OpenStreetMap data requires no API key. The tradeoff is rate limits on Nominatim/OSRM public instances vs. running your own.

## GIS Operations Libraries

### gis-mcp

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [mahdin75/gis-mcp](https://github.com/mahdin75/gis-mcp) | 120 | Python | 100+ | stdio |

**mahdin75/gis-mcp** (120 stars, Python, 249 commits, v0.14.0 beta) is the most comprehensive GIS MCP server. Over 100 tools bridging six Python GIS libraries to LLMs:

**Shapely** (29 tools) — buffer, intersection, union, difference, symmetric difference, convex hull, simplify, and other geometric operations. The core computational geometry toolkit.

**PyProj** (13 tools) — coordinate transformations between any CRS. Reproject geometries, transform coordinate arrays, compute geodesic distances and areas on the ellipsoid.

**GeoPandas** (13 tools) — read/write geospatial files (Shapefile, GeoJSON, GeoPackage), spatial joins, overlays, dissolves, and attribute operations on geodataframes.

**Rasterio** (20 tools) — raster data I/O, clipping, reprojection, NDVI computation, hillshade generation. Bridges the vector/raster divide.

**PySAL** (18 tools) — spatial statistics, spatial weights, spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I, LISA), and regionalization algorithms.

**Visualization** (2 tools) — `create_static_map` and `create_interactive_web_map` for rendering results.

**Data access** (6 tools) — administrative boundaries, climate data, ecology data, movement data, land cover, and satellite imagery retrieval.

This is effectively a complete GIS workstation exposed via MCP. The breadth is unmatched — no other server covers geometry operations, coordinate transforms, raster processing, spatial statistics, and data visualization in one package. Requires Python 3.10+. Published on PyPI as `gis-mcp`.

### GeoServer MCP

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [mahdin75/geoserver-mcp](https://github.com/mahdin75/geoserver-mcp) | 63 | Python | 40+ | stdio |

**mahdin75/geoserver-mcp** (63 stars, Python, 42 commits) connects LLMs to the GeoServer REST API. Over 40 tools across workspace management (create/list workspaces), datastore management (Shapefile, GeoPackage, PostGIS datastores), layer management (create, configure, list, remove layers), layer group management (7 tools), user and access control (7 tools), feature type and attribute management (6 tools), style management, and system operations.

By the same author as gis-mcp — together they cover both GIS analysis (gis-mcp) and geospatial data serving (geoserver-mcp). Requires a running GeoServer instance with REST API enabled. Python 3.10+.

### LocuSync (GIS-MCP-Server)

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [matbel91765/gis-mcp-server](https://github.com/matbel91765/gis-mcp-server) | 1 | Python | 14 | stdio |

**matbel91765/gis-mcp-server** (1 star, Python, MIT, 32 commits) provides geocoding, routing, elevation, and spatial analysis using free public APIs (Nominatim, OSRM, Open-Elevation). Fourteen tools: `geocode`, `reverse_geocode`, `batch_geocode`, `get_elevation`, `get_elevation_profile`, `distance`, `buffer`, `spatial_query`, `transform_crs`, `route`, `isochrone`, `read_file`, `write_file`. File I/O supports Shapefile, GeoJSON, and GeoPackage formats.

A good lightweight alternative if you need basic geospatial operations without the heavy dependency chain of gis-mcp. No API keys required.

## Government Geospatial Data

### Japan MLIT

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [MLIT-DATA-PLATFORM/mlit-dpf-mcp](https://github.com/MLIT-DATA-PLATFORM/mlit-dpf-mcp) | 130 | Python | 18 | stdio |
| [chirikuuka/mlit-geospatial-mcp](https://github.com/chirikuuka/mlit-geospatial-mcp) | 70 | Python | 1 | stdio |

Two servers for Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) data:

**MLIT-DATA-PLATFORM/mlit-dpf-mcp** (130 stars, Python, MIT, 4 commits) is the official MLIT Data Platform MCP server. Eighteen tools for searching, browsing, and downloading Japan's national geospatial datasets through GraphQL APIs: `search`, `search_by_location_rectangle`, `search_by_location_point_distance`, `search_by_attribute`, `get_data`, `get_data_summary`, `get_data_catalog`, `get_file_download_urls`, `get_prefecture_data`, `get_municipality_data`, `get_mesh`, and more. Covers infrastructure, transportation, land use, and environmental datasets.

**chirikuuka/mlit-geospatial-mcp** (70 stars, Python, MIT, 14 commits) focuses on the Real Estate Information Library API — a single `get_multi_api` tool that accesses 25 of 35 available data types covering property prices, disaster risk zones, schools, medical facilities, population projections, and urban planning designations. Requires an API key from the Real Estate Information Library.

These are niche but notable — Japan is ahead of most countries in providing official MCP access to government geospatial data.

## Data Conversion

### GIS Data Conversion MCP

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [ronantakizawa/gis-dataconversion-mcp](https://github.com/ronantakizawa/gis-dataconversion-mcp) | 15 | JavaScript | 9 | stdio |

**ronantakizawa/gis-dataconversion-mcp** (15 stars, JavaScript, MIT, 19 commits) converts between geospatial formats. Nine tools: `wkt_to_geojson`, `geojson_to_wkt`, `csv_to_geojson`, `geojson_to_csv`, `geojson_to_topojson`, `topojson_to_geojson`, `kml_to_geojson`, `geojson_to_kml`, `coordinates_to_location`. Over 1,000 npm downloads. Simple and focused — when you just need to convert between WKT, GeoJSON, CSV, TopoJSON, and KML formats.

## Desktop GIS Integration

### ArcGIS Pro

| Server | Stars | Language | Tools | Transport |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| [nicogis/MCP-Server-ArcGIS-Pro-AddIn](https://github.com/nicogis/MCP-Server-ArcGIS-Pro-AddIn) | 22 | C# | 4 | stdio (Named Pipes) |

**nicogis/MCP-Server-ArcGIS-Pro-AddIn** (22 stars, C#, 10 commits) integrates MCP with ArcGIS Pro Desktop. Four tools: `pro.getActiveMapName`, `pro.listLayers`, `pro.countFeatures`, `pro.zoomToLayer`. The architecture is clever — a .NET Add-In runs inside ArcGIS Pro and communicates with a separate .NET 8 MCP server via Named Pipes. Currently read-only with limited tools, but demonstrates the pattern for AI-assisted desktop GIS. Requires Visual Studio 2022, ArcGIS Pro SDK, and ArcGIS Pro installation.

## Also notable

- **Google Maps Platform Code Assist** — an official Google MCP server focused on documentation and code samples for developers building Maps applications, not for live API access
- **Cesium AI Integrations** — a repository (March 2026) exploring MCP server integration with Cesium's 3D geospatial platform; still early
- **ThinkGeo MCP Server** — indexes 12,700+ ThinkGeo documentation pages for developer assistance; no API key required
- **Baidu Maps community** (hithereiamaliff/mcp-baidumaps) — an independent Baidu Maps implementation, under improvement
- **FrankXia/arcgis-mcp-servers** — MCP servers for ArcGIS Online services, complementing the desktop ArcGIS Pro Add-In
- **neverinfamous/postgres-mcp** — PostgreSQL MCP server with full PostGIS extension support for spatial SQL queries; useful if your geospatial data lives in PostGIS
- **Datalayer Jupyter Earth MCP** (datalayer/jupyter-earth-mcp-server) — combines Jupyter notebook tools with earth observation data access

## The bottom line

Geospatial is the strongest MCP category we've reviewed. Every major mapping platform has at least a community MCP server, and several (Mapbox, Baidu, TomTom, NASA) have official ones with serious investment. Mapbox now ships two official servers (main + DevKit). The arrival of earth observation — NASA's official Earthdata MCP plus Google Earth Engine community servers — fills the biggest gap from our initial review. The gis-mcp library with 100+ tools across six Python libraries remains the most comprehensive GIS toolkit available via MCP. QGIS MCP's 839 stars and v1.0.1 tool consolidation show a maturing ecosystem.

**Best for general geocoding/routing:** Mapbox MCP (official, hosted, 20 tools, free tier)
**Best for Mapbox development:** Mapbox DevKit MCP (official, styles/tokens/GeoJSON)
**Best for satellite imagery:** Axion Planetary MCP (112 stars, 30+ tools, Google Earth Engine, pre-trained models)
**Best for NASA data:** nasa/earthdata-mcp (official) or ProgramComputer/NASA-MCP-server (72 stars, 20+ APIs)
**Best for Google Maps data:** cablate/mcp-google-map (193 stars, 13 tools with composites)
**Best for GIS analysis:** gis-mcp (100+ tools, Shapely/PyProj/GeoPandas/Rasterio/PySAL)
**Best for desktop GIS:** QGIS MCP (839 stars, 7 super-tools, execute any processing algorithm)
**Best for Chinese mapping:** Baidu Maps MCP (official, 411 stars)
**Best for EV routing:** TomTom MCP (EV-specific routing and charging station tools)
**Best for free/no-API-key:** OpenStreetMap servers (Nominatim + OSRM, rate-limited)

Rating: **4.5/5** — The richest MCP ecosystem, now expanded from mapping-only to full earth observation. Official servers from Mapbox (×2), NASA, Baidu, and TomTom. Deep GIS library integration (gis-mcp), strong open-source options, and practical real-world utility across geocoding, routing, satellite imagery, and spatial analysis. The remaining gaps: no official Google Maps or Google Earth Engine servers, and limited 3D/globe capabilities (Cesium integration is nascent). Upgraded from 4.0 to 4.5 due to earth observation coverage and Mapbox DevKit expansion.
