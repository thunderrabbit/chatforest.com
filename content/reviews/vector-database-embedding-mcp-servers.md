card_description: "Vector database and embedding MCP servers for AI-powered semantic search, RAG pipelines, and agent memory. **Qdrant leads adoption** — qdrant/mcp-server-qdrant (1,300 stars) is the most popular vector DB MCP server, with just 2 tools (store and find) and three transport protocols (stdio, SSE, Streamable HTTP). Its deliberate minimalism positions it as a semantic memory layer rather than a database management tool. **Chroma offers the most tools** — chroma-core/chroma-mcp (515 stars) exposes 13 tools across collection management and document operations, supporting four deployment modes (ephemeral, persistent, HTTP, Cloud) and six embedding providers. The most versatile vector DB MCP server. **Milvus is strongest for self-hosted** — zilliztech/mcp-server-milvus (220 stars) provides 12 tools covering five search types (text, vector, hybrid, text similarity, filter-based), full collection CRUD, and SSE transport. Backed by the most-starred open-source vector DB (40K+ stars) powering NVIDIA, Salesforce, and eBay. **Pinecone adds search intelligence** — pinecone-io/pinecone-mcp (56 stars) brings 9 tools with unique cascading search across multiple indexes, built-in reranking, and documentation search. Cloud-only with integrated embedding — no external embedding provider needed. **Weaviate goes official** — weaviate/mcp-server-weaviate (161 stars) is the official Go-based MCP server with insert and hybrid search tools. **LanceDB provides serverless simplicity** — lancedb/lancedb-mcp-server (23 stars) offers lightweight document ingestion and retrieval with zero infrastructure. **pgvector extends PostgreSQL** — multiple MCP servers (sdimitrov/mcp-memory at 58 stars, stuzero/pg-mcp-server, yusuf-mcp-pgvector-server) add vector similarity search to existing Postgres deployments, ideal for teams that don't want a separate vector database. **Community RAG servers** fill the gap between vector storage and retrieval-augmented generation with document processing pipelines. **Notable gaps** — no FAISS MCP server (library, not service), no Redis Vector Search MCP server, no Vespa MCP server, limited batch import tooling across all servers, and embedding model configuration varies widely. The category earns 4/5 — every major vector database vendor ships an official MCP server, adoption is strong (Qdrant's 1,300 stars leads all database-category MCP servers), and the range from minimalist memory (Qdrant) through comprehensive management (Chroma/Milvus) to cloud-native search (Pinecone) means there's a server for every use case. What holds it back: tool coverage is still uneven (Qdrant's 2 tools vs Chroma's 13), batch operations are limited, and the RAG pipeline layer is fragmented across small community projects."

Vector database MCP servers let AI agents store embeddings, run semantic searches, manage collections, and build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines — all through the Model Context Protocol. Instead of writing Python scripts to initialize clients, create indexes, and query vectors, your agent handles these operations conversationally. Part of our **[Databases MCP category](/categories/databases/)**.

This is the category that makes AI memory and knowledge retrieval work. Vector databases are the backbone of RAG, agent memory, semantic search, and recommendation systems. Every major vector database vendor now ships an official MCP server — a sign of how central this integration has become.

This review covers MCP servers for **dedicated vector databases** (Qdrant, Chroma, Milvus, Pinecone, Weaviate, LanceDB), **vector-enabled traditional databases** (pgvector for PostgreSQL), and **RAG-focused servers** that combine vector storage with document processing. For search engines with vector capabilities (Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, Meilisearch), see our [Search Engine MCP Servers review](/reviews/search-engine-mcp-servers/). For individual deep-dives, see our reviews of [Qdrant](/reviews/qdrant-mcp-server/), [Chroma](/reviews/chroma-mcp-server/), [Pinecone](/reviews/pinecone-mcp-server/), and [Milvus](/reviews/milvus-mcp-server/).

The headline findings: **Qdrant leads adoption** (1,300 stars) with a minimalist 2-tool design. **Chroma offers the most tools** (13) across four deployment modes. **Milvus is the strongest self-hosted option** (12 tools, five search types). **Pinecone uniquely adds cascading search and reranking.** **Every major vendor ships an official server** — a maturity signal few MCP categories can match.

## The Dedicated Vector Database Servers

### Qdrant — Most Adopted, Most Minimal

| Server | Stars | Forks | Language | Official |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| [mcp-server-qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/mcp-server-qdrant) | 1,300 | 239 | Python | Yes |

The **most popular vector database MCP server by a wide margin.** Qdrant's server exposes exactly 2 tools: `qdrant-store` (save information with metadata) and `qdrant-find` (retrieve by semantic similarity). That's it — no collection management, no deletes, no batch operations.

This is a deliberate design choice. The server positions itself as a **semantic memory layer** — giving AI agents persistent memory across conversations rather than full database management. It's the only vector DB MCP server supporting all three transport protocols: stdio, SSE, and Streamable HTTP.

**Best for:** Agent memory, conversation persistence, teams that want the simplest possible setup. Qdrant itself has 23,000+ stars and is one of the most performant vector search engines available (Rust-based).

**Limitation:** If you need to manage collections, tune indexes, delete records, or do anything beyond store-and-find, you'll need to use the Qdrant API directly.

*Full review: [Qdrant MCP Server](/reviews/qdrant-mcp-server/) — Rating: 3/5*

### Chroma — Most Comprehensive Tool Set

| Server | Stars | Forks | Language | Official |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| [chroma-mcp](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma-mcp) | 515 | — | Python | Yes |

**13 tools** make this the most feature-complete vector database MCP server. Eight tools handle collection management (create, list, peek, info, count, modify, delete, fork) and five handle document operations (add, query, get, update, delete).

What sets Chroma apart is **four deployment modes** — ephemeral (in-memory for testing), persistent (local storage), self-hosted HTTP server, and Chroma Cloud — all configurable through the same MCP server. Plus support for **six embedding providers** (OpenAI, Cohere, Google, HuggingFace, Roboflow, Ollama).

**Best for:** Teams that want full database management through their AI agent, developers prototyping RAG applications, workflows that need to create/modify/delete collections conversationally.

**Limitation:** The breadth of tools can overwhelm agents — LLMs sometimes pick the wrong tool when 13 are available. Chroma itself is best for small-to-medium scale (not billions of vectors).

*Full review: [Chroma MCP Server](/reviews/chroma-mcp-server/) — Rating: 3.5/5*

### Milvus — Strongest Self-Hosted Option

| Server | Stars | Forks | Language | Official |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| [mcp-server-milvus](https://github.com/zilliztech/mcp-server-milvus) | 220 | 63 | Python | Yes |

**12 tools** with the unique strength of **five search types**: text search, vector search, hybrid search (text + vector combined), text similarity search, and filter-based queries. Full collection CRUD and data operations round out the feature set. Supports both stdio and SSE transport.

Milvus is the **most-starred open-source vector database** (40,000+ GitHub stars) and powers production AI at NVIDIA, Salesforce, eBay, Airbnb, and DoorDash. The MCP server reflects this enterprise orientation with comprehensive search options and schema customization.

**Best for:** Self-hosted production deployments, teams that need hybrid search, enterprise environments already running Milvus or Zilliz Cloud.

**Limitation:** More complex setup than Chroma or Qdrant. Text similarity search requires Milvus 2.6.0+. Documentation assumes familiarity with Milvus concepts (partitions, schemas, index types).

*Full review: [Milvus MCP Server](/reviews/milvus-mcp-server/) — Rating: 3.5/5*

### Pinecone — Search Intelligence Built In

| Server | Stars | Forks | Language | Official |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| [pinecone-mcp](https://github.com/pinecone-io/pinecone-mcp) | 56 | — | TypeScript | Yes |

**9 tools** with two features no other vector DB MCP server offers: **cascading search** across multiple indexes simultaneously with deduplication, and **built-in reranking** of combined results. Also includes a documentation search tool for answering "how do I..." questions about Pinecone directly.

Pinecone's integrated embedding means you send text in and get search results back — no external embedding provider configuration needed. This is the most search-quality-focused server in the category.

**Best for:** Cloud-native teams using Pinecone, workflows that search across multiple knowledge bases, applications where search quality (reranking) matters more than database management.

**Limitation:** Cloud-only — requires a Pinecone account and API key. No self-hosted option. Lower adoption than Qdrant or Chroma (56 stars). Actually one of three Pinecone MCP servers (Developer, Assistant, and a potential merge in the future).

*Full review: [Pinecone MCP Server](/reviews/pinecone-mcp-server/) — Rating: 3/5*

### Weaviate — Official Go Server

| Server | Stars | Forks | Language | Official |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| [mcp-server-weaviate](https://github.com/weaviate/mcp-server-weaviate) | 161 | 43 | Go | Yes |

Weaviate's official MCP server provides **insert and hybrid search** capabilities. Written in Go (98.9% of the codebase), it's the only major vector DB MCP server not written in Python or TypeScript.

Weaviate itself is notable for its **hybrid search** architecture (combining vector and keyword search natively), modular vectorizer architecture, and multi-tenancy support. The MCP server is relatively new and minimal compared to Chroma or Milvus.

**Best for:** Teams already using Weaviate, Go-centric environments, workflows that need hybrid search.

**Limitation:** Only two tools (insert and query). Minimal documentation and setup instructions. Young project with limited community adoption beyond the star count.

A community alternative exists: [sajal2692/mcp-weaviate](https://github.com/sajal2692/mcp-weaviate) — a FastMCP-based Python server with semantic, keyword, and hybrid search, deployable via uvx.

### LanceDB — Serverless Simplicity

| Server | Stars | Forks | Language | Official |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| [lancedb-mcp-server](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb-mcp-server) | 23 | 6 | Python | Yes |

LanceDB's serverless architecture means **no infrastructure to manage** — data lives on disk or cloud storage (S3, GCS, Azure) with no server process required. The MCP server provides three tools: ingest docs, retrieve docs, and get table details.

This is a **reference implementation** rather than a production-ready server, but it demonstrates LanceDB's appeal: zero-config vector storage that works anywhere you have a filesystem. LanceDB uses the Lance columnar format for fast vector operations.

**Best for:** Prototyping, local development, serverless deployments, teams that want vector search without running a database server.

**Limitation:** Very early stage (23 stars, 3 commits). Minimal tool coverage. Positioned as educational/reference rather than production-ready.

Community alternatives include [RyanLisse/lancedb_mcp](https://github.com/RyanLisse/lancedb_mcp) (vector operations + metadata management) and [adiom-data/lance-mcp](https://github.com/adiom-data/lance-mcp) (agentic RAG with hybrid search on local documents).

## Vector-Enabled Traditional Databases

### pgvector — Vector Search in PostgreSQL

| Server | Stars | Language | Approach |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| [sdimitrov/mcp-memory](https://github.com/sdimitrov/mcp-memory) | 58 | JavaScript | Long-term AI memory with pgvector |
| [stuzero/pg-mcp-server](https://github.com/stuzero/pg-mcp-server) | — | — | Full Postgres MCP with pgvector context |
| yusuf-mcp-pgvector-server | — | — | Semantic search with Azure OpenAI/HuggingFace |

For teams that **already run PostgreSQL**, adding vector search through pgvector avoids introducing a new database. The pgvector extension (13,000+ stars) adds vector data types and operations to Postgres with IVF and HNSW indexing.

**sdimitrov/mcp-memory** is the most developed option — implementing "mem0 principles" for AI assistant long-term memory with automatic BERT embedding generation, tag-based retrieval, confidence scoring, and Server-Sent Events for real-time updates. It runs on Node.js with Prisma ORM.

**Best for:** Teams already running PostgreSQL who want to add vector search without a new database, applications where vector data lives alongside relational data, organizations with existing Postgres expertise.

**Limitation:** pgvector performs well up to ~10M vectors but purpose-built vector databases (Qdrant, Milvus) significantly outperform it at scale. The MCP servers are community-maintained with moderate adoption.

### MongoDB Atlas Vector Search

| Server | Stars | Language | Official |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| [mongodb-mcp-server](https://github.com/mongodb-js/mongodb-mcp-server) | — | TypeScript | Yes |

MongoDB's official MCP server supports Atlas Vector Search alongside standard document operations. Teams already on MongoDB Atlas can add vector search to their existing deployment through configured embedding models — no separate vector database needed.

**Best for:** MongoDB Atlas users who want vector search alongside document operations without adding infrastructure.

### Supabase (pgvector under the hood)

| Server | Stars | Language | Official |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| [supabase-mcp](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-mcp) | — | — | Community |

Supabase uses pgvector for its vector search capabilities. The Supabase MCP server provides database management including vector operations, with the added benefit of Supabase's auth, storage, and realtime features.

**Best for:** Supabase users who want vector search integrated with their existing backend-as-a-service stack.

## RAG-Focused Servers

Several community MCP servers specifically target **retrieval-augmented generation** workflows — combining document processing, embedding, vector storage, and retrieval in one package:

| Server | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| [kwanLeeFrmVi/mcp-rag-server](https://github.com/kwanLeeFrmVi/mcp-rag-server) | Document indexing and retrieval for LLMs |
| [micro-agent/mcp-rag-server](https://github.com/micro-agent/mcp-rag-server) | Lightweight RAG pipeline |
| [myonathanlinkedin/mcp-rag-scanner](https://github.com/myonathanlinkedin/mcp-rag-scanner) | Web/file scraping → embedding → vector storage |
| IcedVodka/rag_mcp (Glama) | Modular RAG with pluggable components |

These servers fill an important gap: the dedicated vector DB MCP servers handle storage and retrieval, but **none of them handle the full RAG pipeline** — ingesting documents, chunking, embedding, storing, and retrieving. The RAG servers attempt to be end-to-end.

**The trade-off:** These are small community projects with limited adoption. For production RAG, most teams will combine a vector DB MCP server with their own document processing pipeline rather than relying on an all-in-one community server.

## How They Compare

| Server | Stars | Tools | Search Types | Transport | Deployment | Official |
|--------|-------|-------|-------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Qdrant** | 1,300 | 2 | Semantic | stdio, SSE, HTTP | Self-hosted, Cloud | Yes |
| **Chroma** | 515 | 13 | Semantic, regex | stdio | Ephemeral, local, HTTP, Cloud | Yes |
| **Milvus** | 220 | 12 | Text, vector, hybrid, similarity, filter | stdio, SSE | Self-hosted, Zilliz Cloud | Yes |
| **Weaviate** | 161 | 2 | Hybrid | stdio | Self-hosted, Cloud | Yes |
| **Pinecone** | 56 | 9 | Semantic, cascading, reranked | stdio | Cloud only | Yes |
| **LanceDB** | 23 | 3 | Semantic | stdio | Serverless (disk/cloud) | Yes |
| **pgvector** (mcp-memory) | 58 | — | Semantic + tags | SSE | Requires PostgreSQL | Community |

## What Works Well

**Every major vendor ships an official server.** Qdrant, Chroma, Milvus, Pinecone, Weaviate, and LanceDB all have first-party MCP servers. This is a level of vendor commitment that few MCP categories can match — contrast this with search engines (Elasticsearch's official server is deprecated) or CRM (no official Salesforce MCP server).

**The design philosophy spectrum is useful.** Qdrant's 2-tool minimalism is perfect for agent memory. Chroma's 13-tool comprehensiveness is perfect for database management. Milvus's five search types serve production needs. Pinecone's reranking serves search quality. Teams can pick the philosophy that matches their use case.

**Adoption is real.** Qdrant's 1,300 stars makes it one of the most popular MCP servers in any category. The vector DB MCP ecosystem has meaningful community usage, not just proof-of-concept repos.

**Transport protocol support is strong.** Qdrant supports all three protocols (stdio, SSE, Streamable HTTP). Milvus supports stdio and SSE. This matters for enterprise deployments where HTTP transport enables shared MCP server instances.

## What Doesn't Work Well

**Tool coverage is wildly uneven.** Qdrant's 2 tools vs Chroma's 13 isn't just a design choice — it means Qdrant users can't manage collections, delete records, or configure embeddings through MCP at all. There's no middle ground server that offers, say, 6-8 essential tools.

**Batch operations are limited everywhere.** None of these servers handle bulk import workflows well. Ingesting thousands of documents through MCP tool calls is impractical — you'll still need scripts or pipelines for initial data loading.

**Embedding configuration is fragmented.** Chroma lets you pick from six providers. Pinecone handles embeddings internally. Qdrant requires FastEmbed or external configuration. Milvus uses embedded functions. There's no standard approach, and misconfigured embeddings silently produce bad search results.

**No unified RAG pipeline.** The vector DB servers handle storage and retrieval. The RAG servers handle document processing. But nothing ties them together cleanly. Building a production RAG pipeline still requires significant glue code outside of MCP.

**Missing vendors.** No FAISS MCP server (FAISS is a library, not a service, so this is architectural), no Redis Vector Search MCP server (Redis has vector search capabilities but no dedicated MCP server), no Vespa MCP server, no Turbopuffer official MCP server (only a small community one).

## What's Missing

- **FAISS** — Meta's vector search library is widely used but architecturally doesn't fit the MCP server model (it's a library, not a service)
- **Redis Vector Search** — Redis has vector search capabilities but no dedicated MCP server
- **Vespa** — Yahoo's big data search engine with vector capabilities has no MCP server
- **Marqo** — tensor search engine with no MCP server
- **Unified embedding management** — no cross-database embedding model configuration
- **Vector index tuning** — limited ability to configure HNSW parameters, quantization, or index optimization through MCP
- **Migration tools** — no MCP server for moving vectors between databases
- **Monitoring** — no MCP server for monitoring vector database performance, index health, or query latency

## The Bottom Line

**Rating: 4/5** — The vector database MCP category is one of the strongest in the entire MCP ecosystem. Every major vendor ships an official server — Qdrant, Chroma, Milvus, Pinecone, Weaviate, and LanceDB all have first-party support. Adoption is real (Qdrant's 1,300 stars leads all database-category MCP servers). The design philosophy spectrum — from Qdrant's 2-tool minimalism to Chroma's 13-tool comprehensiveness — means there's genuinely a server for every use case.

What keeps it from a higher rating: tool coverage is wildly uneven across vendors, batch operations are limited everywhere, embedding configuration is fragmented, and the RAG pipeline layer is still small community projects rather than production-ready solutions. But for the core use case — giving AI agents semantic memory and vector search capabilities — this category delivers.

**Pick Qdrant** if you want the simplest setup and just need store/find. **Pick Chroma** if you want full database management through your agent. **Pick Milvus** if you need hybrid search and enterprise scale. **Pick Pinecone** if search quality (reranking) matters most. **Pick pgvector** if you're already on PostgreSQL and don't want another database.
