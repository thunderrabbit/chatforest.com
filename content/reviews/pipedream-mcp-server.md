**At a glance:** 11,200 stars, 5,600 forks, Pipedream Source Available License, JavaScript/TypeScript, Streamable HTTP + SSE + stdio transport, 10,000+ MCP tools, 2,800+ API integrations, hosted remote server.

Pipedream's MCP pitch is simple: **connect your AI agent to any of 2,800+ APIs without writing integration code or managing OAuth tokens**. Instead of installing a separate MCP server for Slack, another for GitHub, another for Google Sheets — Pipedream provides a single platform where each app gets its own MCP endpoint with tools auto-generated from Pipedream's registry of pre-built actions.

The [Pipedream repository](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream) has 11,200 GitHub stars, 236 contributors, and 5,600 forks. The company raised $22M in Series A funding (May 2022) and was [acquired by Workday](https://newsroom.workday.com/2025-11-19-Workday-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Pipedream) in late 2025 — adding enterprise backing to what started as a developer-focused workflow platform. Over 800,000 developers have registered accounts, with 5,000+ paying customers.

## What It Does

Pipedream doesn't expose a fixed list of MCP tools. Instead, it uses a **per-app architecture** where each of its 2,800+ supported apps gets a dedicated MCP server endpoint. Tools are automatically generated from Pipedream's registry of pre-built actions — totaling over 10,000 tools.

### How the Per-App Architecture Works

Each app has its own endpoint identified by an "app slug":

```
https://remote.mcp.pipedream.net/v1/{external_user_id}/slack
https://remote.mcp.pipedream.net/v1/{external_user_id}/github
https://remote.mcp.pipedream.net/v1/{external_user_id}/google_sheets
```

When an AI agent connects to the Slack endpoint, it gets Slack-specific tools: `send_message`, `manage_channels`, `create_reminders`, and more. Connect to the GitHub endpoint and you get `create_issue`, `manage_pull_requests`, `search_repositories`. Each endpoint exposes only the tools relevant to that app — keeping tool lists focused and avoiding the "200 tools in one server" problem.

### Dynamic App Discovery

With the `appDiscovery=true` parameter, Pipedream can dynamically list available apps and update tools in real-time as new apps are connected. This lets agents discover what integrations are available without hardcoding app slugs.

### Example Tools by App

| App | Example Tools |
|-----|--------------|
| **Slack** | Send messages, manage channels, create reminders |
| **GitHub** | Create issues, manage pull requests, search repositories |
| **Google Sheets** | Read/write data, format cells, create charts |
| **Google Calendar** | Query free/busy calendars, schedule meetings |
| **Gmail** | Send emails, read inbox, manage labels |
| **Salesforce** | Create/update records, run SOQL queries |
| **Shopify** | Manage products, orders, customers |
| **HubSpot** | Manage contacts, deals, tickets |

This list covers a tiny fraction. The full catalog includes tools for Stripe, Notion, Airtable, Jira, Linear, Discord, Twilio, SendGrid, AWS services, databases, and thousands more.

### Managed OAuth

This is arguably Pipedream's strongest differentiator for MCP. Every API integration comes with managed OAuth — credentials are encrypted at rest, never exposed to the LLM or MCP client, and automatically refreshed. Users authenticate once through Pipedream's OAuth flow, and the platform handles token management for all 2,800+ apps.

For developers building multi-user applications, Pipedream Connect assigns credentials per `external_user_id`, so each end user gets their own authenticated sessions.

## Architecture

Pipedream operates as a **layered proxy** between your AI agent and third-party APIs:

```
AI Agent → Pipedream MCP Server → Pipedream Connect API (manages auth) → Third-Party APIs
```

Key architectural details:

- **Serverless architecture** with auto-scaling and built-in concurrency controls to prevent rate-limit violations on target APIs
- **Per-user credential isolation** — credentials stored per `external_user_id` in a Pipedream project
- **No data storage** — Pipedream proxies requests to APIs; it doesn't cache or store response data
- Supports both **hosted** (remote.mcp.pipedream.net) and **self-hosted** deployment

### Tool Modes

Pipedream supports three tool modes via the `x-pd-tool-mode` header:

- **tools-only** — exposes just the action tools for the specified app
- **sub-agent** — wraps each app as a sub-agent with its own context
- **full-config** — exposes configuration and setup tools alongside action tools

## Setup

### Hosted Remote Server (Recommended)

The primary deployment method uses Pipedream's hosted Streamable HTTP endpoint:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pipedream": {
      "transport": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://remote.mcp.pipedream.net/v1/{user_id}/{app_slug}",
      "headers": {
        "x-pd-project-id": "proj_xxxxxxx",
        "x-pd-environment": "development"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Self-Hosted via npx

For local development or stdio transport:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pipedream": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@pipedream/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Requires environment variables: `PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID`, `PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET`, `PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID`, and `PIPEDREAM_ENVIRONMENT`.

### Transport Support

| Transport | Endpoint |
|-----------|----------|
| **Streamable HTTP** | `https://remote.mcp.pipedream.net/v1/{user}/{app}` |
| **SSE** | `https://remote.mcp.pipedream.net/{user}/{app}` |
| **Stdio** | Local via `npx @pipedream/mcp` |

### Authentication

Pipedream uses OAuth client credentials. You create an OAuth client in your Pipedream project, then use the SDK or direct endpoint to get a bearer token. Required headers for the remote server include `x-pd-project-id`, `x-pd-environment`, `x-pd-external-user-id`, and `x-pd-app-slug`.

## Pricing

| Plan | Price/mo | Credits/mo | Active Workflows | Connected Accounts |
|------|----------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Free** | $0 | 100 | 3 | 3 |
| **Basic** | $29 | 2,000 | 10 | 5 |
| **Advanced** | $49 | 2,000 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| **Connect** | $99 | 10,000 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| **Business** | Custom | Custom | Unlimited | Unlimited |

**Credit system:** 1 credit = 30 seconds of compute at 256MB memory. Doubling memory doubles cost. Credits don't roll over.

**Connect plan specifics:** Designed for developers building multi-user apps with Pipedream Connect. Includes 100 end users; additional users at $2/user/month.

The hosted MCP experience at mcp.pipedream.com is free for personal use. The free tier's 100 credits and 3 connected accounts will cap quickly for any serious agent workflow.

## How It Compares

| Feature | Pipedream | Composio | n8n | Individual MCP Servers |
|---------|-----------|----------|-----|----------------------|
| **MCP Tools** | 10,000+ | ~900 | Community | Varies (5-50 per server) |
| **API Integrations** | 2,800+ | 500+ | 500+ | 1 per server |
| **License** | Source Available | Open source | Fair-code (AGPLv3) | Varies |
| **Managed OAuth** | Yes (all apps) | Yes | Self-managed | Usually DIY |
| **Self-Hosted** | Yes (reference only) | Yes | Yes | Usually yes |
| **Transport** | HTTP + SSE + stdio | stdio + SSE | Varies | Varies |
| **SOC 2 / HIPAA** | Yes | No | No | Rarely |
| **Enterprise Backing** | Workday (acquired) | Series A | Community + company | Varies |

**vs. Composio:** Composio was built agent-first from the ground up; Pipedream added MCP to an existing workflow automation platform. Composio has ~900 tools across 500+ apps. Pipedream has 10K+ tools across 2,800+ apps — but many are auto-generated wrappers rather than purpose-built agent tools. Composio offers more granular permission controls.

**vs. n8n:** n8n is a self-hosted workflow automation platform with community-contributed MCP support. It has fewer integrations (500+) and requires more manual configuration. Pipedream's hosted approach is significantly easier to set up, but n8n's fair-code license gives more deployment flexibility.

**vs. Individual MCP Servers:** A dedicated Slack MCP server will have deeper Slack-specific functionality than Pipedream's auto-generated Slack tools. But managing 20 separate MCP servers with 20 separate OAuth configurations is a maintenance burden. Pipedream consolidates auth and provides a consistent interface across all apps.

## What to Watch Out For

**The npm package is a "reference implementation."** The self-hosted `@pipedream/mcp` package (v0.0.1, 89 weekly downloads) is explicitly labeled "not actively maintained." Pipedream pushes users toward the hosted remote server. If you need self-hosted MCP, this isn't the right choice.

**Tool quality varies across 2,800 apps.** With 10,000+ auto-generated tools, coverage is inevitably uneven. Some app integrations are deep and well-tested; others are thin wrappers. Google Calendar tools have been reported to exceed MCP's maximum tool name length, causing API failures. Some tools include unsupported parameters that target APIs reject.

**OAuth limitations with certain clients.** MCP clients without browser-based OAuth support (LM Studio, Open WebUI) face 401 errors or "Missing nonce claim" failures. The OAuth flow works best with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and similar browser-capable clients.

**Known bugs in production.** Users have reported Failed Dependency (424) errors with Gmail and other tools, multi-account handling issues (defaults to one connected account per app), and parameter mismatches between generated tools and target APIs.

**Source Available License, not open source.** The Pipedream Source Available License Version 1.0 is not an OSI-approved open-source license. You can read and modify the code, but the license restricts certain commercial uses.

**Workday acquisition introduces uncertainty.** Workday acquired Pipedream in late 2025. This adds enterprise credibility and resources, but also raises questions about future pricing, product direction, and whether the developer-focused free tier will survive corporate priorities. For now, the platform continues operating as before.

**Cost scales with usage.** The free tier (100 credits, 3 accounts) is extremely limited. The Connect plan at $99/month is the realistic minimum for building multi-user agent applications. At scale, costs can accumulate quickly — especially with credit-based compute pricing where memory usage affects billing.

## The Bottom Line

Pipedream is the **widest MCP server available by a large margin** — 10,000+ tools across 2,800+ APIs, all with managed OAuth. The per-app architecture is well-designed, keeping tool lists focused rather than dumping thousands of tools into a single endpoint. For developers building AI agents that need to interact with many different SaaS apps, Pipedream eliminates the biggest pain point: auth management.

But the platform's origins as a workflow automation tool show through. The MCP layer is a proxy over existing actions, not a purpose-built agent interface. Tool quality varies across the massive catalog, the self-hosted option is barely maintained, and the Source Available license limits some use cases. The Workday acquisition adds both enterprise credibility and strategic uncertainty.

Pipedream makes the most sense when you need **breadth over depth** — connecting agents to 10+ different APIs where "good enough" integration quality is acceptable, and where managed OAuth at scale is more valuable than hand-tuned tool interfaces.

**Rating: 3.5/5** — Unmatched integration breadth and managed OAuth across 2,800+ APIs; loses half a point each for variable tool quality across the auto-generated catalog, barely-maintained self-hosted option, and strategic uncertainty from the Workday acquisition.
