---

Every AI workflow that touches the physical world eventually needs OCR. Scanned contracts, handwritten notes, screenshots, receipts, whiteboards — if it's an image with text, you need a way to extract that text for an LLM to work with.

This review covers MCP servers specifically built for **optical character recognition and document intelligence** — extracting text from images and scanned documents where the text isn't already digital. For MCP servers that process digital PDFs, DOCX, and other native document formats, see our [PDF & Document Processing review](/reviews/pdf-document-mcp-servers/). There's overlap (Docling and MarkItDown both have OCR capabilities), but the servers here are purpose-built for recognition tasks.

The headline: **PaddleOCR is the clear leader as the only major OCR vendor with an official MCP server**, backed by Baidu's 72,000-star library. The community has built wrappers around every major OCR engine — Tesseract, EasyOCR, Surya/Marker, Mistral, Gemini — but adoption is low across the board. Multi-model OCR servers are the most interesting emerging pattern, letting you pick the right engine per document type.

## Official Vendor Servers

### PaddleOCR MCP (Baidu/PaddlePaddle)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR) (MCP at `/mcp_server`) | ~72,000 stars (parent repo) |
| License | Apache-2.0 |
| Language | Python |
| Tools | 2 (OCR, PP-StructureV3) |
| Languages | 100+ |
| Install | `pip install paddleocr-mcp` |

The most significant OCR MCP server by a wide margin — not because of the MCP wrapper itself, but because of what's behind it. PaddleOCR is Baidu's flagship open-source OCR system, the most-starred OCR project on GitHub, and one of the few where the parent organization ships the MCP integration directly.

### What Works Well

**Two tools covering different use cases.** The `OCR` tool handles standard text detection and recognition on images and PDFs. `PP-StructureV3` does layout analysis — extracting text blocks, titles, tables, and converting structured documents to Markdown. This separation matters: simple OCR for receipts and screenshots, structured extraction for complex documents.

**100+ language support.** From Chinese (PaddleOCR's origin) to Arabic, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, and most Latin-script languages. This is the broadest language coverage of any OCR MCP server.

**Three working modes.** Local Python library (no API key, runs entirely offline), AIStudio cloud service (Baidu's cloud — useful for GPU-less machines), or self-hosted deployment. The local mode makes this genuinely free and private.

**Active, well-maintained.** The parent PaddleOCR library has 800+ contributors and regular releases. The MCP server inherits a battle-tested OCR pipeline — not a weekend wrapper.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**Resource requirements.** Running PaddleOCR locally requires downloading models (several hundred MB) and benefits significantly from GPU acceleration. On CPU-only machines, inference is slower than cloud alternatives.

**MCP wrapper is young.** The MCP server is a small addition to a massive project. Documentation is sparse compared to the main library, and the tool count is minimal (2 tools vs. PaddleOCR's full API surface).

**Baidu ecosystem assumptions.** The AIStudio cloud mode ties into Baidu's infrastructure, which may not be accessible or desirable outside China. The local mode has no such constraint.

## Cloud API Wrappers

These servers wrap commercial OCR APIs, trading privacy and cost for quality and speed.

### Mistral OCR MCP

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [everaldo/mcp-mistral-ocr](https://github.com/everaldo/mcp-mistral-ocr) | ~37 stars |
| License | Not specified |
| Language | Python |
| Tools | 1 |
| Auth | Mistral API key |

Wraps Mistral's OCR API, which has become one of the highest-quality OCR services available — particularly strong on complex layouts, tables, and mixed-language documents.

### What Works Well

**Mistral's OCR quality is excellent.** The underlying API consistently ranks among the best for complex document OCR, especially for European languages and structured documents. If you need high accuracy without local GPU infrastructure, this is compelling.

**Simple interface.** One tool that accepts local files (images and PDFs) or URLs. Docker support. Straightforward setup.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**API cost.** Every OCR request hits Mistral's API. No local fallback, no offline mode. Costs accumulate on high-volume workflows.

**No license specified.** The GitHub repo has no license file — technically "all rights reserved" by default. Fine for personal use, risky for production.

### Gemini OCR MCP

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [WindoC/gemini-ocr-mcp](https://github.com/WindoC/gemini-ocr-mcp) | ~4 stars |
| Language | Python |
| Tools | 2 (`ocr_image_file`, `ocr_image_base64`) |
| Auth | Google Gemini API key |

Uses Google's Gemini vision models for OCR. Two tools — one for file paths, one for base64-encoded images. Minimal adoption but functional.

**Trade-off:** Gemini's vision models handle OCR reasonably well as a side capability, but they're not purpose-built OCR engines. Quality varies more than dedicated OCR services, especially on small text, unusual fonts, or degraded images. The Gemini free tier makes this cost-effective for low-volume use.

### AWS Document Loader MCP

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [awslabs/mcp](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp) (at `src/document-loader-mcp-server`) | ~4,700 stars (monorepo) |
| License | Apache-2.0 |
| Language | Python |
| Tools | Multiple (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, images) |

Part of AWS's official MCP monorepo. Uses pdfplumber for PDF text extraction, markitdown for Office formats, and direct image loading (PNG, JPG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WEBP). Slide/page extraction to PNG from presentations and PDFs.

**Notable:** This is a document loader, not a dedicated OCR server — but it's worth mentioning because it's official AWS infrastructure and handles the image-to-text pipeline as part of a broader document ingestion workflow. No external API dependency for basic operations.

## Local OCR Engines

These servers run OCR entirely on your machine — no API keys, no cloud calls, full privacy.

### Markdownify MCP

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [zcaceres/markdownify-mcp](https://github.com/zcaceres/markdownify-mcp) | ~2,400 stars |
| License | MIT |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Tools | 10 |
| Formats | PDF, images, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, audio, YouTube, web pages |

The most popular community MCP server that includes OCR capability. Markdownify converts 8+ input types to Markdown, including image-to-markdown (OCR) and PDF-to-markdown.

### What Works Well

**Breadth of tools.** Ten conversion tools covering pdf-to-markdown, image-to-markdown, docx, xlsx, pptx, audio transcription, YouTube transcription, webpage scraping, and Bing search. It's a Swiss army knife — OCR is one blade among many.

**2,400 stars and MIT license.** The most adopted community option by far. Active maintenance and TypeScript implementation makes it easy to extend.

**One server, many capabilities.** Instead of installing separate MCP servers for PDFs, images, audio, and web pages, Markdownify handles all of them. Reduces configuration overhead significantly.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**OCR is not the primary focus.** The image-to-markdown tool works, but it's not optimized for OCR accuracy the way PaddleOCR or Tesseract wrappers are. Complex layouts, small text, and handwriting will struggle.

**Jack of all trades.** Covering 10 conversion types in one server means none gets deep optimization. Dedicated OCR servers outperform on pure recognition tasks.

### Marker MCP Server

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [moatasim-KT/Marker_MCP_Server](https://github.com/moatasim-KT/Marker_MCP_Server) | Low stars |
| License | Marker Contributor Agreement |
| Language | Python |
| Backend | Marker (VikParuchuri) + Surya OCR 0.14.1 |

Wraps [Marker](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker), one of the best open-source PDF-to-Markdown converters, which itself uses [Surya](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/surya) — a state-of-the-art OCR engine that rivals commercial offerings.

### What Works Well

**Surya OCR quality.** Surya is widely regarded as the best open-source OCR engine for structured documents. It handles multi-column layouts, tables, mathematical formulas, and mixed languages significantly better than Tesseract. Marker adds heading detection, caption recognition, and layout-aware Markdown generation on top.

**LLM-powered refinement.** Marker can optionally use an LLM to clean up OCR output — fixing recognition errors, improving formatting, and resolving ambiguities. This is a unique feature in the MCP OCR ecosystem.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**License complexity.** The Marker Contributor Agreement is not a standard open-source license. Check compatibility with your use case.

**Low adoption.** The MCP wrapper has minimal stars, suggesting limited community testing. The underlying Marker and Surya libraries are well-tested, but the MCP integration layer is young.

**Heavy dependencies.** Surya requires PyTorch and OCR model downloads. Not lightweight.

### EasyOCR MCP

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [WindoC/easyocr-mcp](https://github.com/WindoC/easyocr-mcp) | Low stars |
| Language | Python |
| Tools | 3 (base64, file, URL inputs) |
| Languages | 80+ |

Wraps [EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR), the second most popular open-source OCR library after PaddleOCR (24,000+ stars on the parent).

**Three input methods** — base64-encoded images, local file paths, and URLs — cover every common integration pattern. Returns both text-only and detailed results with coordinates and confidence scores. GPU acceleration supported. No API key required.

**80+ languages** configured via `EASYOCR_LANGUAGES` environment variable. Good for multilingual documents, though PaddleOCR's 100+ languages and generally higher accuracy on CJK scripts make it the better choice for Asian languages.

**Low adoption** on the MCP wrapper despite the parent library's popularity. The MCP server is functional but has had minimal community testing.

### Tesseract MCP Server

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [maximdx/tesseract-mcp-server](https://github.com/maximdx/tesseract-mcp-server) | Low stars |
| Language | Python |
| Tools | 1 (`convert_pdf`) |
| Languages | English, Chinese (configurable) |

Wraps [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract), the oldest and most widely deployed open-source OCR engine (60,000+ stars).

**Simple and proven.** Tesseract is the workhorse OCR engine that's been in production for decades. It's not the most accurate on complex layouts or handwriting, but it's reliable, fast, and runs everywhere. The MCP wrapper is minimal — one tool for PDF text extraction with multi-language support.

**The limitation:** Tesseract's accuracy on complex layouts, tables, and degraded images lags behind newer neural-network-based OCR engines like Surya, PaddleOCR, and commercial APIs. For simple, clean-text documents it's fine. For anything complex, you'll want a more capable engine.

## Multi-Model and Specialized

### ocr-mcp (Multi-Model OCR)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [sandraschi/ocr-mcp](https://github.com/sandraschi/ocr-mcp) | Low stars |
| License | MIT |
| Language | Python |
| Models | DeepSeek-OCR, Florence-2, DOTS.OCR, PP-OCRv5, Qwen-Image |

The most architecturally interesting OCR MCP server. Instead of wrapping a single OCR engine, ocr-mcp supports **five different models** — letting you pick the best engine for each document type.

**Why this matters:** No single OCR engine wins on every document type. DeepSeek-OCR excels on Chinese text. Florence-2 (Microsoft) handles natural scene text. PaddleOCR v5 is the best all-rounder. Qwen-Image is strong on mixed visual content. Having all five accessible through one MCP server means an AI agent could theoretically choose the best model per document.

**Also includes:** WIA scanner control (interact with physical scanners) and multi-format document processing for PDFs, CBZ comics, and images. The scanner integration is unique — no other OCR MCP server connects to hardware.

**Early stage.** Low stars, new project. The concept is ahead of the implementation's maturity, but it points toward where OCR MCP servers should go.

### Handwriting OCR MCP

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [Handwriting-OCR/handwriting-ocr-mcp-server](https://github.com/Handwriting-OCR/handwriting-ocr-mcp-server) | ~15 stars |
| Language | TypeScript/Node.js |
| Tools | 3 (upload, check status, retrieve results) |
| Auth | Handwriting OCR Platform API token |

The only MCP server focused specifically on **handwritten text recognition** — a fundamentally harder problem than printed text OCR. Most OCR engines are trained primarily on typed text and struggle with handwriting's variability.

**Async workflow:** upload an image, check processing status, retrieve results. This three-step pattern makes sense for handwriting recognition, which requires heavier processing than printed text OCR. Output is Markdown.

**Platform dependency:** requires a Handwriting OCR Platform account and API token. Not open-source OCR — it's a wrapper around a commercial service. But if you specifically need handwriting recognition through MCP, this is currently the only option.

### Unstructured MCP (Pipeline Orchestration)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [Unstructured-IO/UNS-MCP](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/UNS-MCP) | ~16 stars |
| Language | Python |
| Auth | Unstructured API key |

Not an OCR server per se, but worth mentioning: Unstructured is one of the most widely used document processing libraries in the AI ecosystem, and their MCP server manages document processing **workflows** — sources, destinations, pipeline jobs. Think of it as the orchestration layer for OCR and document extraction at scale, using Unstructured's cloud platform.

**Use case:** when you need to process thousands of documents through OCR pipelines, not just one image at a time. The MCP server manages the workflow; Unstructured's infrastructure does the heavy lifting.

## What's Missing

**No official Tesseract MCP server.** The most widely deployed OCR engine in the world (60K+ stars) has only community wrappers with minimal adoption. A quality Tesseract MCP server with proper configuration options (PSM modes, language packs, preprocessing) would fill a real gap.

**No Google Cloud Vision MCP server.** Google's Cloud Vision API is one of the highest-quality OCR services available, but there's no dedicated MCP server for it. The Gemini-based wrapper exists but uses vision models, not the dedicated OCR API.

**No AWS Textract MCP server.** Amazon Textract is the other major cloud OCR service. AWS ships a document loader MCP but not a Textract-specific server with table extraction, form parsing, and expense analysis.

**No dedicated receipt/invoice OCR.** This is one of the most common real-world OCR use cases, but no MCP server specializes in structured data extraction from receipts, invoices, or forms. PDF.co (covered in our [PDF review](/reviews/pdf-document-mcp-servers/)) has invoice parsing, but it's a paid wrapper.

**No real-time video OCR.** Screen text extraction, video subtitle extraction, or live camera OCR — none of these have MCP servers yet.

## How to Choose

**"I need the best open-source OCR"** → [PaddleOCR MCP](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR). Official vendor server, 100+ languages, runs locally. The clear first choice.

**"I want one server for many conversion types"** → [Markdownify MCP](https://github.com/zcaceres/markdownify-mcp). OCR plus PDF, audio, web, and more. 2,400 stars, MIT license.

**"I need the highest accuracy on complex layouts"** → [Marker MCP](https://github.com/moatasim-KT/Marker_MCP_Server) (uses Surya OCR) or Mistral OCR API (via [mcp-mistral-ocr](https://github.com/everaldo/mcp-mistral-ocr)). Both excel on tables, columns, and mixed content.

**"I need handwriting recognition"** → [Handwriting OCR MCP](https://github.com/Handwriting-OCR/handwriting-ocr-mcp-server). Only option. Requires API token.

**"I want to choose between multiple OCR engines"** → [ocr-mcp](https://github.com/sandraschi/ocr-mcp). Five models, early stage but architecturally sound.

**"I just need simple, reliable OCR"** → [EasyOCR MCP](https://github.com/WindoC/easyocr-mcp) or [Tesseract MCP](https://github.com/maximdx/tesseract-mcp-server). Proven engines, minimal setup.

## Rating: 3.0 / 5

The OCR MCP ecosystem has a notable gap between the quality of the underlying OCR engines and the quality of their MCP wrappers. PaddleOCR, Tesseract, EasyOCR, and Surya are all excellent, battle-tested OCR libraries — but their MCP integrations are young, minimally adopted, and often missing features that the parent libraries support.

PaddleOCR's official MCP server is the standout: backed by Baidu, properly maintained, and installed via pip. But beyond that, most servers have single-digit stars and unspecified licenses. The major cloud OCR providers (Google Cloud Vision, AWS Textract, Azure Computer Vision) are conspicuously absent — a significant gap given how many production OCR workflows rely on these services.

The multi-model approach (ocr-mcp) points toward the right future: AI agents choosing the best OCR engine per document type. But that future is still early. Today, if you need OCR through MCP, PaddleOCR is the safe choice, and Markdownify is the pragmatic choice if you need OCR alongside other document conversion.
