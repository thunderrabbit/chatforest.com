Compliance automation platforms are starting to ship MCP servers, giving AI agents access to the controls, tests, frameworks, and audit evidence that GRC teams manage daily. The pattern is clear: the three largest compliance automation vendors — Vanta, Drata, and Secureframe — all have MCP servers now. Open-source GRC platforms are following suit. Part of our **[Security & Compliance MCP category](/categories/security-compliance/)**.

This review covers **compliance automation platforms** (tools that help organizations achieve and maintain SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR, and similar certifications) and their MCP integrations. We've organized by vendor type: **commercial compliance platforms**, **open-source GRC tools**, and **MCP security governance** (tools that audit and govern MCP servers themselves for compliance).

## Vanta — Official Server

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [VantaInc/vanta-mcp-server](https://github.com/VantaInc/vanta-mcp-server) | ~41 stars |
| License | MIT |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Tools | 13 primary (43 total operations) |
| Status | Public preview |

Vanta's official MCP server is the most complete open-source compliance MCP server available. It covers the full breadth of Vanta's platform through 13 tool categories.

### What Works Well

**Broad tool coverage.** Controls, documents, frameworks, tests, integrations, people, risks, and vulnerabilities — all accessible through structured MCP tools. You can query failing controls, pull framework completion status, check integration health, and review CVE metadata on detected vulnerabilities.

**Real compliance workflows.** The tools map to actual GRC workflows: evidence collection (documents), access reviews (people), risk treatment (risks), vulnerability management (vulnerabilities with CVE details), and framework progress tracking. This isn't just a data dump — it's organized around how compliance teams actually work.

**Good engineering.** TypeScript with full type safety, automated tool registry discovery, DRY code structure, and OAuth authentication via Vanta's developer dashboard. The 8 contributors and 19 forks suggest active community engagement.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**Public preview.** Experimental status means breaking changes are possible. Vanta warns users to verify AI-generated responses before taking compliance or security actions.

**Requires Vanta subscription.** The MCP server is an interface to an existing Vanta deployment. The core package or above is required.

**OAuth setup required.** You need API credentials from Vanta's developer dashboard — not a simple API key, but a full OAuth flow. This adds friction for quick testing.

## Drata — Hosted Experimental Server

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [drata.com/mcp](https://drata.com/mcp) | Hosted service |
| Status | Experimental |
| Model | Hosted (no self-hosting) |

Drata takes a different approach: instead of publishing an open-source server, they host the MCP server for you. No local installation, no dependencies.

### What Works Well

**Zero-setup deployment.** Drata hosts the protocol in a hardened environment. You're connected in minutes without managing server infrastructure.

**AI-native design.** Built specifically for AI-native trust management. GRC teams, developers, and auditors can query compliance data with natural language through Claude, Cursor, or other MCP-compatible tools.

**Permission-bounded.** The MCP server operates within the read/write access already configured for your Drata account. No AI agent can access more than what's authorized.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**Not open source.** No public GitHub repository, no way to inspect the server code, no self-hosting option. For compliance teams that need to audit their own tools, this is a gap.

**Experimental status.** Drata labels this as experimental. Production SOC workflows shouldn't depend on it yet.

**Vendor lock-in.** The hosted model means you're entirely dependent on Drata's infrastructure and availability.

## Secureframe — Official Server

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [secureframe/secureframe-mcp-server](https://github.com/secureframe/secureframe-mcp-server) | ~6 stars |
| License | MIT |
| Language | Python |
| Tools | 11 read-only endpoints |
| Status | Public beta |

Secureframe's MCP server is read-only by design, which is a deliberate safety choice for a compliance platform.

### What Works Well

**Read-only safety model.** The server explicitly does not permit writes or destructive actions. For compliance data — where accidental modifications could affect audit evidence — this is the right default.

**Practical query surface.** 11 endpoints covering controls, tests, devices, users, vendors, frameworks, integrations, and repository mappings. The Lucene query syntax support enables precise filtering.

**Multi-framework querying.** Query across SOC 2, ISO 27001, CMMC, FedRAMP, and other frameworks simultaneously. Useful for organizations maintaining multiple certifications.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**Self-hosted only.** Unlike Drata's hosted approach, Secureframe requires you to run the server in your environment. More control, but more setup.

**Very early.** 6 stars and public beta status suggest limited adoption. The Python implementation is straightforward but the ecosystem around it is minimal.

**No write operations.** While read-only is safe, it limits automation. You can't update control statuses, assign remediation tasks, or manage evidence through MCP.

## CISO Assistant — Open-Source GRC with MCP

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [intuitem/ciso-assistant-community](https://github.com/intuitem/ciso-assistant-community) | ~3,700 stars |
| License | AGPL |
| Language | Python (backend), React (frontend) |
| Frameworks | 100+ (ISO 27001, NIST CSF, SOC 2, PCI DSS, NIS2, DORA, GDPR, HIPAA, CMMC, and more) |

CISO Assistant is the most popular open-source GRC platform, and it has MCP integration. This is the option for teams that want full control over their compliance data and tooling.

### What Works Well

**Framework breadth.** 100+ global compliance frameworks with automatic control mapping. The decoupling principle — separating frameworks from security controls — enables reusability across multiple assessments simultaneously. No commercial MCP server matches this framework coverage.

**Full GRC platform.** Risk management, AppSec, compliance and audit, third-party risk management (TPRM), privacy, and reporting — all in one platform with MCP access. This isn't just a compliance checker; it's a complete GRC workflow tool.

**API-first architecture.** MCP is one of several integration options alongside REST API, n8n, and Kafka. The API-first design means MCP gets access to the same capabilities as other integration methods.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**MCP stability issues.** A recent GitHub issue (#2922) reports that all POST/UPDATE operations are broken on the current main branch, with write operations returning GET responses. This suggests the MCP integration is still maturing.

**AGPL license.** The copyleft license may create complications for organizations that want to modify the MCP server and integrate it into proprietary workflows.

**Self-hosted complexity.** Running CISO Assistant requires Docker, a database, and more infrastructure than the single-binary compliance MCP servers from Vanta or Secureframe.

## ComplianceCow — Multi-Server Architecture

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| [ComplianceCow/cow-mcp](https://github.com/ComplianceCow/cow-mcp) | ~11 stars |
| Language | Python 3.11+ |
| Servers | 4 (Rules, Insights, Workflow, Assistant) |
| Tools | 27+ across all servers |

ComplianceCow takes a unique approach: four specialized MCP servers that handle different compliance functions.

### What Works Well

**Specialized servers.** The four-server architecture (Rules for compliance rule creation/execution, Insights for data querying and analytics, Workflow for automated compliance processes, Assistant for assessment and control management) provides cleaner separation of concerns than a single monolithic server.

**Evidence automation.** Integration with cloud infrastructure (AWS, Kubernetes, GitHub) and SQL-based evidence collection. The Compliance Graph continuously ingests assessment data from diverse sources.

**Workflow automation.** Event-driven workflow automation goes beyond data querying into active compliance management — creating rules, running assessments, and orchestrating remediation tasks.

### What Doesn't Work Well

**Very early stage.** 11 stars and limited documentation suggest this is a new entrant. The four-server architecture adds deployment complexity.

**Commercial platform dependency.** Like Vanta and Drata, you need a ComplianceCow account to use the MCP servers meaningfully.

## MCP Security Governance Tools

Beyond compliance platforms, a separate ecosystem is emerging for auditing and governing MCP servers themselves — ensuring your MCP deployments meet compliance requirements.

### Cloud Security Alliance — MCP Security Governance

The [CloudSecurityAlliance/mcp-security-governance](https://github.com/CloudSecurityAlliance/mcp-security-governance) repository provides governance frameworks for MCP adoption: vendor assessment tools, deployment best practices, organization policies, compliance guidance, and risk assessment methodologies. This is documentation and policy templates, not an MCP server — but it's the most authoritative governance resource for MCP compliance.

### mcpserver-audit (CSA Project)

[ModelContextProtocol-Security/mcpserver-audit](https://github.com/ModelContextProtocol-Security/mcpserver-audit) (~13 stars) audits MCP server source code for security vulnerabilities. Part of the Cloud Security Alliance's MCP Security initiative, it scores findings using AIVSS (AI Vulnerability Scoring System) and maps to CWE categories. Useful for organizations that need to audit MCP servers before deploying them in regulated environments.

### Minibridge (Acuvity)

[acuvity/minibridge](https://github.com/acuvity/minibridge) (~54 stars, Go, Apache 2.0) is a security bridge for MCP servers that adds TLS, client certificate validation, OPA Rego policy enforcement, OpenTelemetry tracing, and PII detection. For compliance teams, Minibridge provides the audit logging, authorization controls, and secrets redaction that production MCP deployments require.

### MintMCP

MintMCP is a commercial gateway with SOC 2 Type II certification for its MCP infrastructure. It generates audit logs in SOC 2, HIPAA, and GDPR-compliant formats and provides exportable audit trails for every tool invocation. For organizations where the MCP gateway itself needs to pass audit, MintMCP handles that compliance burden.

|-------|--------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Compliance platform | VantaInc/vanta-mcp-server | ~41 | Yes | 13 tools, 43 operations, MIT, most complete |
| Compliance platform | Drata MCP | — | Yes | Hosted, zero-setup, AI-native design |
| Compliance platform | secureframe/secureframe-mcp-server | ~6 | Yes | Read-only safety model, Lucene queries |
| GRC platform | intuitem/ciso-assistant-community | ~3,700 | Yes | 100+ frameworks, full GRC, AGPL |
| Compliance platform | ComplianceCow/cow-mcp | ~11 | Yes | 4 servers, 27+ tools, evidence automation |
| MCP governance | acuvity/minibridge | ~54 | No | OPA policies, TLS, PII detection, Apache 2.0 |
| MCP audit | mcpserver-audit | ~13 | CSA | AIVSS scoring, CWE mapping |

## Who Should Use What

**GRC teams at Vanta/Drata/Secureframe customers** — Use your vendor's MCP server. Vanta's is the most mature (13 tools, open source), Drata's is the easiest to set up (hosted), and Secureframe's is the safest (read-only). These let you query compliance status, identify failing controls, and generate reports through AI assistants.

**Open-source GRC users** — CISO Assistant is the clear choice with 100+ frameworks, 3,700 stars, and an active community. The MCP integration is still maturing (check issue #2922), but the platform itself is production-ready.

**Platform engineering teams** — If you need to make MCP deployments themselves compliant, look at Minibridge (OPA policy enforcement, TLS, audit logging) or MintMCP (SOC 2 Type II certified gateway). These solve a different problem: not "how do I query compliance data via MCP" but "how do I make my MCP infrastructure compliant."

**Auditors and security reviewers** — mcpserver-audit from the Cloud Security Alliance helps audit MCP servers before deployment. Useful when your compliance framework requires reviewing third-party tools.

## What's Missing

- **Sprinto** — No MCP server from this growing compliance platform
- **OneLeet** — No MCP server despite their all-in-one compliance approach
- **Open Policy Agent (OPA)** — Only an auto-generated REST API wrapper exists; no purpose-built policy-as-code MCP server
- **NIST/CIS benchmark automation** — No dedicated MCP servers for running benchmark assessments
- **Audit firm tooling** — No MCP servers designed for external auditors (Big 4, regional firms)
- **Privacy-specific tools** — No dedicated GDPR/CCPA privacy management MCP servers (OneTrust, TrustArc, etc.)

## Bottom Line

**Rating: 3.5 / 5** — Compliance automation MCP support is real but early. The big three commercial platforms (Vanta, Drata, Secureframe) all have MCP servers, which signals genuine vendor commitment to AI-native compliance workflows. Vanta leads with the most complete open-source implementation (13 tools, MIT license, TypeScript). CISO Assistant brings the open-source GRC perspective with unmatched framework coverage (100+ frameworks). The MCP governance ecosystem (Minibridge, mcpserver-audit, MintMCP, CSA frameworks) addresses the meta-question of making MCP itself compliant. The main weaknesses are maturity — most servers are in preview/experimental/beta — and the absence of purpose-built servers for policy-as-code, privacy management, and external audit workflows. This category will improve quickly as compliance platforms invest more in AI agent interfaces.
