**At a glance:** [mcp.dropbox.com/mcp](https://help.dropbox.com/integrations/connect-dropbox-mcp-server) (official remote server, beta) + [dropbox/mcp-server-dash](https://github.com/dropbox/mcp-server-dash) (9 stars, official, Python, Apache-2.0). Dropbox is one of the few companies offering two official MCP servers.

Dropbox MCP servers let AI agents **manage your cloud files and search across your entire workspace** — browse folders, read file contents, upload and download documents, search across 30+ connected apps through Dash, and manage sharing links — all through natural language prompts. Notably, **Dropbox has published two official MCP servers**: one for core file operations and one for their AI-powered Dash universal search.

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) was founded in 2007 in San Francisco by **Drew Houston** and **Arash Ferdowsi**, both MIT students. The company went public on NASDAQ in March 2018 (ticker: DBX). As of early 2026: **~$2.52 billion annual revenue** (FY 2025, slight YoY decline of ~1%), **~$6.0–6.4 billion market cap**, and approximately **2,113 employees**. Drew Houston remains CEO. Key products beyond cloud storage include Dropbox Dash (AI universal search), Dropbox Sign (e-signatures, formerly HelloSign), and DocSend (document tracking). Dropbox's 2026 strategy centers on becoming an "AI-first cloud workspace" with Dash as the flagship AI product.

**Architecture note:** The official remote MCP server at `mcp.dropbox.com/mcp` is a hosted service — no local installation required. The Dash MCP server is available both as a remote endpoint (`mcp.dropbox.com/dash`) and as an open-source Python package on GitHub. Community servers wrap the Dropbox HTTP API v2, using OAuth 2.0 for authentication.

## What It Does

Between the two official servers and community implementations, Dropbox MCP servers cover four main capability areas:

### File Management

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Dropbox Remote (Official) | Dash (Official) | dbx-mcp-server | ngs/dropbox | Koswu/paper |
|---------|--------------------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Stars | N/A (hosted) | 9 | 26 | 3 | 1 |
| Language | Hosted service | Python | TypeScript | Go | Python |
| License | Proprietary | Apache-2.0 | MIT | MIT | None |

| Large file upload | TBD | No | No | Yes (150MB+) | No |
| Paper support | No | No | No | No | Yes |
| npm/brew install | N/A | pip | npm build | brew | pip |

**Key differentiator:** Dropbox is uniquely positioned with **two complementary official servers**. The remote server at `mcp.dropbox.com/mcp` handles core file operations with zero local setup. The Dash server searches across 30+ connected apps — not just Dropbox but Slack, Google Drive, Confluence, GitHub, and more — making it a workspace-wide AI search tool. The most popular community server (dbx-mcp-server, 26 stars) fills the gap with full CRUD operations, sharing management, and encrypted token storage.

## Dropbox Pricing

The MCP servers themselves are free. Dropbox pricing determines what data your agent can access:

| Plan | Price | Storage | Key Features |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| Basic (Free) | $0 | 2 GB | File sync, sharing, 3 devices |
| Plus | $11.99/month | 2 TB | 30-day version history, remote wipe |
| Essentials | $22/month | 3 TB | 180-day version history, PDF editing, video tools |
| Business | $15/user/month | 9 TB (team) | Admin console, audit log, SSO |
| Business Plus | $24/user/month | 15 TB (team) | Extended version history, compliance tools |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom | Advanced security, Dash AI, dedicated support |

*Prices with annual billing. Monthly billing is higher.*

**Dash availability:** Dropbox Dash (the AI universal search that the Dash MCP server provides) requires a **Business or Enterprise plan** with Dash enabled. Individual plans do not include Dash.

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **OAuth complexity** — Every implementation requires creating a Dropbox App at the [App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps), configuring granular scopes (`files.metadata.read`, `files.content.read`, `files.content.write`, `sharing.write`, etc.), and managing OAuth 2.0 tokens. Short-lived access tokens expire in ~4 hours; refresh tokens require app key + secret.

2. **Scope changes require re-auth** — If you modify your Dropbox app permissions (e.g., adding the sharing scope after initial setup), you must regenerate tokens and re-authenticate from scratch. This creates friction when incrementally expanding an MCP server's capabilities.

3. **Undocumented rate limits** — Dropbox does not publish specific rate limit numbers. Rate-limited responses may include a `Retry-After` header, but there are no per-endpoint quotas in the documentation. The API docs recommend exponential backoff, leaving developers guessing.

4. **Dash requires Business plan** — The most powerful official MCP feature — cross-app universal search via Dash — requires a Dropbox Business or Enterprise plan. Individual users cannot access this capability.

5. **Single maintainer risk** — The most popular community server (dbx-mcp-server, 26 stars) has a single contributor with 19 commits. Most community implementations also have solo maintainers.

6. **No real-time sync** — MCP servers access Dropbox files on-demand via API. They do not provide real-time file change notifications or sync events. If files change between requests, the agent won't know unless it re-queries.

7. **Large file handling** — Only the Go implementation (ngs/dropbox-mcp-server) supports chunked uploads for files over 150MB. Other implementations may fail or timeout on large files.

8. **Paper support gap** — Only one specialized community server (Koswu/dropbox-paper-mcp) addresses Paper documents. The official servers and the most popular community server do not support Paper. Open issue #5 on dbx-mcp-server requests this.

9. **Monthly upload caps** — Business accounts have monthly upload caps that return 403 errors when exceeded. An AI agent uploading many files could hit these limits without warning.

10. **Token encryption friction** — The dbx-mcp-server requires a 32+ character `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` for token storage, adding setup complexity. Less security-conscious implementations store tokens in plaintext.

## The Bottom Line

Dropbox earns a rare distinction in our reviews: **two official MCP servers from the company itself**. The remote server at `mcp.dropbox.com/mcp` provides zero-installation file access — just add the URL to your MCP client and authenticate in-browser. The open-source Dash server goes further, turning AI agents into **cross-platform knowledge search tools** that can query Slack, Google Drive, Confluence, GitHub, Jira, and 20+ other apps through a single interface. That cross-app capability is genuinely unique in the MCP ecosystem.

The practical value is clear. Ask your AI agent to find that contract you know is somewhere in Dropbox, search across every app your team uses for mentions of a project, or have the agent organize files based on content analysis. For teams already on Dropbox Business with Dash enabled, the search capabilities alone justify the integration.

Where it falls short: the community ecosystem is modest (26 stars at the top), OAuth setup remains friction-heavy, Dropbox's undocumented rate limits leave developers guessing, and the Dash universal search — arguably the most compelling feature — is locked behind Business/Enterprise pricing. Paper document support is nearly absent, with only one specialized community server addressing it. And the remote MCP server is still in beta with limited documentation about its full capabilities.

**Rating: 4 / 5** — One of the strongest official MCP commitments we've reviewed: two company-maintained servers covering both core file operations (hosted, zero-install) and AI-powered universal search across 30+ apps (open-source, Apache-2.0). The ~$2.52B revenue platform backs a mature API with broad file management capabilities. Community ecosystem adds full CRUD operations (26 stars), Homebrew-installable Go server with large file support, and specialized Paper and Sign servers. Loses a point for Business plan requirement for the most compelling feature (Dash universal search), OAuth complexity with short-lived tokens, undocumented rate limits, modest community adoption, and the remote server's beta status with limited public documentation. Best suited for teams already on Dropbox Business who want AI agents to search across their entire workspace, and individual users who need AI-powered file management.
