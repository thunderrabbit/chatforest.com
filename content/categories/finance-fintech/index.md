We've reviewed **9 categories** of Finance & Fintech MCP servers, evaluating over **300 individual servers** across payments, e-commerce, cryptocurrency, personal finance, accounting, tax compliance, and blockchain. Each review covers architecture patterns, star counts, tool inventories, known issues, and honest ratings.

Finance is one of the most commercially mature MCP categories. Payment giants (Stripe, PayPal, Square) have all shipped official servers. Crypto and DeFi ecosystems are exploding with community tooling. The pattern is clear: financial operations that once required custom API integrations are becoming accessible through MCP — giving AI agents the ability to process payments, manage invoices, trade assets, and analyze financial data.

The payments space is dominated by official vendor servers. Stripe leads with 1,400 stars and best-in-class security. PayPal covers the broadest operational surface with 30+ tools. Square takes a unique meta-tool approach to expose 40+ API services. E-commerce platforms are equally invested — Shopify pioneered a zero-auth MCP endpoint on every store.
