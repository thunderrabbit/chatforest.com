We've reviewed **26 Database MCP servers** — 12 category-level reviews plus 14 individual server deep-dives — evaluating over **100 individual servers** across the entire data layer. Each review covers architecture patterns, star counts, tool inventories, known issues, and honest ratings.

The database category spans everything from traditional relational databases to specialized engines for vectors, graphs, and time-series data — plus cross-database administration tools.

## Early Single-Server Reviews

Our earliest database reviews focused on Anthropic's reference server implementations — since archived and superseded by the comprehensive reviews above.

| Review | Rating | Key Servers |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [The PostgreSQL MCP Server](/reviews/postgres-mcp-server/) | 2.5/5 | Anthropic's archived reference server — read-only protection that wasn't |
| [The SQLite MCP Server](/reviews/sqlite-mcp-server/) | 2.5/5 | Anthropic's archived reference server — a good idea, now abandoned |

## Category Overview

Across all 12 reviews, key themes emerge:

**PostgreSQL dominates.** With a 4.5/5 rating and servers from Google (Toolbox, 13.5k stars), Supabase (2.6k stars), and Postgres MCP Pro (2.4k stars), PostgreSQL has the deepest MCP ecosystem of any database. It's not even close.

**Official vendor servers are the exception, not the rule.** MongoDB (970 stars, 40+ tools) is the gold standard for vendor-built database MCP servers. Redis, ClickHouse, and Neo4j have official offerings too. But MySQL, SQL Server, and SQLite rely almost entirely on community-built servers.

**DBHub is the universal bridge.** Appearing across multiple reviews with 2.4k stars, DBHub provides a single MCP interface to PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, DuckDB, and more — solving the multi-database problem that individual servers can't.

**Vector databases reflect the AI moment.** Qdrant (1.3k stars), Chroma, Milvus, Pinecone, and Weaviate all have MCP servers. This category barely existed a year ago and is now one of the most active.

**Database migration is the weakest link.** At 2.5/5, it's the lowest-rated database category. Prisma ships built-in MCP, but Flyway, Alembic, and most migration tools have no official support — a gap that matters as AI agents increasingly need to manage schema changes.

**The comparison tables tell the real story.** The gap between PostgreSQL (4.5/5) and Database Migration (2.5/5) reveals where the ecosystem is mature and where it still needs work.
