We've reviewed **8 major AI providers** and their MCP server ecosystems, evaluating how each company — from the protocol's creator to cloud giants and open-weight champions — connects to the Model Context Protocol.

Every major AI provider now has some MCP presence, but the depth varies enormously. The gap between the leaders (Anthropic, AWS) and the rest tells you who sees MCP as strategic infrastructure versus who's checking a box.

## Category Overview

Across all 8 reviews, clear patterns emerge:

**Anthropic created the protocol — and it shows.** With the specification itself, 81.8k-star reference servers, both official SDKs, and MCP Inspector (9.2k stars), Anthropic doesn't just participate in the MCP ecosystem — it *is* the ecosystem's foundation. The 4.5/5 rating reflects depth no other provider matches at the protocol level.

**AWS treats MCP as infrastructure.** 68 official servers covering S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, CDK, Bedrock, and dozens more AWS services. At 8,540 stars and counting, awslabs/mcp is the largest single-vendor MCP repository by server count. The 4.5/5 rating ties Anthropic — but for breadth rather than depth.

**Google goes wide, OpenAI goes narrow.** Google ships 24+ official MCP servers through google/mcp and has Gemini CLI at 98.7k stars. OpenAI has no official MCP server at all — community bridges fill the gap, but at 197 stars for the leading one, the ecosystem is thin. The difference? Google sees MCP as a way to connect its service portfolio; OpenAI sees its Agents SDK as the primary integration path.

**Open-weight providers rely on community.** Meta's Llama Stack (8,300 stars) supports MCP tool calling, and ollama-mcp-bridge (972 stars) connects local models to MCP servers. But neither Meta nor Mistral ships a dedicated MCP server. The community fills gaps, but adoption stays modest compared to cloud providers.

**Enterprise AI lags behind.** Cohere's North MCP SDK has just 11 stars — the lowest of any official provider server in our reviews. Enterprise AI companies see MCP as one integration among many, not a strategic priority. This may change as agentic workflows mature.

**The real story is convergence.** Every major AI provider now either ships MCP servers, supports MCP in their client tools, or both. The question is no longer *if* a provider will support MCP, but *how deeply*. The 4.5/5-to-2.5/5 rating spread shows where that depth currently lives.
