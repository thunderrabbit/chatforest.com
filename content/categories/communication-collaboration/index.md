We've reviewed **15 categories** of Communication & Collaboration MCP servers, evaluating over **250 individual servers** across workplace messaging, email, project management, calendars, video conferencing, social networking, and telecommunications. Each review covers architecture patterns, star counts, tool inventories, known issues, and honest ratings.

This is the most vendor-active category we've reviewed. Slack, Microsoft, Linear, Asana, and Notion all ship official MCP servers — a sharp contrast to categories like [Databases](/categories/databases/) where community servers dominate.

## Workplace Messaging

The platforms where teams communicate daily. Slack leads with a hosted official server; Microsoft followed; Discord is still community-only.

| Review | Rating | Key Servers |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [Slack MCP Server](/reviews/slack-mcp-server/) | 4/5 | Official server at `mcp.slack.com` (~15 tools, 50+ partners, Streamable HTTP, OAuth) |
| [Microsoft Teams](/reviews/teams-mcp-servers/) | 3.5/5 | Work IQ Teams (official, 24 tools), InditexTech (community), floriscornel (community) |
| [Discord](/reviews/discord-mcp-servers/) | 3/5 | 5 community servers, no official — largest has 134 tools but fragmented landscape |

## Email

Giving agents inbox access is high-value but high-risk. Gmail and Outlook both have working MCP integrations, though Gmail's are entirely community-built.

| Review | Rating | Key Servers |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [Gmail MCP Servers](/reviews/gmail-mcp-servers/) | 3.5/5 | Community-built, OAuth via Google API — proceed with caution on send permissions |
| [Outlook MCP Servers](/reviews/outlook-mcp-servers/) | 3.5/5 | Microsoft's enterprise email meets the agent era — Graph API, community servers |

## Project Management

The strongest sub-category. Linear and Asana ship polished official servers with OAuth and remote hosting. Notion bridges note-taking and project management.

| Review | Rating | Key Servers |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [Linear MCP Server](/reviews/linear-mcp-server/) | 4/5 | Official remote server at `mcp.linear.app` (23+ tools, OAuth 2.1, Streamable HTTP) |
| [Asana MCP Server](/reviews/asana-mcp-server/) | 4/5 | Official at `mcp.asana.com` (44 tools, Work Graph access, OAuth, V2 Feb 2026) |
| [Notion MCP Server](/reviews/notion-mcp-server/) | 3.5/5 | Official (4,100+ stars, 18+ tools, npm v2.2.1) + hosted OAuth server — 104 open issues |

## Calendar & Scheduling

Calendar access is a gateway to autonomous scheduling. Google Calendar's community server leads; the broader landscape spans 35+ servers across 7 subcategories.

| Review | Rating | Key Servers |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [Google Calendar](/reviews/google-calendar-mcp-server/) | 4/5 | nspady/google-calendar-mcp (1,100+ stars, 13 tools, multi-account, v2.6.1) |
| [Calendar & Scheduling](/reviews/calendar-scheduling-mcp-servers/) | 4/5 | 35+ servers — Google, Outlook, Apple, Cal.com, Calendly, CalDAV, multi-provider |

## Video Conferencing

Meeting management through MCP — transcripts, recordings, scheduling. Zoom has platform MCP support but no standalone server.

| Review | Rating | Key Servers |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [Zoom MCP Servers](/reviews/zoom-mcp-server/) | 3/5 | echelon-ai-labs/zoom-mcp (26 stars), AI Studio integration — no official standalone |
| [Video Conferencing](/reviews/video-conferencing-mcp-servers/) | 3.5/5 | Joinly, Vexa, tl;dv, Meeting BaaS — meeting intelligence and transcription |

## Telecommunications & CPaaS

The infrastructure layer — SMS, voice, WhatsApp, Telegram through CPaaS platforms. The highest-rated sub-category in Communication & Collaboration.

| Review | Rating | Key Servers |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [Telecom & Communications](/reviews/telecommunications-communications-mcp-servers/) | 4/5 | Twilio, Telnyx, Vonage, Sinch, Plivo, Cisco Meraki, NetBox |
| [Telecom & Messaging](/reviews/telecommunications-messaging-mcp-servers/) | 4.5/5 | SMS, Voice, WhatsApp, Telegram — CPaaS and unified communications |

## Social Networking & Community

The platforms where online communities form and interact — from Twitter/X and Bluesky to Reddit, Discord, Mastodon, and LinkedIn.

| Review | Rating | Key Servers |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [Social Networking & Community](/reviews/social-networking-community-mcp-servers/) | 4.5/5 | twitter-mcp (373 stars), mcp-twitter-server (53 tools), bluesky-mcp (official repo), mcp-linkedin (177 stars), discord-mcp (134 tools) — 50+ servers |

## Category Overview

**15 reviews. 250+ servers. Average rating: 3.7/5.**

### What stands out

**Official servers dominate.** Slack, Microsoft Teams, Linear, Asana, and Notion all ship first-party MCP servers with OAuth and remote hosting. This is the most vendor-committed category we've reviewed — compare [Developer Tools](/categories/developer-tools/) where community servers still outnumber official ones in most subcategories.

**Project management is the strongest sub-category.** Linear (4/5) and Asana (4/5) set the standard for what official MCP servers should look like: hosted, OAuth-authenticated, well-documented, actively maintained. Notion's 4,100+ stars show massive community interest despite 104 open issues.

**Telecom punches above its weight.** The Telecom & Messaging review (4.5/5) is the highest-rated in this entire category — CPaaS platforms like Twilio and Telnyx have embraced MCP more thoroughly than most consumer communication tools.

**Email is the riskiest integration.** Gmail and Outlook MCP servers work, but giving an AI agent send permissions on your email is a trust decision most teams aren't ready for. Both reviews flag security and permission concerns.

**Discord is the notable absence.** 200M+ monthly active users, massive developer community, zero official MCP support. The five community servers are fragmented and none has broken 200 stars.

**Calendar is a gateway to autonomy.** Once an agent can check availability, create events, and coordinate schedules, it crosses from "assistant that reads" to "assistant that acts." The Google Calendar community server (1,100+ stars) shows this is one of the most-wanted integrations.

### The vendor adoption pattern

Communication & Collaboration reveals a clear pattern: **platforms that sell to developers and enterprises ship MCP servers first.** Slack (developer-friendly, API-first), Linear (developer-native PM), Asana (enterprise PM) — all had official servers within months of MCP's launch. Discord (gaming/community-first) and Zoom (meeting-centric) lag behind with community-only support.
