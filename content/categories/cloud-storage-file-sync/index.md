We've reviewed **5 categories** of cloud storage and file access MCP servers, evaluating over **40 individual servers** across the major consumer and enterprise platforms plus the foundational local filesystem. Each review covers architecture patterns, star counts, tool inventories, known issues, and honest ratings.

File access is the most fundamental capability an AI agent can have. These servers span the full spectrum — from Anthropic's reference Filesystem implementation (the server most people install first) to Google Drive's massive community ecosystem, Dropbox's pioneering remote MCP approach, Microsoft's enterprise-focused OneDrive integration, and Apple's notably lagging iCloud support. The gap between the best and worst here is stark: Google and Dropbox deliver polished, production-ready experiences while iCloud can't even access files.

## Consumer & Enterprise Cloud Storage

The major cloud storage platforms — each with a different MCP strategy. Google and Dropbox lead with official servers and deep community support. OneDrive has enterprise features but restrictive licensing. iCloud is years behind.

| Review | Rating | Key Servers |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [Google Drive](/reviews/google-drive-mcp-server/) | 4/5 | google/mcp (3.4K stars, official, Workspace-wide), taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp (1.9K stars, 12 services), google-docs-mcp (403 stars, deep document editing), mcp-gdrive (272 stars, community pioneer) |
| [Dropbox](/reviews/dropbox-mcp-server/) | 4/5 | Dropbox Remote (official, hosted, no install), Dash MCP (9 stars, official, 30+ app search), amgadabdelhafez (26 stars, full file CRUD), ngs/dropbox (3 stars, comprehensive API) |
| [OneDrive](/reviews/onedrive-mcp-server/) | 3.5/5 | Work IQ (official, 13 tools, sensitivity labels, $30/user/month Copilot req.), Softeria (552 stars, file + mail + calendar), lokka (229 stars, full file ops), pnp/cli-microsoft365 (88 stars, 16 M365 services) |
| [iCloud](/reviews/icloud-mcp-server/) | 2.5/5 | apple-mcp (3K stars, archived, macOS-native), MrGo2 (5 stars, CalDAV/CardDAV), minagishl (4 stars, iCloud Drive read), mike-tih (2 stars, reminders) — no file storage access, critical gap |

## Local File Access

The foundational filesystem server — Anthropic's reference implementation and the most-installed MCP server in the ecosystem.

| Review | Rating | Key Servers |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [Filesystem](/reviews/filesystem-mcp-server/) | 4.5/5 | @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem (81.6K monorepo stars, 137K+ weekly npm downloads, 14 tools, Apache 2.0) — reference implementation with partial reads, media support, dry-run edits, Docker sandboxing, and MCP Roots protocol |

## Category Overview

**5 reviews. 40+ servers. Average rating: 3.7/5.**

The most striking pattern across cloud storage MCP is the **divergence in vendor commitment**. Google has both an official server and a thriving 3.4K-star community. Dropbox pioneered remote (hosted) MCP servers — no installation required. Microsoft gates its best features behind a $30/user/month Copilot license. And Apple has done nothing official, leaving a 3K-star archived project as the best option.

**Key gap**: No unified multi-cloud file server exists. If you work across Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive, you need three separate MCP server configurations. The Filesystem server handles local files excellently but can't bridge to cloud storage.
