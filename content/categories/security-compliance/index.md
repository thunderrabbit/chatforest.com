We've reviewed **13 categories** of Security & Compliance MCP servers, evaluating over **325 individual servers** across application security, threat intelligence, incident response, identity & authentication, compliance automation, privacy, and network security. Each review covers architecture patterns, star counts, tool inventories, known issues, and honest ratings.

Security is where enterprise MCP adoption faces its highest stakes. When AI agents scan code, query threat feeds, or manage compliance workflows, the cost of failure isn't a broken build — it's a breach, a missed detection, or a regulatory penalty. The good news: major security vendors (CrowdStrike, Google, Snyk, Semgrep, SonarQube) are investing heavily in MCP integrations.

## Application Security

Where AppSec vendors are racing to instrument AI coding agents. Code security and security scanning overlap — both cover SAST, SCA, and secrets detection — but code security takes the broader platform view while security scanning focuses on the vendor landscape.

| Review | Rating | Key Servers |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [Code Security](/reviews/code-security-mcp-servers/) | 4/5 | Snyk (11 tools, SAST/SCA/IaC/containers), SonarQube (423 stars), Semgrep (639 stars, archived into CLI) |
| [Security Scanning](/reviews/security-scanning-mcp-servers/) | 3.5/5 | Semgrep CLI-native (7 tools, 5,000+ rules), SonarQube (442 stars), GitGuardian (500+ detectors), Trivy (containers/IaC) |
| [Semgrep MCP Server](/reviews/semgrep-mcp-server/) | 4/5 | MCP built into Semgrep binary — SAST, SCA, Secrets across 5,000+ rules |
| [AI Agent Supply Chain Security](/reviews/ai-agent-supply-chain-security-mcp-servers/) | 3.5/5 | Snyk Agent Scan (1,900 stars), Docker MCP Gateway (1,300 stars), Cisco MCP Scanner (850 stars) |

## Threat Intelligence & Incident Response

The strongest security sub-category. Official servers from CrowdStrike and Google anchor the ecosystem. DFIR tools span the full incident lifecycle from detection through forensic analysis.

| Review | Rating | Key Servers |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [Threat Intelligence](/reviews/threat-intelligence-mcp-servers/) | 4/5 | Google TI MCP (450 stars), CrowdStrike Falcon (118 stars, 40+ tools), Shodan (116 stars), VirusTotal (113 stars) |
| [Digital Forensics & Incident Response](/reviews/digital-forensics-incident-response-mcp-servers/) | 4/5 | CrowdStrike, Google, TheHive, REMnux (official); Volatility, VirusTotal, YARA, Wazuh (community) |

## Compliance & Governance

Enterprise compliance platforms have all shipped MCP servers. Three distinct reviews cover different angles: automation platforms (Vanta, Drata, Secureframe), audit infrastructure (gateways, policy proxies, logging), and data governance (catalogs, metadata, data quality).

| Review | Rating | Key Servers |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [Compliance & Data Governance](/reviews/compliance-data-governance-mcp-servers/) | 4/5 | Vanta (41 stars, 13 tools), Secureframe (11 endpoints), Drata, CISO Assistant (100+ frameworks), DataHub (62 stars) |
| [Compliance & Audit Automation](/reviews/compliance-audit-automation-mcp-servers/) | 3.5/5 | Vanta, Drata, Secureframe all in preview/beta; CISO Assistant for open-source GRC; MintMCP, Minibridge for MCP governance |
| [Compliance & Audit](/reviews/compliance-audit-mcp-servers/) | 3.5/5 | Agentic MCP Gateway Registry (485 stars), Vanta MCP (13 tools), SentinelGate (policy enforcement proxy) |

## Privacy & Data Protection

Enterprise vendors are moving faster than open source here. The regulatory pressure from GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA is driving vendor investment.

| Review | Rating | Key Servers |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [Privacy & Data Protection](/reviews/privacy-data-protection-mcp-servers/) | 3/5 | BigID (28+ tools), DataGrail Vera (OAuth 2.0), Nightfall AI (DLP for MCP), mcp-server-conceal (Rust, PII proxy) |

## Identity & Authentication

Identity providers and authentication platforms connected to AI agents. Covers Okta, Auth0, Keycloak, Entra ID, AWS Cognito, and the MCP Auth Proxy for OAuth 2.1 compliance.

| Review | Rating | Key Servers |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [Identity & Authentication](/reviews/identity-authentication-mcp-servers/) | 3.5/5 | Okta, Auth0, Keycloak, Casdoor, Entra ID, AWS Cognito, MCP Auth Proxy (OAuth 2.1) — 25+ servers |

## Network Security

Active and growing, with official vendor support from PortSwigger (Burp Suite) and comprehensive community suites. The distributed diagnostics sub-category (Globalping, ProbeOps) is genuinely innovative.

| Review | Rating | Key Servers |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [Network Security](/reviews/network-security-mcp-servers/) | 3.5/5 | PortSwigger/Burp Suite (official), ZAP, FuzzingLabs, pentest-mcp, Globalping, ProbeOps |

## Category Overview

**13 reviews. 325+ servers. Average rating: 3.7/5.**

### What stands out

**Major security vendors are all-in on MCP.** CrowdStrike, Google, Snyk, Semgrep, SonarQube, PortSwigger, GitGuardian, Trivy, Cycode, and Contrast have all shipped official MCP servers. This isn't a community-driven category — the vendors themselves see AI agent integration as strategic.

**Threat intelligence and DFIR are the most mature sub-categories.** Both score 4/5, anchored by official servers from CrowdStrike (40+ tools across 16 modules) and Google (part of a security mono-repo covering TI, Chronicle SIEM, SCC, and SOAR). The community has built mature integrations for every significant open-source CTI platform.

**Compliance has breadth but not depth.** All three major compliance platforms (Vanta, Drata, Secureframe) have MCP servers, which signals genuine vendor commitment. But most are in preview/experimental/beta — the gap between "we have an MCP server" and "it's production-ready" is wide in this space.

**AI agent supply chain security is an entirely new domain.** The MCP ecosystem has created its own attack surface — 66% of 1,808 scanned MCP servers had security findings. Snyk Agent Scan (1,900 stars) and Docker MCP Gateway (1,300 stars) lead the response.

**Privacy is the weakest link.** At 3/5, privacy & data protection has the lowest rating in the category. Enterprise vendors (BigID, DataGrail, Nightfall, Skyflow) are investing, but open-source options are scarce (single-digit stars). No servers exist for consent management, differential privacy, or advanced data masking.

**AppSec follows two architectural patterns.** CLI-integrated servers (Semgrep, Snyk, Cycode) embed MCP into existing CLI tools. Standalone servers (SonarQube, GitGuardian, Trivy, Contrast) are separate repos connecting via API. The CLI-integrated approach is winning because it avoids duplicating scanner logic.

### The enterprise readiness gap

Security & Compliance reveals MCP's biggest enterprise challenge: **the tools exist, but production readiness varies wildly.** Threat intelligence servers are mature enough for real SOC workflows. Compliance servers are mostly beta. Network security servers have known security vulnerabilities (ironic for security tools). Privacy servers are early-stage. Organizations evaluating MCP for security use cases should expect to pilot with threat intel and AppSec first, then expand as compliance and privacy tools mature.
