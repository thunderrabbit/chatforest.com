We've reviewed **4 categories** of Sports & Fitness MCP servers, evaluating over **150 individual servers** across live sports data, athletic analytics, fitness wearable platforms, and workout tracking. Each review covers architecture patterns, star counts, tool inventories, known issues, and honest ratings.

Sports & Fitness is one of the most community-driven MCP categories. The ecosystem spans from comprehensive multi-sport APIs (Balldontlie covering 18 leagues with 250+ endpoints) to deep fitness wearable integrations (Garmin at 96+ tools, Strava at 25 tools, WHOOP with 6+ implementations). Formula 1 is the most over-served single sport with 7+ independent MCP servers. The pattern: every major fitness platform and many professional sports leagues now have community-built MCP interfaces — but not a single major platform has shipped an official server.

## Sports Data & Live Scores

The broadest subcategory. Multi-sport platforms cover all major leagues, while individual sports like Formula 1, MLB, and cricket have dedicated deep-dive servers. Fantasy sports and betting odds add the engagement layer. Fitness tracking servers overlap significantly — Garmin and Strava appear across multiple reviews with consistently high star counts.

|--------|--------|-------------|
| [Sports & Athletics](/reviews/sports-athletics-mcp-servers/) | 4/5 | garmin_mcp (271 stars, 96+ tools), strava-mcp (276 stars, 25 tools), formula1-mcp (15 stars, 29 tools), balldontlie-mcp (23 stars, NBA/NFL/MLB), ESPN Fantasy Football (29 stars), BetTrack (30+ tools, 70+ markets), cricket-mcp-server (11 stars, 9 tools) — 50+ servers |

## Analytics & Performance

Focused on data analysis — F1 telemetry modeling, betting odds analytics, and multi-platform fitness aggregation. The Pierre server stands out by connecting 150+ wearables through a single MCP interface. ESPN-based multi-sport data provides broad league coverage with real-time scores.

| Review | Rating | Key Servers |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [Sports & Fitness Analytics](/reviews/sports-fitness-analytics-mcp-servers/) | 4/5 | strava-mcp (238 stars, 24 tools), garmin-connect-mcp (61 tools), pierre_mcp_server (150+ wearables via Terra), f1-mcp-server (7 stars, FastF1), BetTrack (30+ tools, 70+ markets), domestique (Whoop + TrainerRoad), mcp-sports (ESPN live scores for 6+ leagues) — 25+ servers |

## Wearables & Health Tracking

The deepest subcategory. Every major fitness wearable brand has community-built MCP servers — Strava leads in implementation count (7+), Garmin in tool depth (96+), and WHOOP in language diversity (TypeScript, Ruby, Go). Open Wearables (915 stars) is evolving into the unified health data platform, supporting 6 wearable ecosystems through a single interface.

| Review | Rating | Key Servers |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [Fitness & Wearables](/reviews/fitness-wearables-mcp-servers/) | 4/5 | Open Wearables (915 stars, 6 platforms), garmin_mcp (96+ tools), whoop-mcp (6+ implementations, 18+ endpoints), oura-mcp-server (20 tools, anomaly detection), strava-mcp (7+ implementations), mcp-fitbit (12 tools), pierre_mcp_server (150+ wearables), ai-endurance/mcp (ML race predictions) — 40+ servers |

## Category Overview

**4 reviews. 150+ servers. Average rating: 4.0/5.**

### What stands out

**Garmin Connect is the most comprehensive fitness MCP server anywhere.** Taxuspt/garmin_mcp implements 96+ tools covering 89% of the python-garminconnect library — activities, health metrics, sleep, stress, nutrition, workouts, devices, and challenges. At 270+ stars, it's one of the highest-starred servers in any MCP category outside of core developer tools.

**Strava has the most community implementations of any fitness platform.** Seven independent MCP servers reflect the running and cycling community's enthusiasm for AI-powered training analysis. r-huijts/strava-mcp leads at 276 stars with 25 tools and zero-install npx usage.

**Formula 1 is absurdly well-served.** Seven or more independent F1 MCP servers exist for a single racing series — more than tennis, golf, rugby, and cricket combined. Panth1823/formula1-mcp offers 29 tools including live telemetry, OpenF1 real-time data, and historical data back to 1950. stagsz/F1-MCP-Server adds Monte Carlo race simulation and tire degradation modeling.

**Open Wearables is the unification play.** What started as apple-health-mcp-server (915 stars) evolved into a platform supporting Apple Health, Garmin, Polar, Suunto, Whoop, and Samsung Health Connect — with a companion app that eliminates manual data exports. This is the closest thing to a universal fitness data MCP server.

**WHOOP has surprising implementation diversity.** Six servers across TypeScript, Ruby, and Go reflect the biohacker community's eagerness to integrate recovery, strain, and sleep data with AI assistants. No other single wearable device has implementations in three programming languages.

**Multi-sport data is finally comprehensive.** Balldontlie's official MCP server covers 18 leagues with 250+ endpoints spanning NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL, EPL, MMA, and esports. ESPN-based servers add real-time scores, standings, and news. Between these platforms, most major professional sports leagues are covered through a single MCP interface.

**The biggest gap: no official servers from anyone.** Not Strava, not Garmin, not Fitbit, not Peloton, not any major sports league (NFL, NBA, MLB, FIFA). Everything is community-built on public and reverse-engineered APIs. Also missing: tennis, golf, rugby, and swimming — major global sports with zero dedicated MCP servers.
