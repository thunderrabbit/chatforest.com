We've reviewed **7 categories** of Email & Notification Services MCP servers, evaluating over **100 individual servers** across transactional email APIs, SMS and telephony, push notifications, and multi-channel notification orchestration. Each review covers architecture patterns, star counts, tool inventories, known issues, and honest ratings.

The transactional email space has the highest concentration of official first-party MCP servers of any service category. Resend, MailerSend, Mailgun, Mailtrap, and Postmark have all shipped official servers — every major transactional email vendor has MCP support. The pattern is clear: email API companies see AI agents as a core delivery channel, and MCP is the integration they're standardizing on.

## Transactional Email APIs

The developer-focused email delivery platforms that power automated emails, receipts, password resets, and marketing campaigns. All five vendors in this group ship official first-party MCP servers — a 100% vendor adoption rate.

## Category Overview

**7 reviews. 100+ servers. Average rating: 3.6/5.**

### What stands out

**100% vendor adoption for transactional email.** Resend, MailerSend, Mailgun, Mailtrap, and Postmark have all shipped official first-party MCP servers. This is the only service category where every major vendor has official MCP support. The message delivery industry — already API-first — was a natural fit for MCP.

**Resend is the developer experience leader.** At 475 stars, Resend's MCP server has 3–10x the GitHub engagement of any competitor. Dual stdio+HTTP transport, 30+ tools covering the full email lifecycle (send, receive, contacts, broadcasts, domains, webhooks), and clean TypeScript code make it the reference implementation for how email MCP servers should work.

**Mailgun has the most tools, by far.** With 70 MCP tools across 11 categories, Mailgun exposes more email API surface than any competitor. The no-delete safety design is notable — the server intentionally omits destructive operations, keeping blast radius low even if an agent misbehaves.

**MailerSend pioneered cloud-hosted email MCP.** While most email servers require local installation via npx or Docker, MailerSend runs entirely in the cloud with Streamable HTTP transport and OAuth. No cloning repos, no managing processes — just a URL and an auth flow. This is likely the future of email MCP integration.

**Tool count varies wildly.** From Postmark's minimal 4 tools to Mailgun's 70, the spectrum reflects fundamentally different integration philosophies. More tools isn't always better — Postmark's focused set covers the essential email workflow, while Mailgun's exhaustive surface can overwhelm LLM context windows.

**Twilio is in a league of its own.** With ~2,000 API endpoints across 40+ services, Twilio's MCP server dwarfs every other messaging integration. The tradeoff: you must filter with `--services` and `--tags` flags because no LLM can process all endpoints at once. It's the most powerful and the most unwieldy.
