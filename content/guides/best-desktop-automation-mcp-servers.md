Desktop automation MCP servers give AI agents "eyes and hands" — the ability to see screens, click buttons, type text, and control applications through the Model Context Protocol. Instead of calling APIs, these servers let agents interact with computer interfaces the same way humans do.

We've published [in-depth reviews](/reviews/) covering 25+ desktop automation MCP servers across the entire computer use landscape. This guide synthesizes all of that into one page: what's worth using, what's not, and where the gaps are.

## Why desktop automation MCP servers matter

Desktop automation is one of the most transformative MCP categories. It fundamentally expands what AI agents can do beyond API calls:

1. **Interact with any application.** Most software doesn't have an API. Desktop automation lets agents use any application — from legacy enterprise software to modern web apps — through the same interface humans use. "Open Photoshop, resize this image to 800x600, and export as WebP" becomes possible.
2. **Automate authenticated workflows.** Instead of building OAuth flows and API integrations, agents can work with already-logged-in browser sessions and desktop applications. The authentication problem disappears when the agent uses the same session as the user.
3. **Bridge the API gap.** Even when APIs exist, they often cover only a fraction of an application's functionality. Desktop automation can reach features that APIs don't expose — admin panels, settings pages, visual editors, and internal tools.

The landscape splits into six categories: **browser automation** (the most mature, with Microsoft Playwright and Google Chrome DevTools leading), **Windows desktop control** (system-level UI interaction), **macOS automation** (AppleScript/JXA-powered scripting), **cross-platform desktop tools** (PyAutoGUI-based), **developer tools** (terminal and file management), and **enterprise RPA** (UiPath's platform-level MCP support).

## Browser Automation

Browser automation is the most mature subcategory. Two tech giants — Microsoft and Google — have released official MCP servers, and together they cover both accessibility-tree and DevTools approaches.

### The winner: microsoft/playwright-mcp

**[Full review: Desktop Automation & Browser Control MCP Servers →](/reviews/desktop-automation-rpa-mcp-servers/)** | Rating: 4.0/5

[microsoft/playwright-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) — 29,400 stars, TypeScript, official. The standard for browser automation via MCP.

**Why it wins:** Playwright MCP introduced a paradigm shift — **accessibility-tree-driven interaction** that gives LLMs structured, text-based snapshots of web pages instead of screenshots. This approach is deterministic (no pixel ambiguity), lightweight (no vision model needed), and works with any LLM, not just multimodal ones. It's the most-starred MCP server in any category.

**Key features:** Multi-browser support for Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. Session persistence with profile storage or isolated contexts. Browser extension support — connect to existing tabs with logged-in state via CDP. Code generation outputting TypeScript Playwright scripts. Console message capture and network request/response handling. Trace recording for debugging. Optional `--caps` flag enables Vision (coordinate-based interactions), PDF generation, and DevTools integration.

**2026 update:** Playwright is adding a token-efficient CLI mode with skills at playwright-cli, making it more coding agent-friendly. The server has reached 29,400 stars and 498 commits. Claude Desktop Extensions integration provides one-click installation.

**The catch:** Launches new browser instances by default — not ideal when you need to work with existing logged-in sessions (use BrowserMCP for that). The accessibility-tree approach occasionally misses dynamic content or canvas elements.

### Strong alternative: ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp (Google Official)

[ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp) — 30,700 stars, JavaScript, official Google project. Chrome's debugging and automation surface exposed to AI agents.

**Why it's notable:** This is Google's answer to Playwright MCP — but aimed at debugging and performance rather than general automation. It connects to a **live Chrome browser instance**, providing 29 tools across input automation (9), navigation (6), emulation (2), performance (4), network (2), and debugging (6).

**Key capabilities:** Performance trace recording with actionable insights. Network request analysis. Screenshot capture. Console message inspection with source-mapped stack traces. Puppeteer-based action automation with automatic wait handling. Integration with Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, and more.

**Best for:** Frontend developers who need AI-assisted debugging and performance optimization. If your workflow centers on "why is this page slow" or "what's happening in the network tab," Chrome DevTools MCP is purpose-built for that.

**The catch:** Chrome-only (no Firefox/WebKit). More debugging-focused than general-purpose automation. Uses Puppeteer under the hood rather than Playwright's accessibility-tree approach.

### Best for existing sessions: BrowserMCP/mcp

[BrowserMCP/mcp](https://github.com/BrowserMCP/mcp) — 6,100 stars, TypeScript, Apache-2.0. Automates the user's existing browser through a Chrome extension.

**Why it wins this category:** Instead of launching new browser instances, BrowserMCP automates the **user's existing browser** — preserving logged-in sessions, existing cookies, and real browser fingerprints. No credentials need to be passed to the MCP server. Basic bot detection is circumvented by using a real browser profile.

Adapted from Microsoft's Playwright MCP, this is ideal for interacting with authenticated services — dashboards, admin panels, internal tools — without re-implementing authentication flows.

**The catch:** Only 6 commits — more of an adaptation than a deeply developed project. Chrome-only. No headless or CI/CD support.

### Device emulation: executeautomation/mcp-playwright

[executeautomation/mcp-playwright](https://github.com/executeautomation/mcp-playwright) — 5,300 stars, TypeScript, MIT. **143 real device presets** — iPhone, iPad, Pixel, Galaxy, Desktop — with automatic user-agent handling, touch event emulation, and device pixel ratio simulation.

**Best for:** Responsive testing and mobile web automation. Also provides test code generation for creating reusable Playwright test scripts, web scraping capabilities, and both HTTP and stdio transport.

### Cloud browser sessions: browserbase/mcp-server-browserbase

[browserbase/mcp-server-browserbase](https://github.com/browserbase/mcp-server-browserbase) — 3,200 stars, TypeScript. Cloud-hosted browser sessions via the Browserbase platform and Stagehand.

**Why you'd choose cloud:** Anti-detection with stealth mode, proxy support, session persistence, and multi-provider LLM compatibility (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini). Performance claims 20-40% faster operations through automatic caching. No local browser setup needed — suitable for production automation pipelines and CI/CD.

**The catch:** Requires a Browserbase account and API key. Not free.

### Selenium: angiejones/mcp-selenium

[angiejones/mcp-selenium](https://github.com/angiejones/mcp-selenium) — 374 stars, JavaScript, MIT. Selenium WebDriver with Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari support.

**Best for:** Teams already invested in Selenium infrastructure. Covers the full WebDriver surface — navigation, interaction (click/doubleclick/rightclick/hover), keyboard input, screenshots, JavaScript execution, window management, iframe switching, alert handling, cookie management, file uploads, and diagnostics.

```

## Windows Desktop Automation

### The winner: CursorTouch/Windows-MCP

**[Full review: Desktop Automation & Browser Control MCP Servers →](/reviews/desktop-automation-rpa-mcp-servers/)** | Rating: 4.0/5

[CursorTouch/Windows-MCP](https://github.com/CursorTouch/Windows-MCP) — 4,800 stars, Python, MIT. The most adopted Windows desktop automation MCP server.

**Why it wins:** Comprehensive system control with **0.2-0.9 second typical latency** for real-time interaction. Two interaction modes: **Snapshot mode** for vision-based interaction and **DOM mode** (`use_dom=True`) for structured element trees — similar to Playwright's accessibility-tree approach but applied to native Windows UI.

**Key features:** Input/Control tools (Click, Type, Scroll, Move, Shortcut, Wait, MultiSelect, MultiEdit, Clipboard). System tools (Snapshot, App launch/resize/switch, Shell via PowerShell, Process list/terminate, Registry read/write/delete). Web/Data tools (Scrape, Notification via Windows toast).

**2026 updates:** Now available on PyPI (`uvx windows-mcp`). 2M+ users via Claude Desktop Extensions. Added VM support for remote Windows automation at windowsmcp.io. Companion "Windows-Use" agent on PyPI. 291 commits, 603 forks.

**The catch:** Windows-only. Unrestricted system access (registry, processes, shell) with limited safety controls. An AI agent with full desktop control could cause unintended damage in production.

### Runner-up: mario-andreschak/mcp-windows-desktop-automation

[mario-andreschak/mcp-windows-desktop-automation](https://github.com/mario-andreschak/mcp-windows-desktop-automation) — 102 stars, TypeScript, MIT. Wraps **AutoIt functions** — the venerable Windows automation toolkit.

Mouse operations, keyboard functions, window management, UI control interaction, process control, and system functions. Also provides prompt templates for common automation scenarios. Supports both stdio and WebSocket transports. Only 4 commits — more of a thin wrapper than a deeply developed project, but AutoIt's foundation provides battle-tested automation primitives.

## macOS Desktop Automation

macOS has the richest scripting ecosystem of any desktop platform, thanks to AppleScript and JavaScript for Automation (JXA).

### The winner: steipete/macos-automator-mcp

**[Full review: Desktop Automation & Browser Control MCP Servers →](/reviews/desktop-automation-rpa-mcp-servers/)** | Rating: 4.0/5

[steipete/macos-automator-mcp](https://github.com/steipete/macos-automator-mcp) — 711 stars, TypeScript. Ships with **over 200 pre-programmed automation sequences** for AppleScript and JXA.

**Why it wins:** Three core tools — `execute_script` (runs AppleScript/JXA), `get_scripting_tips` (searches 200+ recipes), and `accessibility_query` (UI element inspection via the Accessibility framework). Covers Safari, Mail, Finder, Terminal, notifications, volume control, clipboard management, dark mode toggling, and more. The knowledge base is extensible at `~/.macos-automator/knowledge_base`.

**Best for:** macOS power users who want AI agents to control system-level functions and native applications through scripting rather than pixel-based automation.

### Best for app integration: joshrutkowski/applescript-mcp

[joshrutkowski/applescript-mcp](https://github.com/joshrutkowski/applescript-mcp) — 368 stars, TypeScript. Structured tools for deep integration with macOS applications.

**Calendar**, **Clipboard**, **Finder**, **System controls** (volume, dark mode, app management), **Notifications**, **Terminal (iTerm)**, **Shortcuts** (execute Apple Shortcuts by name), **Mail** (compose, list, search), **Messages** (list conversations, send messages), **Notes** (create, list, search), **Pages** (create documents).

**Best for:** Agents that need to interact with native macOS applications (Calendar, Mail, Messages, Notes) through structured tools rather than raw script execution.

### Zero-dependency option: antbotlab/mac-use-mcp

[antbotlab/mac-use-mcp](https://github.com/antbotlab/mac-use-mcp) — 1 star, TypeScript, MIT, 18 tools. Pre-compiled Swift binary, macOS 13+ on Intel and Apple Silicon. Zero native dependencies (`npx mac-use-mcp`). Screen capture, input automation, window/application management, and Accessibility API support. Requires only Accessibility and Screen Recording permissions.

**Best for:** Quick setup when you just need basic macOS desktop control without the full scripting ecosystem.

## Cross-Platform Desktop Automation

These servers work on Windows, macOS, and Linux — valuable when you need one automation tool across multiple operating systems.

### The winner: AB498/computer-control-mcp

**[Full review: Desktop Automation & Browser Control MCP Servers →](/reviews/desktop-automation-rpa-mcp-servers/)** | Rating: 4.0/5

[AB498/computer-control-mcp](https://github.com/AB498/computer-control-mcp) — 120 stars, Python, MIT. Combines **PyAutoGUI** for input automation with **RapidOCR** and **ONNXRuntime** for on-screen text recognition.

**Why it wins:** Described as "Similar to 'computer-use' by Anthropic, with zero external dependencies." The OCR capability (`take_screenshot_with_ocr`) lets agents "read" what's on screen without a vision model. GPU-accelerated window capture on Windows. Truly cross-platform — Windows, macOS, and Linux.

**The catch:** PyAutoGUI is pixel-based, so it's less reliable than accessibility-tree approaches. No deep integration with any platform's native accessibility APIs. Only 7 commits.

### Most feature-dense: manushi4/Screenhand

[manushi4/Screenhand](https://github.com/manushi4/Screenhand) — 17 stars, TypeScript, AGPL-3.0. **88 tools** spanning vision, input, native app control, browser automation, anti-detection, smart execution, and platform playbooks.

Uses native **Accessibility APIs (macOS)** and **UI Automation (Windows)** rather than pixel-based approaches. Chrome DevTools Protocol for browser control. Performance claims ~50ms for native UI actions and ~10ms for Chrome operations. Ships 13 Claude Code skills and 5 specialized agents.

**The catch:** AGPL-3.0 license may limit commercial use. Only 17 stars despite impressive tool count, suggesting limited community validation.

### Other cross-platform servers

**hetaoBackend/mcp-pyautogui-server** (41 stars, Python, MIT) — PyAutoGUI wrapper with Docker support, cross-platform mouse/keyboard/screenshot. **hathibelagal-dev/mcp-pyautogui** — Another PyAutoGUI implementation. **lksrz/mcp-desktop-pro** (6 stars, JavaScript) — Fork of tanob/mcp-desktop-automation focusing on multi-action chaining with timing and error handling, aggressive image compression (50% scaling, WebP quality 15, max 300KB).

## Developer Tools

Desktop Commander isn't a traditional "desktop automation" server — it's closer to a developer's desktop swiss army knife that's become one of the most popular MCP servers overall.

### wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP

[wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP](https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP) — 5,700 stars, JavaScript.

**Key capabilities:** Terminal command execution with streaming output and process management. Full filesystem operations including recursive directory listing. Code editing with surgical text replacements. In-memory code execution (Python, Node.js, R) without saving files. Instant data analysis for CSV/JSON/Excel files. Native Excel, PDF, and DOCX read/write support. Process output pagination to prevent context overflow.

**2026 updates:** Remote AI control from ChatGPT, Claude web, and other services via Remote MCP. File preview UI with rendered markdown and inline images in Claude Desktop. Simplified onboarding (2 steps, 5 focused prompts). Uses system's default shell including login shells. Comprehensive audit logging with automatic rotation. Security hardening with symlink traversal prevention and command blocklists.

**Best for:** Developers who want comprehensive local machine control — terminal, files, and data — from any MCP-compatible AI assistant.

## Hardware Integration

### Elgato Stream Deck MCP (Official)

**[Elgato](https://www.elgato.com/ww/en/explorer/products/stream-deck/sd-mcp-setup/)** | **Stream Deck 7.4+** | **Released April 1, 2026**

Elgato added native MCP support to Stream Deck 7.4, making it the first major hardware peripheral to integrate with the Model Context Protocol. AI assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, and Nvidia G-Assist can now discover and trigger Stream Deck actions programmatically.

**How it works:** Users enable MCP in Stream Deck settings and create an "MCP Actions" profile containing only the actions they want exposed to AI. The MCP server bridge (requires Node.js) exposes those actions as MCP tools. Only actions explicitly placed in the MCP Actions profile are accessible — the rest of the user's profiles remain private.

**Use cases:** Natural-language macro triggering ("start my podcast setup" → launch recording software, adjust audio levels, switch lighting, post a going-live message). Workflow automation where AI agents chain multiple hardware actions. Hands-free control of streaming, lighting, and productivity setups.

**Why it matters:** This is the first consumer hardware MCP integration from a major peripheral manufacturer. Stream Deck has an installed base of millions of content creators, streamers, and productivity users. MCP support turns every Stream Deck action into an AI-triggerable tool — bridging the gap between software AI agents and physical workspace control.

**The catch:** Requires Node.js and Elgato's MCP Server bridge installation. Only works with actions in the dedicated MCP Actions profile. The use case is currently limited to triggering pre-configured actions rather than dynamically creating new ones.

## Enterprise RPA

### UiPath MCP Platform Integration

UiPath has the most comprehensive enterprise approach to MCP, integrating it directly into **UiPath Orchestrator** rather than offering a standalone server.

**Three server types:** **UiPath servers** expose UiPath artifacts (automations, processes, queues) as MCP tools. **Coded servers** (Preview) let developers build custom Python MCP servers and deploy them to Orchestrator. **Command servers** (Preview) import existing MCP servers from npm or PyPI.

**UiPath/uipath-mcp-python** (6 stars, Python, MIT, 299 commits) — The official SDK for building coded MCP servers, with CLI tools for authentication, project initialization, debugging, packaging, and publishing to Orchestrator.

**2026 updates:** MCP Servers now available in the United Arab Emirates region, reflecting continued geographic expansion. The platform approach means any existing MCP server can be brought into UiPath's enterprise framework with governance, scheduling, credential management, and audit logging.

**Why it matters for enterprise:** UiPath's 700+ pre-built connectors become accessible through MCP. AI agents can trigger RPA workflows, and RPA processes can expose their capabilities as MCP tools. This is the bridge between AI automation and traditional RPA.

**What's missing:** Automation Anywhere — UiPath's main competitor — still has no MCP presence. Microsoft Power Automate Desktop lacks MCP integration, though Power Apps MCP is now in public preview for Dataverse and agent feed scenarios.

## Platform comparison

| Feature | Playwright MCP | Chrome DevTools MCP | Windows-MCP | macOS Automator | Desktop Commander |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Stars | 29,400 | 30,700 | 4,800 | 711 | 5,700 |
| Platform | Cross-platform (browser) | Chrome only | Windows only | macOS only | Cross-platform |
| Approach | Accessibility tree | DevTools Protocol | Snapshot/DOM | AppleScript/JXA | Terminal + filesystem |
| Vision needed? | No (optional) | No | Optional | No | No |
| Native app control | No (browser only) | No (Chrome only) | Yes | Yes | Limited (terminal) |
| Safety controls | Session isolation | Browser sandbox | Limited | Permission-based | Command blocklists |
| Remote/cloud option | No (local) | No (local) | Yes (windowsmcp.io) | No | Yes (Remote MCP) |
| Transport | stdio, SSE, CDP | stdio | stdio | stdio | stdio |

## Three trends shaping this category

**1. Accessibility trees over screenshots.** Microsoft's Playwright MCP proved that structured accessibility snapshots outperform pixel-based approaches for browser automation. This pattern is spreading — Windows-MCP added DOM mode, and Screenhand uses native Accessibility APIs. Expect more servers to adopt structured element trees rather than relying on vision models.

**2. Remote and cloud desktop automation.** Windows-MCP added VM support at windowsmcp.io, Desktop Commander added Remote MCP for access from any AI service, and Browserbase provides cloud-hosted browser sessions. The trend is toward controlling remote machines, not just local desktops — critical for production automation and CI/CD.

**3. Vendor investment accelerating.** Two years ago, desktop automation MCP servers were all community projects. Now Microsoft (Playwright MCP, 29,400 stars), Google (Chrome DevTools MCP, 30,700 stars), and UiPath (platform-level integration) have official servers. This vendor commitment signals the category is here to stay and will continue to mature.

## Gaps and missing pieces

**No Linux-specific desktop MCP server** — despite xdotool (X11) and ydotool (Wayland/X11) being well-established automation tools, no MCP server wraps them. Linux desktop automation relies on cross-platform tools like PyAutoGUI.

**Limited safety controls** — most desktop automation servers offer unrestricted access to mouse, keyboard, and system commands. Only a few (Desktop Commander's command blocklists, UiPath's governance) provide permission boundaries. This is a significant concern for production deployments.

**No Automation Anywhere MCP server** — UiPath has native support, but its main competitor has no MCP presence.

**No Power Automate Desktop MCP** — Microsoft's own RPA platform lacks MCP integration. Power Apps MCP is in public preview, but desktop automation via Power Automate remains disconnected.

**No cross-platform desktop abstraction** — each platform has separate servers with different tool sets. No MCP server provides a unified API for "click this button" that works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

**No remote desktop protocol support** — all desktop MCP servers assume local execution or proprietary cloud hosting. No MCP server targets VNC, RDP, or cloud desktops generically.

**Fragmented browser automation** — Playwright, Chrome DevTools, Selenium, Puppeteer, BrowserMCP, and Browserbase all solve overlapping problems with different trade-offs. Choosing requires understanding accessibility trees vs. DevTools Protocol vs. existing sessions vs. cloud vs. Selenium legacy.

## Bottom line

Desktop automation is one of the most transformative MCP categories, fundamentally expanding what AI agents can do beyond API calls. **For browser automation, start with Playwright MCP** — its accessibility-tree approach is the gold standard, and at 29,400 stars it has massive community support. Use Chrome DevTools MCP for debugging, BrowserMCP for authenticated sessions, Browserbase for cloud automation. **For Windows, Windows-MCP is the clear leader** with 4,800 stars and sub-second latency. **For macOS, steipete/macos-automator-mcp** provides the richest scripting ecosystem with 200+ recipes. **For developer workflows, Desktop Commander** (5,700 stars) gives comprehensive terminal, file, and data capabilities.

The biggest gap is safety: most servers provide unrestricted system access, and the category badly needs standardized permission models. The biggest opportunity is cross-platform abstraction — one server that works reliably on Windows, macOS, and Linux with native accessibility APIs, not just PyAutoGUI pixel detection.
