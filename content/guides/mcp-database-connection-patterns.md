Databases hold the data AI agents need most — customer records, product catalogs, analytics, internal knowledge. The Model Context Protocol gives agents a standard way to query and (sometimes) write to those databases. But getting the connection right means navigating real tradeoffs: how much schema to expose, how to prevent SQL injection, whether to allow writes, and how to scale beyond a single user.

This guide covers the patterns for connecting AI agents to databases through MCP, from simple local setups to production multi-tenant deployments. Our analysis draws on published documentation, vendor implementations, and security research — we research and analyze rather than deploying these systems ourselves.

## Why MCP for Database Access?

Before MCP, connecting an AI agent to a database typically meant one of three things:

1. **Hardcoded SQL in prompts** — fragile, no schema awareness, security nightmare
2. **Custom API wrappers** — works but requires building and maintaining REST endpoints for every query pattern
3. **Function calling with raw connection strings** — the agent gets a database connection and runs arbitrary SQL

MCP improves on all three by providing:

- **Discoverable schema** — agents can inspect available tables, columns, and relationships before querying
- **Typed tool interfaces** — queries go through defined tools with parameter validation
- **Consistent protocol** — the same connection pattern works across Claude, GPT, Gemini, and other MCP-compatible clients
- **Resource exposure** — table schemas, documentation, and metadata can be exposed as MCP resources the agent reads before deciding what to query

The result: agents that understand your database structure and query it through controlled interfaces, rather than guessing at SQL and hoping for the best.

## Choosing a Database MCP Server

The landscape of database MCP servers has shifted significantly. Anthropic's original PostgreSQL and SQLite servers are archived — the PostgreSQL server has a [known SQL injection vulnerability](https://securitylabs.datadoghq.com/articles/mcp-vulnerability-case-study-SQL-injection-in-the-postgresql-mcp-server/) that bypasses its read-only protection. Community and vendor alternatives are now the right choice.

### Decision Criteria

**Use Google MCP Toolbox when** you need production-grade features out of the box — connection pooling, OAuth 2.1 with OIDC, authenticated parameters that bind tool inputs to user identity tokens, and OpenTelemetry observability. It supports the widest range of databases and is designed for multi-user deployments.

**Use Postgres MCP Pro when** you're self-hosting PostgreSQL and want configurable read/write access with built-in performance analysis (index suggestions, query optimization). It replaces the archived official server with actual security.

**Use DBHub when** you have multiple database types and want a single MCP server that connects to all of them through a universal JDBC layer.

**Use the Docker MCP Database Server when** you want to get started in minutes without installing anything beyond Docker.

## Schema Exposure: What Your Agent Should See

The most consequential decision in database MCP setup isn't which server to use — it's how much of your schema to expose. Expose too little and the agent can't write useful queries. Expose too much and you leak internal structure, waste context tokens, and create security risks.

### The Schema Exposure Spectrum

```
Full schema dump ←——————————————→ Curated tool interface
(every table,        (pre-defined
 column, index)       query templates)
```

Most production deployments land somewhere in the middle. Here's what works:

### Strategy 1: Allow-Listed Tables

Expose only the tables the agent needs. If your database has 200 tables but the agent only needs `customers`, `orders`, and `products`, only those three should appear in the schema.

```yaml
# Google MCP Toolbox configuration example
sources:
  my-pg:
    kind: postgres
    host: db.example.com
    port: 5432
    database: app_db
    user: mcp_readonly

tools:
  search_customers:
    source: my-pg
    description: "Search customers by name or email"
    statement: "SELECT id, name, email, created_at FROM customers WHERE name ILIKE $1 OR email ILIKE $1"
    parameters:
      - name: search_term
        type: string
        description: "Name or email to search for (supports partial matching)"

  get_order_details:
    source: my-pg
    description: "Get order details including line items"
    statement: >
      SELECT o.id, o.status, o.total, o.created_at,
             json_agg(json_build_object('product', p.name, 'qty', li.quantity, 'price', li.price))
      FROM orders o
      JOIN line_items li ON li.order_id = o.id
      JOIN products p ON p.id = li.product_id
      WHERE o.id = $1
      GROUP BY o.id
    parameters:
      - name: order_id
        type: integer
        description: "The order ID to look up"
```

This approach means the agent never sees tables like `admin_users`, `api_keys`, or `payment_tokens`.

### Strategy 2: Column Filtering

Even within allowed tables, some columns shouldn't be visible. Filter out:

- **Sensitive PII**: social security numbers, full addresses, payment details
- **Internal metadata**: soft-delete flags, internal audit columns, legacy migration fields
- **Large blobs**: binary data, serialized objects, base64-encoded files (these waste context tokens)

### Strategy 3: Views as the MCP Interface

Create database views specifically for MCP access. Views let you:

- Join related tables into agent-friendly shapes
- Exclude sensitive columns at the database level
- Rename cryptic column names (`usr_acct_lvl` → `account_level`)
- Pre-filter data (e.g., only active records)

```sql
-- View designed for MCP agent access
CREATE VIEW mcp_customer_summary AS
SELECT
  c.id,
  c.display_name,
  c.email,
  c.account_level,
  c.created_at,
  COUNT(o.id) as total_orders,
  SUM(o.total) as lifetime_value
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON o.customer_id = c.id
WHERE c.deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY c.id;
```

The MCP server then exposes this view instead of the raw tables.

### Strategy 4: Pre-Defined Query Templates

The most restrictive approach: don't let the agent write SQL at all. Define specific query templates with parameterized inputs. Google's MCP Toolbox uses this pattern — each tool is a named SQL statement with typed parameters.

This eliminates SQL injection entirely (the agent never constructs SQL) but limits flexibility. The agent can only run queries you've anticipated.

### Which Strategy to Choose

| Scenario | Strategy | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Internal analytics dashboard | Allow-listed tables | Analysts need flexible queries across known tables |
| Customer-facing chatbot | Pre-defined templates | Zero tolerance for SQL injection or data leakage |
| Developer productivity tool | Views + column filtering | Developers need flexibility but shouldn't see prod secrets |
| Multi-tenant SaaS | Templates with authenticated params | Tenant isolation must be enforced in every query |

## Query Security: Preventing SQL Injection

The Datadog security research on Anthropic's archived PostgreSQL MCP server revealed a critical pattern: the server used `SET transaction_read_only = true` to enforce read-only access, but an attacker could inject `COMMIT;` in a query string to end the read-only transaction and execute arbitrary write operations.

This isn't a theoretical risk — it's how MCP database servers fail in practice. Here's how to prevent it.

### Parameterized Queries (Non-Negotiable)

Never concatenate user input (or AI-generated input) into SQL strings. Use parameterized queries for every database interaction:

```python
# DANGEROUS — SQL injection possible
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '{user_input}'"

# SAFE — parameterized query
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = $1"
params = [user_input]
```

This applies even when the MCP server constructs queries internally. AI-generated tool arguments are user input — they can contain injected SQL, either from prompt injection attacks or from the model hallucinating query fragments.

### Database-Level Enforcement

Don't rely solely on application-level controls. Enforce access at the database level:

```sql
-- Create a dedicated MCP user with minimal privileges
CREATE ROLE mcp_agent LOGIN PASSWORD 'secure_password';

-- Grant read-only access to specific tables only
GRANT SELECT ON customers, orders, products TO mcp_agent;

-- Explicitly deny access to sensitive tables
REVOKE ALL ON admin_users, api_keys, payment_tokens FROM mcp_agent;

-- For PostgreSQL: enable row-level security
ALTER TABLE customers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON customers
  USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::int);
```

If the MCP server is compromised or the AI generates malicious queries, database-level permissions are the last line of defense.

### Query Validation Layer

Add a validation layer between the MCP tool handler and the database:

1. **Statement type checking** — reject anything that's not a SELECT (if read-only is the intent)
2. **Table allow-listing** — reject queries referencing tables outside the allowed set
3. **Result size limits** — cap the number of rows returned to prevent context window exhaustion
4. **Query timeout** — kill queries that run longer than a threshold (e.g., 5 seconds)

Oracle's MCP Server implements this pattern by logging all interactions to a `DBTOOLS$MCP_LOG` audit table, providing a full trail of what the agent queried and received.

## Read-Only vs Read-Write: When to Allow Writes

Most database MCP setups should start read-only. Writes introduce significantly more risk:

- **Data corruption** from malformed AI-generated INSERT/UPDATE statements
- **Cascading effects** from triggers, foreign key constraints, and business logic
- **Irreversibility** — a bad SELECT wastes time; a bad DELETE loses data

### When Read-Only Is Sufficient

- Analytics and reporting ("show me last month's revenue by region")
- Customer support lookups ("find order #12345")
- Schema exploration and documentation
- Data quality audits ("which records are missing email addresses")

### When Writes Make Sense

- Workflow automation ("mark this ticket as resolved")
- Data entry assistance ("add this new customer record")
- Bulk updates with human approval ("update all prices by 10% — confirm before executing")

### Safe Write Patterns

If you allow writes, implement guardrails:

**Approval workflows**: The agent prepares the SQL statement but doesn't execute it. A human reviews and approves. MCP's [elicitation feature](/guides/mcp-elicitation-explained/) can facilitate this — the server requests confirmation before executing destructive operations.

**Write-through staging**: Writes go to a staging table first. A separate process (or human review) promotes them to production tables.

**Audit logging**: Every write operation is logged with the full query, parameters, executing user, timestamp, and result. This is non-negotiable for any write-enabled MCP database server.

**Scope limiting**: Even with write access, limit which operations are allowed. An agent that can INSERT new support tickets shouldn't be able to DROP TABLE.

## Connection Pooling and Performance

A local MCP server handling one user's queries doesn't need connection pooling. A remote MCP server handling requests from 50 concurrent AI agent sessions does.

### The Connection Exhaustion Problem

Each MCP session that opens its own database connection can quickly exhaust the database's connection limit. PostgreSQL defaults to 100 max connections. If each AI agent session holds a connection, you hit the limit fast.

### Pooling Strategies

**Application-level pooling**: The MCP server maintains a pool of database connections and assigns them to incoming requests. Google's MCP Toolbox handles this automatically.

**External connection poolers**: Tools like PgBouncer (PostgreSQL) or ProxySQL (MySQL) sit between the MCP server and the database, managing connection reuse:

```
AI Agents → MCP Server → PgBouncer → PostgreSQL
              (50 sessions)  (10 connections)  (10 active)
```

This means 50 concurrent agent sessions share 10 database connections, with PgBouncer handling the multiplexing.

**Serverless database connections**: Neon and PlanetScale offer connection multiplexing at the database level, eliminating the need for external poolers.

### Session Management

MCP connections follow a lifecycle: initialization, active use, idle period, termination. For database-backed MCP servers:

- **Set idle timeouts** — release database connections after 5 minutes of inactivity
- **Limit query duration** — kill queries exceeding a timeout (prevents runaway analytical queries from holding connections)
- **Track session-to-connection mapping** — know which agent session is using which database connection for debugging

### Result Set Optimization

AI agents don't need the same result formats as application code. Optimize for token efficiency:

- **Limit row counts** — return at most 50-100 rows per query; offer pagination for more
- **Select specific columns** — avoid `SELECT *`; return only the columns the agent asked about
- **Summarize large results** — for analytics queries, return aggregates rather than raw rows
- **Format for readability** — return results as formatted tables or JSON, not raw tuples

## Multi-Tenant Database Access

When multiple users access the same database through the same MCP server, tenant isolation becomes critical. Without it, one user's agent could query another user's data.

### Row-Level Security (RLS)

The strongest isolation pattern uses database-native row-level security:

```sql
-- PostgreSQL RLS example
ALTER TABLE orders ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Each tenant only sees their own orders
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON orders
  FOR ALL
  USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::int);
```

The MCP server sets `app.current_tenant` at the start of each session based on the authenticated user's identity. Even if the agent generates a query without a `WHERE tenant_id = ?` clause, RLS silently filters the results.

### Authenticated Parameters (Google MCP Toolbox)

Google's MCP Toolbox introduces "authenticated parameters" — tool inputs that are automatically bound to values from the user's OIDC token rather than agent-supplied values:

```yaml
tools:
  get_my_orders:
    source: my-pg
    description: "Get the current user's orders"
    statement: "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = $1"
    parameters:
      - name: user_id
        type: string
        authSources:
          - kind: oidc
            claim: sub  # Bound to the user's identity token
```

The agent can't override `user_id` — it's always extracted from the authenticated session. This prevents both accidental and malicious cross-tenant data access.

### Separate Database Users Per Tenant

For the strongest isolation, each tenant gets their own database user with permissions scoped to their data. This is more operationally complex but provides defense-in-depth:

```
Tenant A agent → MCP Server → tenant_a_user → PostgreSQL (schema: tenant_a)
Tenant B agent → MCP Server → tenant_b_user → PostgreSQL (schema: tenant_b)
```

### Schema-Per-Tenant

An alternative to RLS: each tenant's data lives in a separate database schema. The MCP server sets `search_path` based on the authenticated tenant:

```sql
SET search_path TO tenant_12345, shared;
```

This provides physical separation without separate databases, and makes tenant data deletion straightforward (drop the schema).

## Local vs Remote: Deployment Patterns

### Local Database MCP (Development and Personal Use)

The simplest pattern: the MCP server and database run on the same machine.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-db": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sqlite", "~/my-data.db"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Advantages**: No network latency, no authentication complexity, no connection pooling needed. The agent inherits your filesystem permissions.

**When to use**: Personal data analysis, local development databases, prototyping.

**Security note**: Even locally, avoid connecting to databases containing production data or credentials for other systems.

### Remote Database MCP (Team and Production Use)

The MCP server runs as a remote service, connecting to a database over the network:

```
AI Client → (Streamable HTTP) → MCP Server → (TCP/TLS) → Database
```

**Requirements**:
- OAuth 2.1 or API key authentication for the MCP connection
- TLS encryption for both the client-to-MCP and MCP-to-database connections
- Connection pooling (discussed above)
- Rate limiting to prevent query flooding
- Audit logging for compliance

**When to use**: Team environments, production data access, multi-user deployments.

### Hybrid: Local MCP Server, Remote Database

A middle ground: the MCP server runs locally (stdio transport) but connects to a remote database. This avoids the complexity of hosting and authenticating the MCP server while still accessing shared data.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prod-db": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "my_db_mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://readonly:****@db.example.com:5432/app"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Security note**: The database credentials are stored locally, so this pattern requires secure credential management. See our [MCP Credential & Secret Management](/guides/mcp-credential-secret-management/) guide for best practices.

## Production Checklist

Before connecting AI agents to a production database through MCP:

### Security
- [ ] Database user has minimal required privileges (least privilege)
- [ ] Read-only access unless writes are explicitly needed and controlled
- [ ] Parameterized queries for all database interactions
- [ ] Sensitive tables and columns excluded from schema exposure
- [ ] Row-level security or equivalent tenant isolation (if multi-tenant)
- [ ] TLS encryption for all database connections
- [ ] Credentials stored in a secrets manager, not config files

### Performance
- [ ] Connection pooling configured for expected concurrent sessions
- [ ] Query timeouts set (recommend 5-10 seconds for interactive queries)
- [ ] Result row limits enforced (50-100 rows default, with pagination)
- [ ] Database connection limits account for MCP server pool size
- [ ] Indexes exist for common agent query patterns

### Observability
- [ ] All queries logged with session ID, user identity, and timestamp
- [ ] Query duration metrics collected
- [ ] Error rates monitored and alerted
- [ ] Connection pool utilization tracked
- [ ] Slow query detection enabled

### Operations
- [ ] Database failover tested with MCP server connected
- [ ] Credential rotation procedure documented and tested
- [ ] Schema change process accounts for MCP tool definitions
- [ ] Backup and recovery tested independently of MCP layer

## Common Mistakes

**Exposing the full schema**: Dumping every table and column into the MCP schema wastes context tokens and leaks internal structure. Curate what the agent sees.

**Trusting application-level read-only**: The Datadog research showed that `SET transaction_read_only = true` can be bypassed with SQL injection. Always enforce access at the database user level.

**No result size limits**: An agent running `SELECT * FROM logs` against a table with 10 million rows will exhaust context tokens and possibly the database connection. Cap results.

**Sharing database credentials across environments**: The MCP server connecting to staging and production should use different credentials with different permission levels.

**Ignoring schema changes**: When you add or rename database columns, your MCP tool definitions may break silently. Include MCP tool validation in your schema migration process.

**No query audit trail**: Without logging, you can't debug agent behavior, investigate data issues, or meet compliance requirements. Log every query.

## What's Next

Database MCP access is maturing rapidly. Google's MCP Toolbox set a high bar for production features (connection pooling, OAuth, OpenTelemetry), and other implementations are catching up. The [2026 MCP roadmap](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/blog/roadmap-2026) prioritizes enterprise readiness — expect standardized audit logging, improved configuration portability, and better tooling for schema management.
