Memory is the hardest problem in agentic AI. An agent that forgets everything between sessions is an expensive autocomplete. An agent that remembers everything drowns in irrelevant context. The MCP ecosystem now has dozens of memory servers trying to find the sweet spot — and they take radically different approaches.

We [reviewed the official Memory MCP server](/reviews/memory-mcp-server/) and gave it 3.5/5: the right idea, not yet the right tool for serious use. But it's far from the only option. Here's how the major memory servers compare, and which one you should actually use.

## The Contenders

## The Landscape in 60 Seconds

Memory MCP servers split along three axes:

**Local vs. cloud.** The official server, Basic Memory, Chroma, and Engram store everything on your machine. Zep and mem0 route through cloud APIs. This matters for privacy, latency, and cost.

**Search type.** Text matching (official server) finds exact strings. Semantic/vector search (mem0, Chroma) finds conceptually similar content. Graph-based search (Zep) traverses relationships. Hybrid approaches (Basic Memory) combine multiple methods. The right choice depends on how your agent retrieves memory — targeted lookups vs. fuzzy recall.

**General-purpose vs. specialized.** Most servers try to be universal memory layers. Engram is purpose-built for coding agents. Zep is built for enterprise conversations. Basic Memory is built for humans who want to read and edit their agent's memory directly.

## The Official Server: Simple but Fragile

The [official Memory MCP server](/reviews/memory-mcp-server/) (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory`) stores a knowledge graph as entities, relations, and observations in a JSONL file. It's the reference implementation, pulling ~45,000 weekly npm downloads.

**What works:** The entity-relation model is intuitive. Setup takes 30 seconds. It's actively maintained (unlike the archived SQLite and PostgreSQL servers). For remembering a few dozen facts about a single user, it's fine.

**What breaks:** `read_graph` dumps your entire knowledge graph into the context window. Community reports show 14,000+ tokens for modest graphs. There's no memory isolation between projects, no deduplication, no semantic search, and no temporal awareness. Facts don't expire or conflict-resolve — they just accumulate.

If you're a solo developer who wants their Claude Desktop to remember your name and your preferred programming language, the official server works. For anything beyond that, keep reading.

## For Enterprise: Zep/Graphiti

**[Zep/Graphiti](/reviews/zep-graphiti-mcp-server/)** (4/5) — (24,100 stars, Apache 2.0) is the most architecturally sophisticated option. Graphiti is Zep's open-source temporal knowledge graph framework, now the centerpiece of their strategy. It builds temporal knowledge graphs — facts have validity windows, so the system knows when information changed, not just what it is now.

The Graphiti MCP server (v1.0, March 2026) exposes nine tools: `add_episode` (text/JSON/message input with automatic entity extraction), `search_nodes` (entity summaries), `search_facts` (edges between entities with temporal context), `get_episodes`, `delete_episode`, `get_entity_edge`, `delete_entity_edge`, `clear_graph`, and `get_status`. Unlike the old Zep Cloud MCP which was read-only, Graphiti's MCP server supports both reads and writes.

**Strengths:**
- Temporal awareness is unique — "Alice worked at Acme until 2025" is fundamentally different from "Alice works at Acme," and Graphiti tracks both with validity windows
- Multi-database: FalkorDB (default, Redis-based), Neo4j, Kuzu, Amazon Neptune
- Multi-LLM provider: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Groq, Azure OpenAI — avoids hard vendor lock-in
- Fully open source (Apache 2.0) — runs entirely locally, no cloud dependency required
- Nine preconfigured entity types (Preference, Requirement, Procedure, Location, Event, Organization, Document, Topic, Object) optimized for extraction accuracy
- Graph quality engineering: entropy-gated fuzzy matching, MinHash + LSH deduplication, LRU caching

**Weaknesses:**
- Heavy infrastructure: Docker + graph database + LLM API key minimum
- LLM extraction costs add up at scale — every episode triggers multiple LLM calls
- 200 open issues including hallucination in extraction (#760) and model compatibility problems
- "Experimental" status despite the 1.0 label
- No hosted/remote server — self-hosted only (Zep Cloud is a separate product with separate pricing: free 1,000 episodes/month, $25-$475/month)

**Best for:** Teams building conversational agents that need to track evolving user context over time. If you're building a customer support agent that needs to know a user changed their plan last Tuesday, Graphiti is the right tool. If you're building a personal coding assistant, it's massive overkill.

## For Semantic Retrieval: mem0

**[mem0](/reviews/mem0-mcp-server/)** (4/5) — (50,700 stars on the main repo, 640 on the MCP server) takes the vector search approach. The core library reached v1.0.7 (March 20, 2026) with Ollama/LM Studio embedder support, per-agent memory isolation for multi-agent setups, and MiniMax LLM provider integration. Instead of graph traversal, it embeds memories and retrieves them by semantic similarity. Think "find memories related to this topic" rather than "traverse the graph from this entity."

Nine MCP tools cover the full CRUD cycle: `add_memory`, `search_memories`, `get_memories`, `update_memory`, `delete_memory`, plus entity management. Memories can be scoped to users, agents, apps, or individual runs — a feature the official server lacks entirely.

mem0 claims +26% accuracy over OpenAI Memory, 91% faster responses, and 90% lower token usage compared to full-context approaches.

**Strengths:**
- Semantic search finds conceptually related memories, not just exact text matches
- Multi-scope memory (user/agent/app/run) provides natural isolation
- Optional graph memory support for relationship tracking
- Apache 2.0 license for self-hosted deployments
- Large community and active development (50.7K stars)
- Per-agent memory isolation for multi-agent setups (v1.0.6+)
- Growing LLM/embedder support: Ollama, LM Studio, MiniMax (v1.0.7)

**Weaknesses:**
- Requires API key from the mem0 platform, even for self-hosted MCP server
- Responses are raw JSON strings (less polished than some alternatives)
- Hosted pricing not transparently documented
- Self-hosted setup requires embedding model configuration

**Best for:** Agents that need to recall context by topic rather than by explicit entity names. If your agent should "remember what the user said about authentication" without the user tagging it as an entity, mem0's semantic approach handles that naturally.

## For Human-Readable Memory: Basic Memory

**[Basic Memory](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory)** (2,700 stars) takes the most distinctive approach: all memory is stored as Markdown files that humans can read and edit directly. Your agent's memory isn't a black-box database — it's a folder of notes you can open in any text editor.

With 15+ tools spanning notes, knowledge graphs, search, and project management, it's the most full-featured option. The hybrid search combines full-text search with vector similarity via local embeddings (FastEmbed), so you get both exact matches and fuzzy recall without a cloud dependency. The v0.20.x series (March 2026) added auto-update functionality, section-level insert operations, and config cache improvements.

**Strengths:**
- Local-first: everything on your machine, no cloud account needed
- Bi-directional editing: both you and your agent read/write the same files
- Human-readable Markdown format — audit your agent's memory in VS Code
- Hybrid search (full-text + vector) without cloud dependencies
- Knowledge graph with entities, observations, and relations
- Project-based isolation (multiple memory projects)
- Schema system for structured validation

**Weaknesses:**
- Local-only by default (cloud sync is a paid add-on)
- Requires local embeddings via FastEmbed (adds setup overhead and disk space)
- Scalability depends on local storage and embedding model capacity
- More complex setup than the official server

**Best for:** Developers who want full control over their agent's memory and want to be able to read, edit, and version-control it. If the idea of your agent's knowledge living in a `~/memory/` folder of Markdown files appeals to you, Basic Memory is the one.

## For Custom Embedding Workflows: Chroma

**[Chroma MCP](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma-mcp)** (515 stars) exposes Chroma's embedding database as MCP tools. Development has slowed — the last release (v0.2.6) was August 2025. It's the lowest-level option: you're managing collections and documents directly, not working with a memory abstraction.

Twelve tools cover collection management (`create`, `list`, `modify`, `delete`) and document operations (`add`, `query`, `get`, `update`, `delete`). You can choose from multiple embedding functions (Default, Cohere, OpenAI, Jina, VoyageAI, Roboflow) and tune HNSW parameters per collection.

**Strengths:**
- Maximum flexibility — choose your embedding model, tune your index parameters
- Multiple deployment modes: ephemeral, persistent file, HTTP server, cloud
- Metadata filtering + full-text search alongside vector queries
- Well-documented Python/JS client ecosystem

**Weaknesses:**
- Low-level: you manage collections and documents yourself (no "memory" abstraction)
- External embedding functions require their own API keys
- More of a building block than a ready-to-use memory system
- Smaller MCP-specific community (515 stars)
- Development appears dormant (last release August 2025)

**Best for:** Teams that already use Chroma or need fine-grained control over embedding and retrieval. If you want to build a custom memory system on top of a vector database rather than use someone else's abstraction, Chroma gives you the primitives.

## For Coding Agents: Engram

**[Engram](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/engram)** (1,700 stars, +31% since early March) is the specialist pick and the fastest-growing server in this category. It's a single Go binary, zero external dependencies, built specifically for AI coding agents that need session continuity.

Thirteen tools include `mem_save`, `mem_search`, `mem_context`, `mem_timeline`, and `mem_session_summary`. Storage is SQLite with FTS5 full-text search — fast, local, and robust. The design philosophy is "progressive disclosure": search returns summaries, timeline shows evolution, and full content is available when needed. The v1.10.x series (March 2026) added automatic project name detection from git remotes (fixing monorepo/worktree name mismatches), Claude plugin marketplace support, and Windows/Linux compatibility improvements.

**Strengths:**
- Zero-dependency single binary (`brew install` or download)
- Purpose-built for coding workflows with session continuity
- Progressive disclosure prevents context bloat (a problem the official server has)
- Topic key workflow to evolve topics without duplication
- Works with Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and more
- Claude plugin marketplace support (install directly from `claude plugin marketplace add`)
- Git-based memory sync across machines
- Extremely fast setup — 42 releases showing rapid iteration

**Weaknesses:**
- FTS5 only — no semantic/vector search
- Coding-focused design may not suit general-purpose memory needs
- Community growing fast (1.7K stars) but still smaller than mem0 or Basic Memory
- No graph-based relationship tracking

**Best for:** Developers using AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) who want persistent session memory without cloud dependencies or complex setup. If you primarily need your agent to remember what you were working on across coding sessions, Engram is purpose-built for that.

## Which One Should You Use?

**Start here:** What's your primary constraint?

**"I just want my Claude Desktop to remember me"** → Use the [official Memory server](/reviews/memory-mcp-server/). It's free, takes 30 seconds to set up, and handles simple personal context fine. You'll outgrow it, but it's the right starting point.

**"I need agents that track evolving user context over time"** → Use **[Zep/Graphiti](/reviews/zep-graphiti-mcp-server/)** (4/5). Temporal knowledge graphs are unique to Graphiti, and if your use case involves facts that change (customer plans, project status, team membership), nothing else handles that natively. The open-source version (Apache 2.0) is fully self-hosted and free — you need Docker + a graph database + an LLM API key. Zep Cloud is the managed alternative if you want zero-ops ($25-$475/month).

**"I want smart memory retrieval without managing a graph"** → Use **mem0**. Semantic search finds related memories without you having to build explicit entity relationships. The multi-scope system (user/agent/app) provides natural isolation. Start with the free tier.

**"I want to read and edit my agent's memory myself"** → Use **Basic Memory**. Markdown files in a local folder. Version-control them with git. Edit them in your editor. No other server gives you this level of transparency and control.

**"I need a building block, not a product"** → Use **Chroma**. If you're building a custom memory system and want full control over embeddings, indexing, and retrieval, Chroma gives you the vector database primitives without imposing a memory abstraction.

**"I just need my coding agent to remember across sessions"** → Use **Engram**. Single binary, zero dependencies, built for exactly this use case. Progressive disclosure prevents the context bloat that plagues the official server.

## The Bottom Line

The memory MCP space has matured past the "one knowledge graph file" era. The official server is a starting point, not a destination. The right choice depends on whether you need temporal awareness ([Zep/Graphiti](/reviews/zep-graphiti-mcp-server/)), semantic retrieval ([mem0](/reviews/mem0-mcp-server/)), human-readable storage (Basic Memory), embedding control (Chroma), or coding-specific session memory (Engram).

The trend is clear: memory is moving from simple key-value stores toward context-aware retrieval systems that understand not just what was stored, but when it was relevant and how it connects to everything else. Pick the server that matches where your use case sits on that spectrum.
