AI agents that can query databases and call APIs are useful. AI agents that can move a robot arm, navigate a warehouse, or fly a drone are transformative. The Model Context Protocol is making this possible by providing a standardized interface between language models and robot systems — most notably through the Robot Operating System (ROS).

The idea is straightforward: expose a robot's capabilities — its sensors, actuators, navigation stack, manipulation pipeline — as MCP tools that any AI agent can discover and invoke through natural language. Instead of writing custom ROS nodes or learning robot-specific APIs, an operator says "pick up the red object on the table" and the AI agent translates that into the correct sequence of MCP tool calls to perception, planning, and control systems.

This is happening now. The [ros-mcp-server](https://github.com/robotmcp/ros-mcp-server) project (1.1K GitHub stars, 161 forks, 17 contributors) bridges any ROS1 or ROS2 robot to MCP-compatible AI models — Claude, GPT, Gemini — without modifying the robot's existing code. [Phosphobot](https://docs.phospho.ai/examples/mcp-for-robotics) connects language models to physical robot arms for manipulation. And the broader ecosystem now includes 50+ robotics MCP servers across 11 subcategories.

This guide covers the architecture, tools, safety considerations, and emerging patterns for MCP-robotics integration. Our analysis draws on open-source implementations, published research, ROS community discussions, and vendor documentation — we research and analyze rather than deploying these systems ourselves.

## Why MCP for Robotics?

Robot development has a persistent integration problem. Building an AI-powered robot today means connecting multiple systems: a perception stack, a planning system, motor controllers, sensor drivers, simulation environments, and increasingly, a language model for high-level reasoning. Each connection is custom code.

MCP standardizes the interface layer. A robot's capabilities become discoverable tools with typed schemas, and any MCP-compatible AI client — Claude Desktop, Cursor, a custom application — can use them.

**Unified robot access.** Whether you're controlling a Unitree Go quadruped, a 7-DOF manipulator, or a TurtleBot, the MCP interface is the same: discover tools, call them with JSON-RPC, get structured responses. The MCP server handles translation to ROS topics, services, and actions.

**Natural language control.** Operators interact through natural language instead of ROS command-line tools or custom GUIs. "Move forward 2 meters, then rotate 90 degrees left" becomes a sequence of MCP tool calls. The AI agent handles the translation from intent to robot commands.

**Rapid prototyping.** Connecting a new robot to an AI agent goes from weeks of custom integration to minutes of configuration. If the robot runs ROS, add the rosbridge node and configure the MCP server — no robot code changes required.

**Cross-model compatibility.** The same robot can be controlled by Claude, GPT, Gemini, or any MCP-compatible model. Switching AI providers doesn't require rewriting the robot integration.

## The ROS-MCP Architecture

The dominant pattern for MCP-robotics integration uses ROS (Robot Operating System) as the robot middleware and rosbridge as the communication bridge.

```

**Layer 1: AI Agent (MCP Client).** Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible application. The agent discovers available robot tools through MCP's standard tool listing mechanism and invokes them through JSON-RPC 2.0.

**Layer 2: ROS MCP Server.** Translates between MCP protocol and the rosbridge WebSocket protocol. This server exposes ROS capabilities as MCP tools with typed schemas — topic publishing, service calls, parameter management, and sensor data access.

**Layer 3: rosbridge.** The standard ROS-to-WebSocket bridge (`rosbridge_suite`). It provides a JSON interface to the entire ROS graph — topics, services, parameters, and actions. rosbridge has been battle-tested in the ROS ecosystem for years and supports both ROS1 and ROS2.

**Layer 4: Robot hardware.** The actual robot — motors, sensors, cameras, manipulators — connected through standard ROS drivers and nodes.

### Key Design Decision: rosbridge as the Bridge

The ROS MCP server communicates with ROS through rosbridge's WebSocket interface rather than directly importing ROS libraries. This is a deliberate architectural choice with significant advantages:

**Version agnosticism.** The same MCP server works with ROS1 (Noetic, Melodic) and ROS2 (Humble, Jazzy, Rolling) without code changes. rosbridge handles the version differences.

**No robot code modifications.** You add the rosbridge node to your robot's launch file. That's it. The robot's existing nodes, topics, and services become accessible through MCP automatically.

**Language independence.** The MCP server is Python. The robot code can be C++, Python, or any ROS-supported language. rosbridge's JSON protocol bridges the gap.

**Network transparency.** rosbridge operates over WebSocket, so the MCP server can run on a different machine from the robot. This enables cloud-hosted AI agents controlling local robots.

## MCP Tools for Robot Control

The ROS MCP servers in the ecosystem expose robot capabilities through several categories of tools.

### Topic Operations

ROS topics are the pub/sub backbone of robot communication. MCP servers expose them as tools:

| Tool | Description | Example Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `list_topics` | Discover all active ROS topics | Survey what a robot can do |
| `get_topic_info` | Get message type and publishers/subscribers | Understand data formats |
| `publish_message` | Send a message to a ROS topic | Send velocity commands |
| `subscribe_topic` | Read messages from a topic | Get sensor readings |

Publishing to `/cmd_vel` (velocity commands) is the most common robot control pattern. The AI agent constructs a `geometry_msgs/Twist` message with linear and angular velocity, and the MCP server publishes it:

```json
{
  "tool": "publish_message",
  "arguments": {
    "topic": "/cmd_vel",
    "message_type": "geometry_msgs/Twist",
    "message": {
      "linear": {"x": 0.5, "y": 0.0, "z": 0.0},
      "angular": {"x": 0.0, "y": 0.0, "z": 0.3}
    }
  }
}
```

### Service Operations

ROS services provide request/response interactions — set parameters, trigger behaviors, query state:

| Tool | Description | Example Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `list_services` | Discover available ROS services | Find robot capabilities |
| `call_service` | Invoke a ROS service | Trigger gripper open/close |
| `get_service_type` | Get service message type | Understand expected input format |

### Parameter Operations

ROS parameters configure runtime behavior:

| Tool | Description | Example Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `get_parameter` | Read a ROS parameter | Check max velocity limit |
| `set_parameter` | Modify a ROS parameter | Adjust navigation speed |
| `list_parameters` | List all parameters | Survey configuration |

### Action Operations (Emerging)

ROS actions handle long-running tasks with feedback — navigation goals, manipulation sequences:

| Tool | Description | Example Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `send_goal` | Start a long-running action | Navigate to coordinates |
| `cancel_goal` | Cancel an in-progress action | Stop navigation |
| `get_action_feedback` | Get progress updates | Monitor navigation progress |

Action support is the frontier of MCP-ROS integration, as it maps naturally to MCP's async Tasks specification (SEP-1686), which provides a protocol-level mechanism for long-running operations with progress notifications.

## Available ROS MCP Servers

Several implementations exist, each with different approaches:

### ros-mcp-server (robotmcp)

The most established project (1.1K stars, Apache 2.0). Supports ROS1 and ROS2 via rosbridge. Features include topic publishing/subscribing, service invocation, parameter management, and message type discovery. Demonstrated with MOCA mobile manipulators in simulation and Unitree Go quadrupeds with vision integration.

- **Architecture:** Python MCP server → rosbridge WebSocket → ROS
- **Strength:** Mature, well-documented, active community
- **Status:** Topic and service support complete, action support in development

### rosbridge-mcp-server (TakanariShimbo)

A focused implementation providing comprehensive tools for ROS interaction via rosbridge WebSocket. Emphasizes clean separation between MCP protocol handling and ROS communication.

- **Architecture:** Python, direct rosbridge WebSocket connection
- **Strength:** Clean API design, good for custom integrations
- **Tools:** Topic operations (list, info, publish), service operations (list, call), action operations (list, send goal, cancel)

### ROS 2 Bridge MCP Server (Nicolas Gres)

A ROS2-native MCP server that directly uses ROS2 client libraries rather than going through rosbridge. Lower latency but requires ROS2 installation on the MCP server machine.

- **Architecture:** Python, direct ROS2 rclpy
- **Strength:** Lower latency, no rosbridge dependency
- **Trade-off:** Requires ROS2 installation, no ROS1 support

### Roba Labs MCP Server

Provides access to NVIDIA Isaac Sim robotics simulation platform and comprehensive ROS/ROS2 framework documentation, positioned for robotics development workflows.

## Robot Manipulation Through MCP

Manipulation — picking, placing, grasping, assembling — is where MCP-robotics integration gets most interesting. AI agents can reason about objects, plan grasps, and execute multi-step manipulation sequences through tool calls.

### The Phosphobot Approach

[Phosphobot](https://docs.phospho.ai/examples/mcp-for-robotics) demonstrates a practical pattern for MCP-based manipulation. The platform connects language models to physical robot arms and exposes two core capabilities:

**Camera stream tool.** Retrieves the current frame from a webcam, providing visual context to the AI agent. The agent can see what's on the table, identify objects, and assess the scene before deciding what to do.

**Replay tool.** Triggers a pre-recorded robot action — picking up a specific object, moving to a position, performing a demonstrated task. This combines teleoperation-collected data with AI-driven task selection.

The pattern is significant because it separates *what to do* (AI reasoning) from *how to do it* (learned motor skills). The AI agent decides "pick up the red cup" based on visual understanding. The actual grasp execution uses a trained policy, not raw motor commands from the language model.

### Manipulation Architecture Patterns

Three architectures are emerging for MCP-based manipulation:

**Direct command.** The AI agent sends explicit joint positions or velocity commands through MCP tools. Simple but brittle — the AI must understand robot kinematics and dynamics.

```
AI Agent → "move_joint" tool → Joint controller → Robot arm
```

**Skill-based.** The MCP server exposes high-level skills (pick, place, pour) as tools. Each skill encapsulates the perception, planning, and control needed. The AI selects and sequences skills.

```
AI Agent → "pick_object" tool → Perception → Planning → Control → Robot arm
```

**Hybrid (SPCA).** The Sense-Plan-Code-Act pattern from recent research: the AI senses the environment through camera tools, plans a sequence of actions, generates executable code, and acts through robot tools. This maps well to MCP's tool interface where each stage is a tool call.

```
AI Agent → "get_camera_frame" → Reasoning → "execute_plan" → Control pipeline
```

### Data Collection for Learning

Phosphobot's platform supports teleoperation data collection for training robot manipulation policies. The workflow:

1. Human demonstrates tasks through teleoperation
2. Robot actions are recorded as [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) datasets
3. Policies are trained on the demonstrations
4. Trained policies are exposed as MCP tools for AI agent invocation

This creates a flywheel: human demonstrations produce policies, AI agents invoke those policies through MCP, and the results can generate additional training data.

## Navigation and Autonomous Mobility

Mobile robots — warehouse robots, delivery robots, service robots — need navigation capabilities. MCP provides the interface layer between AI planning and ROS navigation stacks.

### Navigation via MCP

The typical ROS navigation stack (Nav2 for ROS2, move_base for ROS1) exposes its capabilities through actions and services. MCP servers translate these into tool calls:

| MCP Tool | ROS Interface | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| `navigate_to_pose` | `NavigateToPose` action | Go to (x, y, θ) coordinates |
| `follow_waypoints` | `FollowWaypoints` action | Visit a sequence of points |
| `get_robot_pose` | TF2 lookup / `amcl_pose` topic | Current robot position |
| `get_costmap` | `GetCostmap` service | Obstacle map for planning |
| `cancel_navigation` | Action cancel | Stop current navigation |

### Natural Language Navigation

The power of MCP-connected navigation is natural language goal specification. Instead of coordinates, operators describe destinations:

> "Go to the loading dock, then check aisle 3 for the pallet near the south wall."

The AI agent:
1. Translates "loading dock" to map coordinates (using a semantic map or location database)
2. Sends a `navigate_to_pose` tool call
3. Monitors progress through feedback
4. On arrival, translates "aisle 3, near the south wall" to the next goal
5. Continues the sequence

This requires the AI agent to maintain a semantic understanding of the environment — either through a pre-built location database exposed as an MCP resource, or through perception-based localization using camera tools.

### Logistics and Warehouse Example

A logistics robot fulfilling orders demonstrates the full pattern:

1. **Order intake:** AI agent receives "fulfill order #5829" (via MCP tool connected to order management system)
2. **Inventory lookup:** Agent queries inventory database (MCP tool) for item locations
3. **Route planning:** Agent plans an efficient pickup route through the warehouse
4. **Navigation:** Agent sends `navigate_to_pose` commands to move between pickup locations
5. **Perception:** Agent uses camera tools to verify items at each location
6. **Manipulation:** Agent triggers pick-and-place skills for each item
7. **Delivery:** Agent navigates to the packing station

Each step is an MCP tool call. The AI agent orchestrates the workflow, making decisions about routing, handling exceptions (item not found, path blocked), and coordinating with other robots through shared state.

## Simulation Environments

Testing AI-controlled robots in the physical world is expensive and dangerous. Simulation provides a safe, fast development environment, and MCP bridges AI agents to simulators just as easily as to physical robots.

### Gazebo

[Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/) is the standard open-source robot simulator in the ROS ecosystem. Current LTS releases:
- **Gazebo Harmonic** — supported until September 2028
- **Gazebo Jetty** — supported until September 2030

Because Gazebo integrates directly with ROS, it works with ROS MCP servers out of the box. The AI agent doesn't know (or care) whether it's controlling a simulated or real robot — the MCP tool interface is identical.

This enables a powerful development workflow:
1. Develop and test AI-robot interactions in Gazebo simulation
2. Validate safety constraints and edge cases
3. Transfer to physical hardware with no MCP-side changes

### NVIDIA Isaac Sim

[NVIDIA Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim) provides GPU-accelerated physics simulation with photorealistic rendering. Released as open-source (Isaac Sim 5.0), it offers:

- PhysX GPU-accelerated physics
- RTX ray-traced rendering for realistic camera simulation
- Comprehensive ROS2 integration
- Domain randomization for robust policy training
- Synthetic data generation for perception training

The [Roba Labs MCP Server](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/@Tairon-ai/roba-labs-mcp) provides access to Isaac Sim for robotics development, and ros-mcp-server has demonstrated Isaac Sim integration for testing.

### Sim-to-Real Transfer

The simulation-to-reality gap is a fundamental challenge in robotics. MCP helps by providing a consistent interface layer:

```
                    ┌─── Gazebo ────────── ROS ───┐
AI Agent ── MCP ────┤                             ├── rosbridge ── MCP Server
                    └─── Physical Robot ── ROS ───┘
```

The AI agent's tool calls are identical in simulation and reality. What changes is the underlying physics and sensor characteristics. This means:
- AI orchestration logic tested in simulation works unchanged on hardware
- Safety constraints validated in simulation carry over
- Perception pipelines need domain adaptation (sim-to-real gap in vision) but the MCP interface remains stable

## Safety Patterns for Physical-World Control

When an MCP tool call can move a 50kg robot arm or drive a mobile platform, safety is not optional. The MCP specification mandates human oversight — "applications SHOULD present confirmation prompts for operations" — but provides minimal practical guidance for robotics contexts.

### The Risk Hierarchy

Not all robot commands carry equal risk:

| Risk Level | Examples | Safeguard Pattern |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Read-only** | Get sensor data, check robot pose, list topics | No confirmation needed |
| **Configuration** | Set parameters, adjust speed limits | Log and notify |
| **Movement** | Navigate to waypoint, move arm to position | Confirm first execution, allow repeat |
| **High-speed/force** | Fast arm movements, high-velocity navigation | Always confirm, enforce limits |
| **Safety-critical** | Override emergency stop, disable collision avoidance | Require explicit human approval |

### Implementing Safety in MCP-ROS Systems

**Velocity and force limits.** The MCP server should enforce maximum velocity and force limits regardless of what the AI agent requests. These limits should be configurable but defaulting to conservative values:

```python
# In the MCP server's publish handler
MAX_LINEAR_VEL = 0.5   # m/s - conservative default
MAX_ANGULAR_VEL = 0.5  # rad/s
MAX_JOINT_VEL = 0.2    # rad/s for manipulators

def validate_velocity(msg):
    """Clamp velocity commands to safe limits."""
    msg.linear.x = clamp(msg.linear.x, -MAX_LINEAR_VEL, MAX_LINEAR_VEL)
    msg.angular.z = clamp(msg.angular.z, -MAX_ANGULAR_VEL, MAX_ANGULAR_VEL)
    return msg
```

**MCP tool annotations.** The MCP specification's [tool annotations](/guides/mcp-tool-annotations-explained/) provide metadata about tool behavior. For robotics tools, key annotations include:

```json
{
  "name": "send_velocity_command",
  "annotations": {
    "destructiveHint": true,
    "idempotentHint": false,
    "openWorldHint": true
  }
}
```

`destructiveHint: true` tells the MCP client to seek user confirmation. `openWorldHint: true` indicates the tool interacts with the physical world.

**Workspace boundaries.** For manipulators, define a safe workspace and reject commands that would move the robot outside it. This is a server-side check — the AI agent doesn't need to know the boundaries:

```
Safe workspace: x ∈ [0.1, 0.8], y ∈ [-0.5, 0.5], z ∈ [0.0, 0.6] meters
Joint limits: enforced by hardware + software limits
Collision checking: enabled in MoveIt2 planning pipeline
```

**Emergency stop integration.** The MCP server should expose an `emergency_stop` tool and monitor the robot's e-stop status. If the e-stop is triggered (physically or via tool), all pending tool calls should be cancelled:

```json
{
  "name": "emergency_stop",
  "description": "Immediately halt all robot motion. Use in emergencies.",
  "annotations": {
    "destructiveHint": false,
    "idempotentHint": true
  }
}
```

**Human-in-the-loop gates.** For high-risk operations, the MCP server can use [MCP's elicitation feature](/guides/mcp-client-host-development/) to request explicit human confirmation before executing:

1. AI agent calls `move_arm_to_position(x=0.5, y=0.3, z=0.1)`
2. MCP server sends elicitation request: "Robot will move arm to (0.5, 0.3, 0.1). Approve?"
3. Human confirms or denies
4. Server executes or rejects the command

### Physical-World Threat Model

MCP in robotics faces threats beyond typical software security:

| Threat | Description | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Tool poisoning** | Malicious tool descriptions cause unsafe commands | Verify MCP server integrity, use signed tool schemas |
| **Prompt injection** | Adversarial input causes robot to perform unintended actions | Input validation, safety limits enforced server-side |
| **Sensor spoofing** | Compromised sensor data causes incorrect robot behavior | Sensor fusion, anomaly detection |
| **Replay attacks** | Captured MCP commands replayed to control robot | Session tokens, timestamps, nonce-based auth |
| **Physical proximity** | Unauthorized access to the robot's network | Network segmentation, authentication, TLS |

The fundamental principle: **safety constraints must be enforced at the server and robot level, never delegated to the AI agent.** The agent cannot be trusted to enforce its own safety boundaries — it must be constrained by the infrastructure.

## Embodied AI: LLMs as Robot Brains

MCP is arriving at the same time as a broader shift in robotics: using large language models as the high-level reasoning layer for robot autonomy. Recent research frames this as "embodied agentic AI."

### The SPCA Framework

The Sense-Plan-Code-Act (SPCA) framework (published research, 2025-2026) separates robot autonomy into stages that map naturally to MCP tool calls:

1. **Sense.** Perceive the environment through cameras, lidar, and other sensors. MCP tools provide sensor data to the AI agent.
2. **Plan.** The LLM reasons about the task and generates a high-level plan based on sensory input.
3. **Code.** The LLM generates executable code — Python scripts calling robot APIs — rather than issuing individual commands. This maps to the [code execution pattern](/guides/mcp-workflow-orchestration-frameworks/) for efficiency.
4. **Act.** The generated code executes on the robot through the ROS interface.

### ELLMER: Long-Horizon Embodied Planning

The ELLMER framework (Nature Machine Intelligence, March 2025) demonstrates that LLMs can complete long-horizon manipulation tasks in unpredictable settings. Key findings:

- LLMs handle **task decomposition** — breaking complex goals into subtask sequences
- **Tool-based interaction** — LLMs call perception and control functions rather than directly generating motor commands
- **Reactive replanning** — when perception detects unexpected states, the LLM replans rather than blindly executing
- **Force feedback integration** — LLMs interpret force sensor data to adjust manipulation strategies

This aligns perfectly with MCP's tool paradigm: expose perception and control as tools, let the LLM reason about sequencing and adaptation.

### Vision-Language Models in the Loop

Vision-language models (VLMs) add visual understanding to the MCP-robotics pipeline:

```
Camera MCP Tool → Image → VLM reasoning → Action MCP Tool → Robot
```

The AI agent sees through the robot's cameras via MCP resource tools, reasons about what it observes using its vision capabilities, and acts through MCP control tools. This closed-loop perception-action cycle is the foundation of embodied AI.

## The Emerging Robotics MCP Ecosystem

As of early 2026, the robotics MCP ecosystem spans 50+ servers across multiple categories:

### Robot Platforms
- **ROS/ROS2 bridges** — ros-mcp-server, rosbridge-mcp-server, ROS 2 Bridge, ROS 2 Robot Control
- **Specific robots** — Unitree Go integration, MOCA mobile manipulator support
- **Robot arms** — phosphobot manipulation, LeRobot dataset integration

### Smart Home (Overlapping with IoT)
- **Home Assistant** — official MCP support (2025.2+), community `ha-mcp` server (1,700+ stars, 96 tools)
- **xiaozhi-esp32** — 24,900 stars, voice AI on 70+ hardware variants

### Simulation
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** — Roba Labs MCP server
- **Gazebo** — via ROS MCP servers (same ROS interface)

For a broader view of IoT and embedded device integration, see our [MCP and IoT guide](/guides/mcp-iot-embedded-systems/). For smart home automation specifically, that guide covers Home Assistant integration in depth.

## Architecture Decision Guide

Choosing the right MCP-robotics architecture depends on your constraints:

| Factor | Direct ROS2 MCP | rosbridge MCP | Cloud-Hosted AI + Local MCP |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| **Latency** | Lowest (~1-5ms overhead) | Low (~5-20ms overhead) | Higher (network dependent) |
| **ROS version support** | ROS2 only | ROS1 + ROS2 | ROS1 + ROS2 |
| **Setup complexity** | Requires ROS2 on server | Add rosbridge node only | Requires network config |
| **AI model flexibility** | Local models only | Any MCP client | Cloud models (Claude, GPT) |
| **Safety isolation** | Same machine | Network boundary possible | Strong network isolation |
| **Best for** | Low-latency manipulation | General robot control | Remote monitoring, fleet management |

### When to Use What

**Prototyping and research:** Use rosbridge MCP with Claude Desktop. Fastest path from "I have a ROS robot" to "I can control it with natural language."

**Production manipulation:** Use a direct ROS2 MCP server with safety constraints enforced server-side. Minimize latency for real-time control.

**Fleet management:** Use cloud-hosted AI agents connecting to per-robot MCP servers. Scale AI reasoning independently of robot hardware.

**Training and simulation:** Use Gazebo or Isaac Sim with ROS MCP servers. Identical AI-side code for sim and real.

## What's Coming Next

The MCP-robotics intersection is early but moving fast:

**Action support maturation.** ROS actions (long-running tasks with feedback) mapping to MCP's async Tasks specification will enable better navigation, manipulation, and multi-step behaviors. This is the most impactful near-term development.

**Standardized robot tool schemas.** Currently each MCP server defines its own tool schemas. A community standard for robot control tools — velocity commands, navigation goals, manipulation primitives — would enable interchangeable AI agents and robot platforms.

**Perception as MCP resources.** Exposing camera feeds, point clouds, and semantic maps as [MCP resources](/guides/mcp-resources-and-roots-explained/) rather than tools would better match MCP's data model: resources for data, tools for actions.

**Multi-robot coordination.** Multiple robots sharing MCP servers through a gateway, coordinated by AI agents using [multi-agent architectures](/guides/mcp-multi-agent-architectures/). The [A2A protocol](/guides/mcp-vs-a2a-protocol-comparison/) may play a role in agent-to-agent coordination for multi-robot systems.

**Safety certification.** For industrial and commercial deployment, MCP-ROS integration will need to align with robot safety standards (ISO 10218, ISO/TS 15066 for collaborative robots). This means formal verification of safety constraints in MCP servers — a significant engineering challenge.

**On-robot AI.** Running smaller language models directly on robot hardware (NVIDIA Jetson, high-end ARM platforms), eliminating network latency entirely. The MCP server and AI agent would be co-located on the robot. For embedded hardware considerations, see our [IoT and embedded systems guide](/guides/mcp-iot-embedded-systems/).
