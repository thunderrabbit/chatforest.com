Before an MCP client can call tools, read resources, or use prompts, it needs to establish a session with the server. That session follows a defined lifecycle — initialization, operation, and shutdown — with several utility mechanisms available throughout.

This guide covers the MCP lifecycle and the four built-in utilities: **progress tracking**, **cancellation**, **logging**, and **ping**. These are the plumbing that makes MCP sessions reliable and observable.

## The Lifecycle at a Glance

Every MCP connection follows three phases:

1. **Initialization** — Client and server negotiate protocol version and capabilities
2. **Operation** — Normal message exchange based on negotiated capabilities
3. **Shutdown** — One side (usually the client) terminates the connection

The initialization phase is mandatory. No tool calls, resource reads, or prompt requests can happen until both sides complete the handshake.

## Phase 1: Initialization

The client always initiates. It sends an `initialize` request containing three things: the protocol version it supports, its capabilities, and its implementation info.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": "2025-03-26",
    "capabilities": {
      "roots": {
        "listChanged": true
      },
      "sampling": {}
    },
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "ExampleClient",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

The server responds with its own protocol version, capabilities, implementation info, and optional instructions (a free-text string the client can surface to the AI model):

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2025-03-26",
    "capabilities": {
      "logging": {},
      "prompts": {
        "listChanged": true
      },
      "resources": {
        "subscribe": true,
        "listChanged": true
      },
      "tools": {
        "listChanged": true
      }
    },
    "serverInfo": {
      "name": "ExampleServer",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    },
    "instructions": "This server provides database access tools. Use read-only queries when possible."
  }
}
```

After receiving the response, the client sends an `initialized` notification to signal it's ready for normal operations:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/initialized"
}
```

That's the complete handshake: request, response, notification. Three messages and the session is live.

### Version Negotiation

The client sends the latest protocol version it supports. If the server supports that version, it echoes it back. If not, the server responds with the latest version *it* supports. If the client can't work with the server's version, it disconnects.

This means MCP is forward-compatible by default — newer clients can connect to older servers as long as they support the server's protocol version.

### Capability Negotiation

Capabilities tell each side what optional features are available. This is how MCP avoids requiring every server to implement every feature.

**Client capabilities:**

| Capability | What it means |
|---|---|
| `roots` | Client can provide filesystem root URIs for the server |
| `sampling` | Client supports LLM sampling requests from the server |
| `experimental` | Client supports non-standard experimental features |

**Server capabilities:**

| Capability | What it means |
|---|---|
| `prompts` | Server offers reusable prompt templates |
| `resources` | Server provides readable data resources |
| `tools` | Server exposes callable tools |
| `logging` | Server emits structured log messages |
| `completions` | Server supports argument auto-completion |
| `experimental` | Server supports non-standard experimental features |

Several capabilities support sub-capabilities:
- **`listChanged`** — The server will notify the client when its list of prompts, resources, or tools changes
- **`subscribe`** — The client can subscribe to changes in individual resources

If a capability isn't declared, neither side should use it. A client that doesn't declare `sampling` won't receive sampling requests. A server that doesn't declare `tools` won't receive tool call requests.

### Initialization Rules

A few important constraints during initialization:

- The `initialize` request must **not** be part of a JSON-RPC batch — nothing else can be sent until initialization completes
- Before the server responds, the client should only send pings
- Before receiving the `initialized` notification, the server should only send pings and log messages

These rules prevent race conditions where one side tries to use features before the other is ready.

## Phase 2: Operation

Once initialized, both sides exchange messages according to their negotiated capabilities. The spec doesn't prescribe what happens here — it depends entirely on what the client and server agreed to support.

Both sides should:
- Respect the negotiated protocol version
- Only use features that were successfully negotiated
- Handle requests and notifications according to the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification

This is where the four utility mechanisms come in.

## Phase 3: Shutdown

MCP doesn't define shutdown-specific messages. Instead, shutdown uses the underlying transport:

**For stdio:** The client closes the server's stdin, waits for the server to exit, sends SIGTERM if it doesn't, and SIGKILL as a last resort. The server can also initiate by closing its stdout and exiting.

**For HTTP:** Close the HTTP connection(s). That's it.

The simplicity is intentional — transport-level disconnection is the most reliable signal that a session is over.

## Utility: Progress Tracking

Long-running operations can report progress. This is optional — neither side is required to send or request progress updates.

### How It Works

When sending a request, include a `progressToken` in the `_meta` field:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "_meta": {
      "progressToken": "op-42"
    },
    "name": "index_repository",
    "arguments": {
      "path": "/src"
    }
  }
}
```

The receiver can then send `notifications/progress` messages as work proceeds:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/progress",
  "params": {
    "progressToken": "op-42",
    "progress": 50,
    "total": 100,
    "message": "Indexing file 50 of 100..."
  }
}
```

### Progress Rules

- Progress tokens must be unique across all active requests (string or integer)
- The `progress` value must increase with each notification
- `total` is optional — omit it if the total is unknown
- `message` is optional but should be human-readable when present
- Both `progress` and `total` can be floating point
- Progress notifications must stop after the operation completes

### Timeout Interaction

Progress notifications can reset timeout clocks. If a client has a 30-second timeout on a request, receiving a progress notification proves the server is still working — so implementations may choose to restart the timer. However, there should always be a maximum timeout regardless of progress updates, to guard against misbehaving servers.

## Utility: Cancellation

Either side can cancel an in-progress request by sending a `notifications/cancelled` notification:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/cancelled",
  "params": {
    "requestId": "123",
    "reason": "User navigated away"
  }
}
```

### Cancellation Rules

- You can only cancel requests that were sent in the same direction (client cancels client-initiated requests, server cancels server-initiated requests)
- The `initialize` request must **not** be cancelled
- The `reason` field is optional but useful for logging and debugging

### What the Receiver Should Do

On receiving a cancellation:
1. Stop processing the cancelled request
2. Free associated resources
3. Don't send a response for the cancelled request

But the receiver **may** ignore the cancellation if:
- The request ID is unknown
- Processing already completed
- The operation can't be cancelled mid-flight

### Race Conditions

Cancellation is inherently racy. The notification might arrive after the response was already sent. Both sides must handle this gracefully — the sender should ignore any late-arriving response, and the receiver should treat cancellations for completed requests as no-ops.

## Utility: Logging

Servers can send structured log messages to clients. This is useful for debugging, monitoring, and giving users visibility into what the server is doing.

### Declaring the Capability

Servers that emit logs must declare the `logging` capability during initialization:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "logging": {}
  }
}
```

### Log Levels

MCP uses the standard syslog severity levels from RFC 5424:

| Level | When to use it |
|---|---|
| `debug` | Detailed debugging info (function entry/exit, variable values) |
| `info` | General progress updates |
| `notice` | Normal but significant events (configuration changes) |
| `warning` | Deprecated features, approaching limits |
| `error` | Operation failures |
| `critical` | Component failures |
| `alert` | Immediate action needed (data corruption) |
| `emergency` | System is unusable |

### Setting the Log Level

Clients can control verbosity by sending a `logging/setLevel` request:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "logging/setLevel",
  "params": {
    "level": "warning"
  }
}
```

After this, the server should only send messages at `warning` level or above.

### Log Message Format

Servers send log messages as `notifications/message`:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/message",
  "params": {
    "level": "error",
    "logger": "database",
    "data": {
      "error": "Connection failed",
      "details": {
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 5432
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `logger` field is optional and acts as a category name. The `data` field accepts any JSON-serializable value — strings, objects, arrays, whatever makes sense for the message.

### Logging Best Practices

- **Rate limit** log messages to avoid flooding the client
- **Never include** credentials, secrets, or personally identifying information
- **Use consistent** logger names across your server
- **Include relevant context** in the data field — a bare error message without context is rarely useful

## Utility: Ping

Ping is a liveness check. Either side can send it at any time to verify the connection is still alive.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "ping-1",
  "method": "ping"
}
```

The receiver must respond promptly with an empty result:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "ping-1",
  "result": {}
}
```

That's the entire mechanism. No parameters, no complexity.

### When to Use Ping

- Detecting stale connections before they cause timeout errors
- Verifying a server is still responsive during long idle periods
- Health checks in monitoring systems

If a ping goes unanswered within a reasonable timeout, the sender can consider the connection dead and either terminate or attempt reconnection.

For HTTP transports, the spec recommends preferring transport-level keepalive mechanisms (like SSE heartbeats) for idle connection maintenance, with MCP-level ping reserved for protocol-level responsiveness checks.

## Timeouts

The spec recommends that implementations set timeouts for all requests. When a request hasn't received a response within the timeout period, the sender should:

1. Send a cancellation notification for that request
2. Stop waiting for a response

SDKs should make timeouts configurable per-request, since a tool that queries a database might need 5 seconds while a tool that generates a report might need 60.

## How the Pieces Fit Together

Here's how these utilities work in a typical session:

1. **Client sends `initialize`** — negotiates capabilities including `logging` and `tools`
2. **Server responds** — confirms it supports those capabilities
3. **Client sends `initialized`** — session is live
4. **Client calls a tool** with a `progressToken` in `_meta`
5. **Server sends progress notifications** as the tool executes
6. **Server sends log messages** at `info` level for debugging
7. **User decides to cancel** — client sends `notifications/cancelled`
8. **Server stops processing**, frees resources
9. **Client pings periodically** during idle periods to verify the connection
10. **Client shuts down** by closing the transport

Each utility is independent — you can use any combination. A server that only supports tools and logging doesn't need to handle progress tokens or cancellation. A client that never sends progress tokens won't receive progress notifications.

## What Clients Support These Features

Support for lifecycle utilities varies across MCP clients:

| Feature | Claude Desktop | Claude Code | Cursor | Windsurf | Zed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Initialization handshake | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Progress display | Limited | Yes | Limited | Limited | Limited |
| Cancellation | Yes | Yes | Varies | Varies | Varies |
| Log display | Limited | Yes | Limited | Limited | Limited |
| Ping | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

All clients implement the initialization handshake — it's mandatory. Support for surfacing progress updates and log messages to users varies more widely. Claude Code tends to have the most complete utility support since it operates in a terminal where progress and log output map naturally.

## Common Mistakes

**Skipping capability checks.** Don't call `logging/setLevel` if the server didn't declare the `logging` capability. Don't send progress notifications if the request didn't include a `progressToken`.

**Non-increasing progress values.** The spec requires that each progress notification has a higher `progress` value than the previous one. Sending progress that goes backward or stays the same violates the protocol.

**Cancelling the initialize request.** The spec explicitly forbids this. Wait for initialization to complete or disconnect entirely.

**Logging sensitive data.** Log messages travel over the wire to the client. Never include API keys, passwords, tokens, or personal data in log messages.

**Ignoring timeouts.** A request without a timeout can hang indefinitely. Always set timeouts, and always send a cancellation when a timeout fires.
