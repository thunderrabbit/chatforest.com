card_description: "google-calendar-mcp (1,100 stars, 12 tools, multi-account) vs ms-365-mcp-server (547 stars, 70+ tools) vs mcp-ical (281 stars, macOS native) vs Calendly (official hosted) vs Cal.com (official) — plus CalDAV, multi-provider, and self-hosted options."
---

Calendar integration is one of the most practical MCP use cases. Checking availability, scheduling meetings, finding conflicts across accounts — these are tasks AI assistants can genuinely make faster. The ecosystem has responded with servers for every major calendar platform.

The landscape splits five ways. **Google Calendar** has the most popular dedicated server (1,100 stars, 12 tools, multi-account). **Microsoft 365** has the broadest Workspace-style servers (547 stars, 70+ tools including calendar). **Apple/macOS** has native EventKit integrations for developers in the Apple ecosystem. **Booking platforms** like Calendly and Cal.com have shipped official MCP servers. And **CalDAV** offers a universal protocol approach that works across providers.

What surprised us: **Microsoft now has an official catalog** with a dedicated Calendar remote MCP server, but it's one of 16+ servers rather than a standalone product. Meanwhile, **Calendly's fully hosted MCP** (at mcp.calendly.com) means zero infrastructure — but Google still hasn't released an official standalone calendar MCP server.

**Disclosure:** Our recommendations are based on research — analyzing documentation, GitHub repositories, community feedback, and published benchmarks. We have not hands-on tested every server in this guide.

## Three Trends Worth Watching

### 1. Official vendors are showing up — selectively

Calendly has a fully hosted MCP server. Microsoft has an official catalog with Calendar. Cal.com shipped an official server. But **Google still hasn't released an official calendar MCP server** despite being the most popular calendar platform among developers. The community servers are excellent (nspady's server has 1,100 stars and 23 releases), but the absence of an official Google server is conspicuous.

### 2. Hosted MCP is the future for booking platforms

Calendly's approach (fully hosted at mcp.calendly.com, OAuth auth, zero local setup) is likely where all SaaS calendar platforms end up. Cal.com's server still runs locally, but it's early. The distinction between "calendar" (Google/Outlook — your schedule) and "scheduling" (Calendly/Cal.com — booking with others) is driving different MCP architectures: calendar servers stay local for privacy, booking servers go remote for convenience.

### 3. Multi-provider is the real need, but the hardest problem

Most people have at least two calendars. MarimerLLC's unified server is the only one attempting true cross-provider aggregation, but at 7 stars it's early. The Apple servers that bridge iCloud+Google via sync are a pragmatic workaround. Until a dominant multi-provider server emerges, most users will need multiple MCP servers — one per calendar platform.

## What's Missing

- **No official Google Calendar MCP server** — the biggest gap. Community servers fill it well, but official backing would mean guaranteed API compatibility
- **No Outlook.com standalone server** — most Microsoft servers target M365 enterprise; personal Outlook.com users are underserved
- **No Zoom scheduling integration** — Zoom has calendar features but no MCP server for them
- **No Reclaim.ai / Motion / Clockwise MCP servers** — AI-native scheduling tools that would benefit most from MCP integration haven't shipped servers yet
- **No cross-platform free/busy aggregation** — checking availability across Google + Outlook + Apple simultaneously doesn't exist in a single tool
- **Limited recurring event intelligence** — most servers can create recurring events but can't analyze patterns or suggest optimal meeting times
- **No calendar analytics** — meeting load analysis, time allocation tracking, and scheduling pattern insights are absent from all servers
