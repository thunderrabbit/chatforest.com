Browser automation is one of the most requested capabilities for AI agents. Navigating pages, filling forms, clicking buttons, taking screenshots — these are things humans do in browsers every day, and agents need to do them too.

But there are now multiple MCP servers competing for this role, each with a different philosophy. We've spent significant time with all of them. Here's how they compare, and which one you should use.

## The Contenders

| Server | Approach | Rating | Best For |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| [Playwright MCP](/reviews/playwright-mcp-server/) | Accessibility tree targeting | 4.5/5 | Most projects |
| [Puppeteer MCP](/reviews/puppeteer-mcp-server/) | CSS selectors + screenshots | 3.5/5 | Simple tasks, legacy projects |
| [Browserbase MCP](/reviews/browserbase-mcp-server/) | Cloud-hosted browsers | 3.5/5 | Production at scale |
| Firecrawl MCP | Content extraction | — | Reading pages, not interacting |

## The Big Question: How Does the Agent "See" the Page?

This is the decision that matters most, and it separates these servers into two camps.

**Puppeteer** uses CSS selectors and screenshots. The agent takes a screenshot, uses its vision capabilities to identify what's on screen, then crafts a CSS selector like `button.submit-btn` to click it. This works, but CSS selectors are fragile — they break when class names change, when pages render dynamically, or when multiple elements match the same selector.

**Playwright** uses the accessibility tree. Instead of looking at the visual page, the agent gets a structured representation of every interactive element: "Submit button", "Email input", "Navigation menu". Elements have stable reference IDs that don't change between page loads. The agent says "click ref=e42" instead of guessing a CSS selector.

The accessibility tree approach is fundamentally more reliable. It doesn't require a vision model, doesn't break when CSS changes, and maps directly to the semantic meaning of UI elements. This is why Playwright MCP has become the default recommendation for most new projects.

**[Browserbase](/reviews/browserbase-mcp-server/)** (3.5/5) offloads the browser to the cloud. Your agent connects to a managed browser instance running on Browserbase's infrastructure, powered by Stagehand's AI-native element targeting — agents describe actions in natural language instead of crafting selectors. You don't worry about Chrome processes eating your RAM. The trade-off: you're paying for a service ($20-99+/mo after a 1-hour free tier), there's added latency from both network round-trips and LLM inference for element targeting, and the 8-tool set is thinner than Playwright's 25+.

**Firecrawl** takes a completely different approach — it's not really a browser automation server. It's a web scraping server. It extracts content from pages (converted to Markdown), crawls sitemaps, and maps websites. But it doesn't interact with pages. No clicking, no form filling, no navigation beyond URL-to-URL.

## Feature Comparison

|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Navigate pages | Yes | Yes | Yes | URL only |
| Click elements | Accessibility tree refs | CSS selectors | Yes | No |
| Fill forms | Yes + bulk fill | Yes | Yes | No |
| Take screenshots | Yes (optional) | Yes (primary) | Yes | Screenshot mode |
| Run JavaScript | Yes (`browser_console_execute`) | Yes (`puppeteer_evaluate`) | Limited | No |
| File uploads | Yes | No | Varies | No |
| Multiple browsers | Chromium, Firefox, WebKit | Chrome only | Chrome | N/A |
| Tab management | Yes | No | No | N/A |
| PDF generation | Yes | No | No | No |
| Code generation | Yes (records sessions as test scripts) | No | No | No |
| Content extraction | Via snapshots | Via JS evaluation | Via integration | Primary purpose |
| Tool count | 25+ | 7 | 8 | 6 |
| Local install | Yes | Yes | No (cloud) | No (API) |
| Cost | Free | Free | Paid | Paid (free tier) |

## Our Recommendations

### For most new projects: Playwright MCP

This is the default answer in 2026. The accessibility tree targeting makes browser automation dramatically more reliable for AI agents. The tool set is comprehensive (25+ tools), it supports three browser engines, and the ecosystem has rallied behind it — Claude Desktop, VS Code, Cursor, and 15+ other MCP clients all recommend or bundle it.

**Setup:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### For simple tasks or existing Puppeteer projects: Puppeteer MCP

If you need basic browser automation — navigate to a page, take a screenshot, fill a form — and you don't want to think about configuration, Puppeteer MCP still works. It's zero-config, straightforward, and reliable for simple use cases.

But be honest about the limitations: CSS selectors break on complex apps, it only supports Chrome, and it lacks features like file uploads and tab management. If your tasks are going to grow in complexity, start with Playwright instead.

### For production workloads at scale: [Browserbase](/reviews/browserbase-mcp-server/) (3.5/5)

If you're running agents in production that need to automate browsers across hundreds or thousands of sessions, running local Chrome processes won't scale. Browserbase gives you managed, cloud-hosted browsers with session recording, anti-bot stealth, and Stagehand's natural language element targeting.

The trade-off is cost ($20-99+/mo), vendor dependency, and a thinner tool set (8 tools vs. Playwright's 25+). There are also open bugs around screenshots and session initialization. For development and small-scale use, local Playwright is better. For production at scale, Browserbase is worth evaluating.

### For reading pages, not interacting: Firecrawl

If your agent needs to extract content from web pages — pull article text, crawl documentation sites, scrape product data — Firecrawl is the right tool. It converts web pages to clean Markdown, handles JavaScript-rendered content, and can map entire websites.

But don't try to use it for browser automation. Firecrawl reads pages; it doesn't interact with them. There's no clicking, form filling, or navigation. If you need both content extraction and interaction, use Playwright for the interaction and Firecrawl for bulk scraping.

## Decision Flowchart

**Do you need to interact with pages (click, fill forms, navigate)?**
- **No** → Use Firecrawl for content extraction
- **Yes** → Continue below

**Are you running at production scale (hundreds+ of concurrent sessions)?**
- **Yes** → Evaluate Browserbase
- **No** → Continue below

**Are your target pages complex (dynamic UIs, SPAs, frequently changing layouts)?**
- **Yes** → Use Playwright MCP (accessibility tree handles complexity)
- **No, just simple pages** → Puppeteer MCP works, but Playwright is still the safer bet

## What About Stagehand?

Stagehand (from Browserbase) takes a hybrid approach — it uses vision models and LLMs to identify page elements instead of CSS selectors or accessibility trees. Think of it as "AI-native" element targeting. It's promising for pages where neither CSS selectors nor accessibility trees work well (canvas apps, custom widgets), but it adds latency and cost from the extra LLM calls. Worth watching, not yet the default recommendation.

## The Bottom Line

The browser automation MCP space has a clear winner for 2026: **Playwright MCP**. The accessibility tree approach is the right architecture for AI agents, and the ecosystem has validated this with broad adoption. Start there unless you have a specific reason not to.
