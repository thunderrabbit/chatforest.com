There are over 12,000 MCP servers listed across various directories. We've [reviewed more than 200](/reviews/) of them in depth. The biggest challenge isn't finding an MCP server — it's choosing the right one.

This guide gives you a structured framework for evaluating MCP servers before committing to one. Whether you're picking a database connector, a cloud integration, or a specialized tool, these criteria apply.

## The Five-Factor Evaluation Framework

When we evaluate MCP servers at ChatForest, we look at five factors. Here they are, roughly in order of importance:

### 1. Maintenance and Community Health

This is the single most important factor. An unmaintained MCP server is a liability, no matter how feature-rich it is.

**What to check:**

- **Last commit date** — Is the repo actively maintained? Servers with no commits in 3+ months are risky.
- **Open issues vs. closed issues** — A healthy ratio suggests the maintainer is engaged. Dozens of unanswered issues is a red flag.
- **Release cadence** — Regular releases suggest ongoing investment. A single release with no follow-up suggests a weekend project.
- **GitHub stars and forks** — Not a quality metric per se, but it indicates community interest. More users means more bug reports and more pressure to maintain.
- **Who's behind it** — Official servers from the tool vendor (e.g., [GitHub's own MCP server](/reviews/github-mcp-server/), [Stripe's official server](/reviews/stripe-mcp-server/)) tend to be better maintained than community alternatives.

**Quick heuristic:** If a server hasn't been updated in 90 days and has open issues without responses, look for alternatives.

### 2. Security Posture

MCP servers often have access to sensitive systems — databases, cloud accounts, file systems, API keys. Security isn't optional.

**What to check:**

- **Authentication model** — Does the server use OAuth, API keys, or no auth at all? Prefer servers that follow the principle of least privilege.
- **Input validation** — Does the server validate and sanitize inputs, or does it pass raw user input to external systems? This matters especially for [database servers](/guides/best-database-mcp-servers/) and anything that executes code.
- **Scope of access** — A server that requests full admin access when it only needs read access is poorly designed.
- **Dependency hygiene** — Check the dependency tree. Servers with hundreds of transitive dependencies have a larger attack surface.
- **License** — Open-source servers let you audit the code. Closed-source servers require more trust.

For a deeper dive, see our [MCP Server Security Guide](/guides/mcp-server-security/).

### 3. Feature Completeness and API Coverage

More tools doesn't always mean better. What matters is whether the server covers *your* use case.

**What to check:**

- **Tool count vs. tool quality** — Some servers expose hundreds of auto-generated tools from an OpenAPI spec. Others offer 5-10 carefully designed tools that actually work well with LLMs. The latter is usually better.
- **API coverage** — If you need a specific feature (e.g., writing to a database, not just reading), verify the server supports it. Many servers are read-only.
- **Tool descriptions** — LLMs choose which tools to call based on their descriptions. Poor descriptions lead to poor tool selection, regardless of what the tool actually does.
- **Error handling** — Does the server return helpful error messages, or does it crash silently? Try to find information about error handling in the docs or issues.

**Quick heuristic:** A server with 8 well-documented tools almost always outperforms one with 80 auto-generated tools.

### 4. Performance and Transport

For interactive use cases, latency matters. For batch workflows, throughput matters.

**What to check:**

- **Transport type** — stdio (local) is fastest but requires the server to run on your machine. Streamable HTTP (remote) adds network latency but enables shared deployments.
- **Startup time** — Some servers take seconds to initialize. If you're spinning up servers per-request, this adds up.
- **Response latency** — For real-time use, sub-second responses are ideal. Check if the server adds significant overhead on top of the underlying API.
- **Resource consumption** — Some servers are lightweight; others pull in heavy frameworks. This matters if you're running multiple servers simultaneously.

### 5. Integration Fit

The best MCP server for a given tool is the one that fits your existing setup.

**What to check:**

- **Language ecosystem** — If your team works in Python, a Python-based server is easier to debug, extend, and contribute to than one in TypeScript (and vice versa).
- **Client compatibility** — Most servers work with most clients, but edge cases exist. Verify compatibility with your specific client (Claude Desktop, VS Code, custom framework, etc.).
- **Configuration complexity** — How many environment variables, config files, or setup steps are needed? Simpler is better, especially for team-wide adoption.
- **Composability** — Can you run this server alongside others without conflicts? Some servers try to do everything; others focus on one thing well. The focused ones are usually easier to compose.

## Decision Flowchart

Here's a quick way to narrow down your options:

```
1. Is there an OFFICIAL server from the tool vendor?
   ├─ Yes → Start there. It's usually the best-maintained option.
   └─ No → Continue to step 2.

2. Are there multiple community servers?
   ├─ Yes → Compare on: stars, last commit, issue activity, tool count.
   └─ No → Evaluate the single option against the five factors above.

3. Does the top candidate meet your security requirements?
   ├─ Yes → Test it in your workflow.
   └─ No → Consider forking and hardening, or building your own.

4. Does it cover your specific use case?
   ├─ Yes → Ship it.
   └─ No → Check if combining it with another server fills the gap.
```

## Common Pitfalls

Based on patterns we've seen across 200+ server reviews:

**Picking the server with the most stars.** Stars correlate with visibility, not quality. A server with 500 stars and active maintenance often beats one with 5,000 stars and no updates in six months.

**Choosing feature count over feature quality.** Auto-generated servers that wrap an entire API surface sound impressive but often produce poor results with LLMs. The tools have generic descriptions, no examples, and no optimization for how AI models actually work.

**Ignoring the "archived" status.** Several once-popular servers have been archived or abandoned. Always check the repo status before committing. We flag archived servers in our reviews.

**Not testing with your actual client.** A server that works great in Claude Desktop might behave differently in VS Code or a custom agent. Test in your actual environment before depending on it.

**Over-relying on a single server.** MCP's strength is composability. Instead of looking for one server that does everything, consider combining focused servers that each do one thing well.

## How ChatForest Ratings Map to This Framework

Our [review ratings](/reviews/) are based on a weighted version of these five factors:

| Rating | What it means |
|--------|--------------|
| 4.5-5/5 | Strong across all factors. Official backing or exceptional community. Active maintenance. |
| 4/5 | Solid choice with minor gaps. Good maintenance, good features, maybe lacking in one area. |
| 3.5/5 | Decent option with caveats. May have maintenance concerns or incomplete API coverage. |
| 3/5 | Usable but with significant limitations. Often thin ecosystems or early-stage projects. |
| Below 3 | Proceed with caution. Usually indicates abandoned projects or fundamental design issues. |

## Bottom Line

Choosing an MCP server comes down to: **Is it maintained? Is it secure? Does it do what I need? Is it fast enough? Does it fit my setup?**

If you can answer yes to all five, you've found your server. If not, the framework above helps you identify exactly where the gaps are — and whether they're deal-breakers or acceptable trade-offs.
