Vector databases find text that *sounds* similar to your query. Knowledge graphs find facts that are *structurally connected* to your query. For AI agents that need to reason across relationships — "which team members worked on projects that depend on this service?" or "what drugs interact with this patient's current medications?" — graph structure matters more than embedding similarity.

This guide covers how MCP connects AI agents to knowledge graphs, when GraphRAG outperforms vector RAG, the available MCP servers for graph databases, and practical architecture patterns for building graph-powered AI systems. Our analysis draws on official documentation, published benchmarks, and open-source implementations — we research and analyze rather than deploying these systems ourselves.

## Why Knowledge Graphs for AI Agents

Traditional RAG works by embedding documents into vectors, finding the closest matches to a query, and injecting those chunks into the prompt. This works well for "find me information about X" queries. It breaks down when the answer requires connecting multiple facts across different documents.

Consider these questions:

- **Single-hop** (vector RAG handles well): "What is the side effect profile of Drug A?"
- **Multi-hop** (vector RAG struggles): "Which patients are taking Drug A *and* also taking medications that interact with Drug A's metabolites?"

The multi-hop question requires traversing relationships: patient → medications → drug interactions → metabolite pathways. A vector database would need to retrieve and cross-reference multiple chunks, hoping the model can stitch together the connections. A knowledge graph stores these relationships explicitly and can traverse them in a single query.

### What Knowledge Graphs Add

A knowledge graph represents information as **entities** (nodes) connected by **relationships** (edges), with properties on both. Unlike flat document stores:

| Capability | Vector Database | Knowledge Graph |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **Query type** | "Find text similar to X" | "Find entities connected to X via relationship Y" |
| **Reasoning depth** | Single-hop (semantic similarity) | Multi-hop (relationship traversal) |
| **Data model** | Unstructured chunks + embeddings | Structured entities + typed relationships |
| **Accuracy for relationships** | Probabilistic (may hallucinate connections) | Deterministic (relationships are explicit) |
| **Update granularity** | Re-embed entire chunks | Update individual facts and relationships |
| **Explainability** | "This chunk was similar" | "Entity A → relates to → Entity B → connects to → Entity C" |

The key insight: knowledge graphs don't replace vector databases — they solve different problems. The [2026 industry consensus](https://ninthpost.com/rag-vs-graph-rag/) is that hybrid approaches (vector search for broad retrieval, graph traversal for relationship reasoning) outperform either alone.

## GraphRAG vs Vector RAG: When to Use Which

GraphRAG refers to retrieval-augmented generation that uses a knowledge graph as its retrieval backend instead of (or alongside) a vector store. The approach was [popularized by Microsoft's GraphRAG research](https://www.articsledge.com/post/graphrag-retrieval-augmented-generation) and has since been adopted across the ecosystem.

### How GraphRAG Works

1. **Ingest**: Documents are processed to extract entities and relationships, which are stored as a knowledge graph
2. **Query**: The user's question is mapped to graph entities, then the system traverses k-hop paths to collect a subgraph of supporting evidence
3. **Generate**: The LLM receives the structured subgraph as context, grounding its response in explicit relationships rather than approximate text similarity

### Decision Framework

**Use Vector RAG when:**
- Questions are primarily "what does X mean?" or "tell me about Y"
- Content is mostly unstructured text (articles, documentation, transcripts)
- You need fast, simple retrieval with minimal infrastructure
- Time-sensitivity matters — vector stores update faster than graph construction

**Use GraphRAG when:**
- Questions require connecting facts across multiple documents or data sources
- Your domain has strong entity-relationship structure (medical, legal, financial, organizational)
- Accuracy on relationship queries matters more than retrieval speed
- You need explainable reasoning chains ("here's the path from A to B")

**Use hybrid (vector + graph) when:**
- You have both unstructured content and structured relationships
- Some queries are simple lookups, others require multi-hop reasoning
- You want vector search for initial broad retrieval, then graph traversal for refinement
- This is the most common production pattern in 2026

## MCP Servers for Knowledge Graphs

Several MCP servers expose knowledge graph capabilities to AI agents. Here's the current landscape:

### Neo4j MCP Servers

[Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) is the most mature graph database, and its MCP ecosystem is the most comprehensive.

**[Official Neo4j MCP Server](https://github.com/neo4j/mcp)** — Production-ready binary supporting all deployment types (Aura, self-managed, Docker, Desktop, Sandbox):
- Schema retrieval — agents discover the graph structure
- Read/write Cypher execution — full query capabilities
- Graph algorithm execution via GDS plugin (centrality, path-finding, community detection)
- Supports stdio and HTTP transports with custom SSL certificates

**[Neo4j Labs MCP Servers](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j)** — Specialized servers for different use cases:

| Server | Purpose | Key Tools |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **mcp-neo4j-cypher** | LLM-driven database queries | `get-neo4j-schema`, `read-neo4j-cypher`, `write-neo4j-cypher` |
| **mcp-neo4j-memory** | Knowledge graph as agent memory | Create/delete entities, manage observations, search subgraphs |
| **mcp-neo4j-data-modeling** | Schema design and validation | Mermaid visualization, Cypher constraint generation, 7 templates |
| **mcp-neo4j-gds** | Graph algorithms as tools | Centrality, path-finding, community detection |
| **mcp-neo4j-aura-manager** | Infrastructure management | Instance create/pause/resume/scale, tenant administration |

The memory server is particularly interesting for agent architectures — it stores conversational context as a knowledge graph rather than flat text, enabling agents to recall structured relationships from prior interactions.

### Memgraph MCP Server

[Memgraph](https://memgraph.com/) is an in-memory graph database optimized for real-time streaming and low-latency queries. Its [official MCP server](https://memgraph.com/blog/introducing-memgraph-mcp-server) exposes:

- **`run_query()` tool** — execute Cypher queries against Memgraph
- **`get_schema()` resource** — retrieve schema information via `SHOW SCHEMA INFO`

The setup is straightforward: clone the repository, install dependencies with `uv`, and configure Claude Desktop to point at the server. Memgraph's strength is speed — for real-time agent memory or streaming graph updates, it outperforms disk-based alternatives.

### FalkorDB + Graphiti MCP Server

[Graphiti](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti) (by Zep) builds real-time knowledge graphs from conversations, backed by [FalkorDB](https://www.falkordb.com/). This MCP server is purpose-built for **agent memory**:

- Automatically extracts entities and relationships from dialogue
- Organizes conversation turns as temporal episodes
- Uses `group_id` namespacing for multi-tenant isolation
- Preserves explicit, queryable connections between facts

Unlike vector-based memory (which finds "similar" past conversations), Graphiti's graph memory enables agents to trace specific relationship chains: "The user mentioned they work at Company X, which uses Technology Y, which relates to Problem Z they described three sessions ago."

Setup via Docker:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/getzep/graphiti
cd graphiti/mcp_server
docker-compose up
```

### PuppyGraph MCP Server

[PuppyGraph](https://www.puppygraph.com/) provides a graph query layer over existing data stores without requiring data migration. Its [MCP server](https://lobehub.com/mcp/puppygraph-puppygraph-mcp-server) supports both Gremlin and Cypher queries through Claude, connecting via Neo4j Bolt protocol (Cypher) or WebSocket (Gremlin). Useful for organizations that want graph capabilities over existing relational or lake data.

### Comparison

| MCP Server | Best For | Query Language | Unique Strength |
|-----------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Neo4j Official** | Production graph workloads | Cypher | Most complete — schema, read/write, algorithms |
| **Neo4j Memory** | Agent memory as graph | Cypher | Structured conversation recall |
| **Memgraph** | Real-time, low-latency | Cypher | In-memory speed for streaming graphs |
| **Graphiti/FalkorDB** | Conversational memory | Cypher | Auto-extraction from dialogue, temporal episodes |
| **PuppyGraph** | Graph queries over existing data | Cypher + Gremlin | No data migration required |

## Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Graph Querying

The simplest pattern — an agent connects to a graph database MCP server and queries it directly.

```
User Question → Agent → [MCP] → Graph DB → Cypher results → Agent → Response
```

**When to use:** Your knowledge is already in a graph database. The agent needs to answer relationship queries, run graph algorithms, or explore connected data.

**How it works:** The agent uses the schema tool to understand available node types and relationships, constructs Cypher queries based on the user's question, and interprets results. The MCP server handles connection management and query execution.

**Example flow:**
1. Agent calls `get-neo4j-schema` — learns the graph has `Person`, `Company`, `Project` nodes with `WORKS_AT`, `CONTRIBUTES_TO` relationships
2. User asks: "Who at Company X has worked on projects related to authentication?"
3. Agent constructs: `MATCH (p:Person)-[:WORKS_AT]->(c:Company {name: 'Company X'}), (p)-[:CONTRIBUTES_TO]->(proj:Project) WHERE proj.tags CONTAINS 'authentication' RETURN p.name, proj.name`
4. Agent returns structured results with the relationship path

### Pattern 2: Hybrid Vector + Graph Retrieval

Combines vector search for initial retrieval with graph traversal for relationship enrichment.

```
User Question → Agent → [MCP] → Vector DB → initial results
                     → [MCP] → Graph DB  → relationship context
                     → Combined context → Response
```

**When to use:** You have both unstructured documents (manuals, articles, transcripts) and structured relationships (org charts, dependency maps, regulatory hierarchies). This is the most common production pattern.

**How it works:** The agent first queries a [vector database MCP server](/guides/best-vector-database-mcp-servers/) for semantically relevant documents, then queries the knowledge graph to enrich those results with relationship context. The model receives both the relevant text and the structured connections.

### Pattern 3: Graph-Based Agent Memory

Uses a knowledge graph as the agent's persistent memory instead of (or alongside) vector-based memory.

```
Conversation → Graphiti MCP → Extract entities/relationships → Store in graph
Later query  → Graphiti MCP → Traverse relationship paths    → Return context
```

**When to use:** Your agent has long-running conversations where context from earlier sessions matters. Particularly valuable when the user's situation involves interconnected facts — people, projects, preferences, decisions — that the agent needs to recall and connect.

**How it works:** The Graphiti MCP server (or Neo4j Memory server) automatically extracts entities and relationships from each conversation. When the agent needs context, it queries the graph for relevant subgraphs rather than searching for similar text. This enables precise recall: "The user told me they manage Team Alpha, which is working on Project Beta, which has a dependency on Service Gamma" — a chain that embedding similarity would struggle to reconstruct.

### Pattern 4: Graph-Guided Tool Selection

Uses the knowledge graph to determine *which tools* or *which data sources* the agent should query for a given request.

```
User Question → Agent → [MCP] → Knowledge Graph → relevant tools/sources
                     → [MCP] → Selected tools   → results
                     → Response
```

**When to use:** Your agent has access to many tools and data sources, and you need intelligent routing. The graph encodes which tools are relevant for which domains, which data sources cover which topics, and which permissions apply.

**How it works:** The knowledge graph contains metadata about available tools, their capabilities, data coverage, and access requirements. When a request arrives, the agent first queries the graph to identify the right tools, then invokes only those tools. This is related to the [RAG-for-tool-selection pattern](/guides/mcp-rag-patterns/) but uses graph traversal instead of embedding similarity for more precise routing.

## Building Knowledge Graphs for Agent Use

If you're starting from scratch, here's how to approach building a knowledge graph that agents can use effectively via MCP.

### Schema Design Principles

**Start narrow, expand later.** Define the core entity types and relationships your agent actually needs. A graph with 5 well-defined node types is more useful than one with 50 poorly connected types.

**Design for traversal.** Think about the questions your agent will answer, then design the schema to make those traversals efficient:
- "Which team members have experience with Technology X?" → `Person -[:HAS_SKILL]-> Technology`
- "What services depend on this database?" → `Service -[:DEPENDS_ON]-> Database`
- "What's the approval chain for this change?" → `Change -[:REQUIRES_APPROVAL_FROM]-> Role -[:FILLED_BY]-> Person`

**Include temporal edges when relevant.** Relationships change over time. If your agent needs to reason about "who was responsible for this in Q3?" versus "who is responsible now?", add time properties to relationships.

### Entity Extraction Approaches

Building the graph requires extracting entities and relationships from your source data:

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **LLM-based extraction** | Handles unstructured text well, adapts to new domains | Expensive at scale, may hallucinate relationships |
| **Rule-based extraction** | Deterministic, fast, cheap | Requires domain-specific rules, brittle |
| **Hybrid** | LLM for novel extraction, rules for known patterns | More complex to maintain |
| **Graphiti auto-extraction** | Real-time from conversations, no pipeline needed | Limited to conversational data |

For agents that learn from conversations, Graphiti's auto-extraction is the most practical starting point. For building graphs from existing document collections, LLM-based extraction pipelines (using the LLM itself as the extractor) are the standard approach in 2026.

### Query Patterns for Agents

Agents interacting with knowledge graphs through MCP typically use these Cypher patterns:

**Neighborhood queries** — find everything connected to an entity:
```cypher
MATCH (n {name: $entity})-[r]-(connected)
RETURN n, r, connected LIMIT 20
```

**Path queries** — find how two entities are connected:
```cypher
MATCH path = shortestPath((a {name: $from})-[*..5]-(b {name: $to}))
RETURN path
```

**Pattern matching** — find entities matching a structural pattern:
```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)-[:WORKS_ON]->(proj:Project)-[:USES]->(tech:Technology {name: $tech})
RETURN p.name, proj.name
```

**Aggregation queries** — summarize graph structure:
```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)-[:WORKS_ON]->(proj:Project)
RETURN proj.name, count(p) as team_size
ORDER BY team_size DESC
```

The agent discovers available node types and relationships via the schema tool, then constructs queries appropriate to the user's question. The MCP server handles parameterization and execution.

## Production Considerations

### Performance

Knowledge graph queries can be fast (single-hop lookups in milliseconds) or slow (unbounded traversals across millions of nodes). For MCP-connected agents:

- **Set traversal depth limits** — unbounded `[*]` patterns can explode. Use `[*..3]` or `[*..5]` to cap depth
- **Use Memgraph for latency-sensitive workloads** — in-memory graph processing avoids disk I/O
- **Index entity properties** that agents query frequently — name, type, and identifier fields
- **Consider read replicas** if multiple agents query the same graph concurrently

### Security

Graph databases expose powerful query capabilities. When connecting via MCP:

- **Use read-only connections by default** — most agent queries are reads. Only enable writes through a separate, controlled MCP server
- **Restrict Cypher capabilities** — some MCP servers support query allowlists or deny patterns (e.g., block `DELETE`, `DETACH DELETE`)
- **Scope access per agent** — not every agent should see every subgraph. Use Neo4j's role-based access or Memgraph's fine-grained permissions
- **Audit queries** — log what Cypher queries agents execute for compliance and debugging
- See our [MCP security guide](/guides/mcp-server-security/) and [credential management guide](/guides/mcp-credential-secret-management/) for broader security patterns

### When Not to Use Knowledge Graphs

Knowledge graphs add complexity. Don't use them when:

- **Your queries are simple lookups** — "What does our refund policy say?" is a vector RAG question, not a graph question
- **You don't have structured relationships** — if your data is unstructured text without clear entities and connections, a knowledge graph adds overhead without benefit
- **Your data changes too rapidly for graph construction** — building and maintaining a knowledge graph requires an extraction pipeline. If your content changes hourly, the graph may lag behind
- **Your team can't maintain graph schemas** — knowledge graphs require schema design and evolution. If nobody owns this, the graph degrades quickly
