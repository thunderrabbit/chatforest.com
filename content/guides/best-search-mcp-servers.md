Search is the most fundamental capability an AI agent can have. Without it, your agent is limited to its training data and whatever files you give it access to. With it, your agent can verify facts, find documentation, research competitors, and stay current.

The MCP ecosystem now has over a dozen search servers, and they take fundamentally different approaches. Some match keywords. Some understand meaning. Some don't even return search results — they return answers. Picking the wrong one means your agent is either missing relevant results or burning tokens on noise.

We've [reviewed the Brave Search MCP server](/reviews/brave-search-mcp-server/) (4/5), the [Exa MCP server](/reviews/exa-mcp-server/) (4/5), the [Tavily MCP server](/reviews/tavily-mcp-server/) (4/5), and the [Perplexity MCP server](/reviews/perplexity-mcp-server/) (4/5). Here's how the full search landscape compares, and which one you should actually use.

## The Contenders

| Server | Stars | Tools | Search Type | Free Tier | Paid (per 1K) | Best For |
|--------|-------|-------|-------------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| [Brave Search](/reviews/brave-search-mcp-server/) | 811 | 6 | Keyword | $5/mo credit | $5 | General-purpose search |
| [Exa](/reviews/exa-mcp-server/) | 4,100 | 4 | Semantic/neural | $10 credit | ~$7 | Research & concept search |
| [Tavily](/reviews/tavily-mcp-server/) | 1,500 | 4 | Keyword + extract | 1K credits/mo | ~$8 | RAG pipelines |
| [Perplexity](/reviews/perplexity-mcp-server/) | 2,000 | 4 | Answer engine | None (paid only) | $5 + tokens | Synthesized answers |
| Kagi | 334 | 2 | Curated keyword | None (closed beta) | $25 | Privacy + quality |
| Linkup | 24 | 2 | Factual retrieval | 5 EUR/mo credit | €0.50 cents | Factual accuracy |

**Notable absence:** There is no official Google Search MCP server. Google has released MCP servers for Maps, Drive, and other Cloud services, but not for web search. Community wrappers exist (via SerpAPI or Playwright scraping), but none are first-party or reliable enough to recommend.

## The Three Search Paradigms

Search MCP servers fall into three distinct categories, and understanding these matters more than comparing feature lists:

### 1. Keyword Search (Brave, Kagi)
Traditional search: your agent sends a query string, the engine matches it against an index, and returns ranked links with snippets. This is what Google does and what most people think of as "search."

**When it works best:** Specific queries with known terms — "pandas DataFrame merge syntax", "Next.js 15 release date", "sentry-mcp-server npm." When your agent knows what words the answer contains, keyword search is fast and precise.

**When it fails:** Conceptual queries — "startups building developer tools for LLM observability" — where the right results might not contain those exact words.

### 2. Semantic Search (Exa, Linkup)
Neural search: the query is converted to an embedding, and results are ranked by conceptual similarity rather than keyword overlap. Exa's neural index understands that "companies making AI debugging tools" and "LLM observability platform" are related concepts, even though they share no words.

**When it works best:** Research, exploration, discovering companies or tools you don't know the name of yet. Exa scores 81% on the WebWalker benchmark vs Tavily's 71% specifically because semantic matching handles ambiguous queries better.

**When it fails:** Exact lookups where you need a specific page. Semantic search can over-generalize — searching for a specific error message might return conceptually related but wrong results.

### 3. Answer Engines (Perplexity Sonar)
Instead of returning links, the engine reads the search results for you and returns a synthesized answer with citations. Your agent gets "the answer" rather than "pages that might contain the answer."

**When it works best:** Direct questions — "what's the current price of Anthropic's API?", "how does MCP transport work?" — where your agent needs a fact, not a list of pages to read.

**When it fails:** When your agent needs to evaluate primary sources itself, or when the answer requires nuance the synthesis model might flatten. You lose control over which sources inform the response.

## The Servers in Detail

### Brave Search MCP — The All-Rounder

**[brave/brave-search-mcp-server](https://github.com/brave/brave-search-mcp-server)** | [Our full review](/reviews/brave-search-mcp-server/) | Rating: 4/5

Brave is the Swiss Army knife of search MCP servers. Six tools cover web, local, image, video, news, and AI summarization — more search modalities than any competitor. It runs on Brave's independent index (30B+ pages), not a Google or Bing wrapper, which means different results and genuine independence.

**Why it's good:**
- Six specialized tools — image, video, news, and local search are capabilities no other search MCP server offers
- Privacy-first: no tracking, no user profiling, independent index
- Clean, well-documented TypeScript codebase maintained by Brave
- v2.x actively developed with breaking changes (sign of investment, not neglect)

**What changed recently:** Brave dropped its unlimited free tier in February 2026. New users now get a $5/month credit (~1,000 queries). Existing free-tier users are grandfathered in. This caused community friction but the pricing is still competitive.

**The catch:** Search quality trails semantic search engines on conceptual queries. No retry logic for rate limits. The summarizer tool requires a separate API tier.

**Best for:** General-purpose agent search. If you need one search server and your queries are specific (documentation lookups, fact-checking, API references), Brave is the default choice.

### Exa MCP — The Research Engine

**[exa-labs/exa-mcp-server](https://github.com/exa-labs/exa-mcp-server)** | [Our full review](/reviews/exa-mcp-server/) | Rating: 4/5

Exa is the most powerful search MCP server for research workflows. Its neural search genuinely understands concepts, not just keywords. Query-dependent highlights cut token usage by 50–75% by extracting only the relevant passages from each result. In March 2026, Exa consolidated from 9 tools down to 4, deprecating specialized tools in favor of a unified `web_search_advanced_exa` that covers company research, people search, and other categories through filter parameters.

**Why it's good:**
- Semantic search that measurably outperforms keyword matching (81% vs 71% on WebWalker)
- Four active tools after March 2026 consolidation: `web_search_exa`, `web_search_advanced_exa`, `get_code_context_exa`, and `crawling_exa` — six specialized tools (company research, people search, deep search, LinkedIn search) were deprecated in favor of `web_search_advanced_exa`
- Query-dependent highlights save tokens on content extraction
- `web_search_advanced_exa` covers company, research paper, financial report, and tweet categories with full filter capabilities
- 4,100 GitHub stars — largest community of any search MCP server

**What changed recently:** In March 2026, Exa consolidated from 9 tools down to 4 by deprecating six specialized tools (`company_research_exa`, `people_search_exa`, `deep_search_exa`, `deep_researcher_start/check`, `linkedin_search_exa`) in favor of the unified `web_search_advanced_exa`. Existing users retain backward compatibility, but new setups should use the consolidated tools. Bearer token authentication was also added alongside the existing query parameter method.

**The catch:** Complex per-operation pricing that's hard to predict. Filter restrictions fail silently with opaque 400 errors. No offline or self-hosted option. The hosted endpoint has had timeout issues under load.

**Best for:** Research-heavy workflows — market analysis, competitive intelligence, exploring unfamiliar domains. When your agent needs to find things it doesn't know the name of yet.

### Tavily MCP — The RAG Specialist

**[tavily-ai/tavily-mcp](https://github.com/tavily-ai/tavily-mcp)** | [Our full review](/reviews/tavily-mcp-server/) | Rating: 4/5 | 1,500 stars

Tavily is the search API most AI frameworks integrate by default. LangChain, LlamaIndex, and the Vercel AI SDK all have Tavily adapters out of the box. If you're building a RAG pipeline, Tavily is the path of least resistance.

**Tools (4):**
- `tavily-search` — Web search with configurable depth (basic or advanced)
- `tavily-extract` — Extract structured content from specific URLs
- `tavily-map` — Crawl a site and return a structured sitemap
- `tavily-crawl` — Recursively crawl pages from a starting URL

**Why it's good:**
- Best ecosystem integration — if your stack includes LangChain or LlamaIndex, Tavily works out of the box
- Remote MCP server with OAuth (no API key management)
- Search + extract in one pipeline — find pages then pull structured content
- Site mapping and crawling tools go beyond basic search

**The catch:** Keyword-based search, not semantic — scores 71% on WebWalker vs Exa's 81%. Acquired by Nebius in February 2026, introducing roadmap uncertainty. Free tier credits don't roll over and expire after 90 days. At scale (100K queries), costs reach ~$800/month.

**Best for:** RAG pipelines and agent frameworks. If you're building with LangChain or LlamaIndex, Tavily's native integration removes friction. The crawl and extract tools also make it useful for content ingestion workflows.

### [Perplexity MCP](/reviews/perplexity-mcp-server/) — The Answer Engine (4/5)

**[perplexityai/modelcontextprotocol](https://github.com/perplexityai/modelcontextprotocol)** | 2,000 stars | v0.8.4 | [Full review](/reviews/perplexity-mcp-server/)

Perplexity Sonar is fundamentally different from the other servers here. Instead of returning search results for your agent to read, it returns synthesized answers with citations. It's not a search engine — it's an answer engine accessed through MCP.

**Tools (4):**
- `perplexity_search` — Search API returning ranked results (closest to traditional search)
- `perplexity_ask` — Conversational answers using sonar-pro
- `perplexity_research` — Deep research reports using sonar-deep-research
- `perplexity_reason` — Step-by-step reasoning with sonar-reasoning-pro (unique among search MCPs)

**Why it's good:**
- Returns answers, not links — eliminates the "search, read page, extract answer" pipeline
- Multiple model tiers: fast sonar for quick lookups, deep research for comprehensive reports, reasoning for logic-heavy questions
- Zero open issues — best maintenance record of any search MCP server
- One-click installers for Cursor and VS Code, Docker support, proxy configuration for enterprise
- Citation tokens no longer billed (2026 cost cut)
- v0.8.4 (March 2026) with security updates — actively maintained

**The catch:** No free tier — highest entry barrier in the search category. Deep research can timeout in clients with short tool-call limits. Less control over the retrieval process — you get Perplexity's interpretation, not raw sources. Per-token pricing is harder to predict than flat-rate alternatives.

**Best for:** When your agent needs facts, not research. Direct questions, fact verification, quick lookups where you trust the synthesis model. Also strong for step-by-step reasoning tasks via the unique `perplexity_reason` tool.

### Kagi MCP — The Privacy Purist

**[kagisearch/kagimcp](https://github.com/kagisearch/kagimcp)** | 334 stars

Kagi is the search engine for people who pay for ad-free, tracker-free, high-quality results. Their MCP server extends this to agents — but with significant access barriers.

**Tools (2):**
- Search tool — Kagi Search API with human-curated ranking signals
- Summarizer tool — Summarize URLs or videos using multiple engines (Cecil, Daphne, etc.)

**Why it's good:**
- Ad-free index with human-curated ranking signals — consistently high-quality results
- No tracking, no profiling — strongest privacy stance of any search MCP
- Unique multi-engine summarizer with different models for different content types

**The catch:** The Search API is in closed beta — you must email support@kagi.com to request access. Requires an existing Kagi subscription ($5–$25/month) on top of API costs. Highest per-query price at $0.025/search ($25 per 1K). Only 2 tools — minimal feature set compared to Brave's 6.

**Best for:** Existing Kagi subscribers who want their agent to use the same ad-free, high-quality search they use personally. Not practical for most users until the API exits closed beta.

### Linkup MCP — The Factual Accuracy Play

**[LinkupPlatform/linkup-mcp-server](https://github.com/LinkupPlatform/linkup-mcp-server)** | 24 stars

Linkup positions itself as the most factually accurate search API, citing a #1 ranking on OpenAI's SimpleQA benchmark. The MCP server is simple — two tools, three search depth modes — but the accuracy claim is worth evaluating.

**Tools (2):**
- `linkup-search` — Web search with fast, standard, or deep depth modes
- `linkup-fetch` — URL content extraction with optional JavaScript rendering

**Why it's good:**
- Claims #1 on SimpleQA factuality benchmark — if true, strong for fact-checking workflows
- Three depth modes let you trade cost for thoroughness
- Flat, predictable pricing (€0.50 cents per standard search)

**The catch:** Tiny community (24 stars). Only 2 tools. Last release v2.1.0 in October 2025 — **dormant for 5 months** with no commits since. Limited documentation. The factuality claim is based on a single benchmark and hasn't been independently verified by third parties.

**Best for:** Fact-checking workflows where accuracy matters more than features. But the small community and stale development are red flags — evaluate carefully before committing.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Brave | Exa | Tavily | Perplexity | Kagi | Linkup |
|---------|-------|-----|--------|------------|------|--------|
| Search type | Keyword | Semantic | Keyword | Answer engine | Keyword | Factual |
| Number of tools | 6 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 2 |
| Web search | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

| OAuth / keyless setup | No | No | Yes | No | No | No |

## Pricing Comparison

All search MCP servers require API keys (except Tavily's remote MCP, which uses OAuth). Here's what they actually cost:

| Server | Free Tier | Per Search (Paid) | 10K Searches/mo | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| Brave | $5/mo credit (~1K queries) | $0.005 | ~$50 | Free tier changed Feb 2026 |
| Exa | $10 one-time credit | $0.007 (search+contents) | ~$70 | Deep search costs $0.012 |
| Tavily | 1K credits/mo (90-day trial) | $0.008 | ~$80 | Credits don't roll over |
| Perplexity | $5/mo (Pro subscribers) | $0.005 + token costs | ~$50+ | Token costs vary by model tier |
| Kagi | None | $0.025 | $250 | Requires subscription + closed beta |
| Linkup | €5/mo credit (~1K) | €0.005 | ~€50 | Flat pricing, predictable |

**Cheapest at scale:** Brave and Perplexity (base rate), but Perplexity adds token costs. Brave is the most predictable for budget planning.

**Most expensive:** Kagi at 5x the cost of Brave, plus subscription requirements.

## Which One Should You Use?

### Start here: What kind of queries does your agent run?

**"Find the docs for X" / "What's the latest version of Y"**
→ **Brave Search.** Specific, keyword-matchable queries. Brave's independent index, six search modalities, and predictable pricing make it the default general-purpose choice. [Read our full review](/reviews/brave-search-mcp-server/).

**"Find companies doing X" / "Research the landscape of Y"**
→ **Exa.** Conceptual, exploratory queries where you don't know the exact terms. Exa's semantic search finds results keyword engines miss. The `web_search_advanced_exa` tool covers company research, people search, and specialized categories through a single unified interface. [Read our full review](/reviews/exa-mcp-server/).

**"Build a RAG pipeline with LangChain/LlamaIndex"**
→ **Tavily.** Native framework integration means less glue code. The crawl and extract tools help with content ingestion. But watch the Nebius acquisition — the roadmap may shift.

**"Answer this question for me"**
→ **[Perplexity](/reviews/perplexity-mcp-server/) (4/5).** Skip the "search, read, extract" pipeline entirely. Get a synthesized answer with citations. The reasoning tool is unique for logic-heavy queries. Best when your agent needs facts, not research. [Read our full review](/reviews/perplexity-mcp-server/).

**"I want the highest-quality, ad-free results"**
→ **Kagi.** If you're already a Kagi subscriber and can get API access, the quality is genuinely excellent. But the closed beta, high cost, and minimal tooling make this impractical for most users today.

### The Two-Server Strategy

Most serious agent setups benefit from pairing two search servers:

1. **Brave + Exa** — Keyword search for specific lookups + semantic search for research. Covers both paradigms with no overlap. This is our recommended default pair.

2. **Brave + [Perplexity](/reviews/perplexity-mcp-server/)** — Keyword search for raw results + answer engine for quick facts. Good for agents that mix research with direct question-answering.

3. **Tavily + Exa** — RAG pipeline search + semantic research. Best for LangChain/LlamaIndex projects that also need deep research capabilities.

Running a single search server works fine for simple agents. But if your agent does both "look up X" and "research Y," one server won't cover both well.

## Decision Flowchart

```
Need search for an AI agent?
│
├─ Specific lookups (docs, facts, versions)?
│  └─ Brave Search (4/5) — best general-purpose
│
├─ Research & exploration (find companies, analyze trends)?
│  └─ Exa (4/5) — best semantic search
│
├─ Building a RAG pipeline with LangChain/LlamaIndex?
│  └─ Tavily (4/5) — best framework integration
│
├─ Just need quick answers with citations?
│  └─ Perplexity (4/5) — best answer engine
│
├─ Privacy-first, ad-free, cost is no object?
│  └─ Kagi — best quality (if you can get API access)
│
└─ Need both lookups AND research?
   └─ Brave + Exa — the recommended pair
```

## What's Missing from the Ecosystem

A few gaps worth noting:

1. **No Google Search MCP.** The most-used search engine in the world has no official MCP integration. Community wrappers exist but are fragile (scraping-based) or expensive (SerpAPI at $50/month for 5K searches). This gap will likely close as Google expands its MCP support.

2. **No open-source, self-hosted option.** Every search MCP server listed here requires an API key to a commercial service. There's no "run your own search index" MCP server. SearXNG (meta-search) is the closest self-hosted option but has no official MCP server.

3. **No unified multi-engine search.** No MCP server queries multiple search engines and deduplicates/merges results. This would be valuable for agents that need comprehensive coverage.

4. **Limited search analytics.** None of these servers report query costs, rate limit status, or usage metrics back to the agent. Your agent can burn through API credits without knowing it.
