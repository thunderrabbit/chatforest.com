Vector databases are the infrastructure behind RAG, semantic search, and AI memory — and every major vendor now has an MCP server. The problem: they're all at different stages of maturity, with wildly different approaches to what "vector database MCP" even means.

Some give you full collection management. Others give you two tools and call it done. Some only work with their own cloud service. Others run locally with zero infrastructure. The right choice depends on what you're actually trying to do — and whether the MCP server can keep up with the database behind it.

We've [reviewed Chroma](/reviews/chroma-mcp-server/) (3.5/5), [Qdrant](/reviews/qdrant-mcp-server/) (3/5), and [Pinecone](/reviews/pinecone-mcp-server/) (3/5) in depth. Here's how every vector database MCP server compares.

## The Contenders

| Server | Stars | Tools | Transport | Best For |
|--------|-------|-------|-----------|----------|
| [Chroma MCP](/reviews/chroma-mcp-server/) | 515 | 13 | stdio | Full vector DB management |
| [Qdrant MCP](/reviews/qdrant-mcp-server/) | 1,300 | 2 | stdio, SSE, Streamable HTTP | Semantic memory layer |
| [Pinecone MCP](/reviews/pinecone-mcp-server/) | 56 | 9 | stdio | Cloud vector search with reranking |
| Milvus MCP (Zilliz) | 220 | 12 | stdio, SSE | Self-hosted vector operations |
| Zilliz Cloud MCP | 32 | 16 | stdio, Streamable HTTP | Managed Milvus with cloud controls |
| Weaviate MCP | 161 | 2 | stdio | Nothing yet (proof of concept) |
| LanceDB MCP | 23 | 3 | stdio | Nothing yet (reference only) |

## Two Philosophies, One Category

The vector database MCP space splits into two camps, and understanding the divide saves you from picking the wrong server.

**Database management servers** give your agent full control: create collections, configure indexes, insert documents, query, update, delete. Chroma (13 tools) and Milvus (12 tools) take this approach. Your agent can build and manage vector infrastructure from scratch.

**Semantic memory servers** hide the database entirely. Your agent stores text and retrieves it by meaning. Qdrant (2 tools) is the purest version of this — there's no collection management, no index configuration, no delete. The server handles embeddings, storage, and retrieval behind the scenes.

Pinecone (9 tools) sits between the two. You can list and describe indexes, but creation is limited to Pinecone's integrated embedding models. The focus is on search quality — cascading search across indexes, built-in reranking — not infrastructure management.

Which philosophy you want depends on your use case. Building a RAG pipeline that needs careful tuning? You want database management. Adding persistent memory to a coding agent? Semantic memory is simpler and sufficient.

## The Reviewed Servers

### Chroma MCP — Most Comprehensive (3.5/5)

**[Read our full review](/reviews/chroma-mcp-server/)**

[Chroma's official MCP server](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma-mcp) has 13 tools — more than any other vector database MCP server. Eight handle collection management (create, list, peek, fork, modify, delete), five handle document operations (add, query, get, update, delete). It's the only server that lets your agent configure HNSW index parameters at collection creation time.

**What sets it apart:**
- Four deployment modes: ephemeral (in-memory), persistent (local files), self-hosted HTTP, and Chroma Cloud
- Six embedding providers: Default, Cohere, OpenAI, Jina, VoyageAI, Roboflow
- `chroma_fork_collection` — duplicate collections for safe experimentation
- Combined semantic + full-text + regex search through a single `query_documents` tool

**The catch:** Stdio-only transport means no remote MCP connections. Python-only. Still in beta with no releases in seven months. Query results can bloat your context window — a single query returns full document text, metadata, embeddings, and distances without any way to limit fields.

**Best for:** Developers who need full vector database management through their agent and are comfortable with local Python tooling.

### Qdrant MCP — Most Adopted (3/5)

**[Read our full review](/reviews/qdrant-mcp-server/)**

[Qdrant's official MCP server](https://github.com/qdrant/mcp-server-qdrant) takes the opposite approach from Chroma. Two tools: `qdrant-store` and `qdrant-find`. That's it. No collection management, no document updates, no deletes, no index tuning.

**What sets it apart:**
- Only vector DB MCP server supporting all three transports: stdio, SSE, and Streamable HTTP
- Local embedded mode via `QDRANT_LOCAL_PATH` — zero infrastructure semantic memory
- Extensible `QdrantMCPServer` class for building custom servers on top
- Customizable tool descriptions via environment variables
- 1,300 GitHub stars and 239 forks — most adopted by far

**The catch:** Two tools is genuinely limiting. You can't delete stored information (open issues [#74](https://github.com/qdrant/mcp-server-qdrant/issues/74) and [#101](https://github.com/qdrant/mcp-server-qdrant/issues/101)). No collection management means you can't organize information by project or topic through the MCP interface. FastEmbed-only embedding by default.

**Best for:** Adding persistent semantic memory to coding agents. Not for managing vector infrastructure.

### Pinecone MCP — Best Search Quality (3/5)

**[Read our full review](/reviews/pinecone-mcp-server/)**

[Pinecone's official Developer MCP server](https://github.com/pinecone-io/pinecone-mcp) (56 stars, v0.2.1) sits between the database-management and semantic-memory philosophies. Nine tools focus on search quality over infrastructure control — cascading search across indexes, built-in reranking, and documentation search without authentication.

**What sets it apart:**
- `cascading-search` — the only vector DB MCP server with cross-index search and automatic deduplication
- `rerank-documents` — built-in reranking using Pinecone's specialized models
- `search-docs` — query Pinecone documentation without an API key (like Stripe's doc search)
- Integrated embedding means zero embedding configuration — pass text, Pinecone handles the rest

**The catch:** Cloud-only with no local mode. Only works with integrated embedding indexes — existing indexes with custom embeddings (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) are invisible to the server. No delete, no update, no namespace management. Stdio transport for a cloud-only service. Three separate Pinecone MCP servers (Developer, Assistant, Claude Code Plugin) create confusion.

**Best for:** Pinecone users with integrated embedding indexes who want AI-assisted search with reranking and cross-index queries.

## The Unreviewed Servers

### Milvus MCP — Most Complete Self-Hosted

[Zilliz's Milvus MCP server](https://github.com/zilliztech/mcp-server-milvus) (220 stars) is the most capable self-hosted vector database MCP server. Twelve tools covering everything from collection creation to hybrid search:

**Search tools (5):**
- `milvus_text_search` — full-text search
- `milvus_vector_search` — vector similarity search
- `milvus_hybrid_search` — combined text + vector search
- `milvus_text_similarity_search` — text similarity (requires Milvus 2.6.0+)
- `milvus_query` — filtered queries with expressions

**Management tools (7):**
- Collection CRUD: list, create, get info, load, release
- `milvus_insert_data` — insert records
- `milvus_delete_entities` — delete by filter expression

**What it offers:**
- Stdio and SSE transport
- Works with self-hosted Milvus or Zilliz Cloud
- Full delete capability (unlike Qdrant)
- Hybrid search combining dense vectors with full-text search

**The catch:** Python-only. No versioned releases (35 commits, last updated December 2025). Requires a running Milvus instance — no embedded/local mode. Authentication is optional, which is good for development but concerning for production.

Zilliz also maintains a separate [Zilliz Cloud MCP server](https://github.com/zilliztech/zilliz-mcp-server) (32 stars, 16 tools) that adds cloud management — cluster creation, suspension, metrics — plus Streamable HTTP transport. Early stage (3 commits) but shows where the platform is heading.

**Best for:** Teams already running Milvus who want full database management through MCP.

### Weaviate MCP — Too Early

[Weaviate's official MCP server](https://github.com/weaviate/mcp-server-weaviate) (161 stars) has two tools: `insert_one` and `query`. One commit. No releases. Written in Go, which is unusual for MCP servers. The README shows placeholder JSON examples.

Despite 161 GitHub stars (likely from Weaviate's brand recognition), this is a proof of concept, not a usable server. The community [sajal2692/mcp-weaviate](https://github.com/sajal2692/mcp-weaviate) alternative has 11 tools and is more functional, but has minimal adoption.

**Best for:** Nothing yet. Wait for Weaviate to invest in this properly.

### LanceDB MCP — Reference Only

[LanceDB's official MCP server](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb-mcp-server) (23 stars) has three tools: `ingest_docs`, `retrieve_docs`, and `get_table_details`. Three commits. No releases. Explicitly described as a reference implementation.

LanceDB itself is excellent — embedded, serverless, multimodal, Rust-powered — but the MCP tooling is the weakest in this comparison. There's an [open issue](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb/issues/2341) requesting a more capable server with full CRUD tools.

**Best for:** Nothing yet. The database deserves better MCP support than it currently has.

## The pgvector Gap

Notably absent from this comparison: a dedicated pgvector MCP server. PostgreSQL's vector extension is one of the most popular ways to add vector search to existing applications, but there's no clear winner in the MCP space.

The options are fragmented: [yusuf/mcp-pgvector-server](https://lobehub.com/mcp/yusuf-mcp-pgvector-server) for dedicated pgvector search, [neverinfamous/postgres-mcp](https://github.com/neverinfamous/postgres-mcp) for full Postgres with pgvector as one of many supported extensions, and [Knuckles-Team/vector-mcp](https://github.com/Knuckles-Team/vector-mcp) (9 stars) as a multi-database MCP supporting pgvector alongside ChromaDB, Qdrant, and MongoDB.

If you're already using PostgreSQL with pgvector, your best option today is a general Postgres MCP server rather than a dedicated vector database MCP server. This gap will likely close as the ecosystem matures.

## Our Recommendations

### For full vector database management: Chroma MCP

If you need your agent to create collections, configure indexes, manage documents, and run queries — Chroma is the only server that covers the full lifecycle. Thirteen tools, four deployment modes, six embedding providers. The stdio-only transport and stalling development are real concerns, but nothing else comes close on capability.

### For semantic memory: Qdrant MCP

If you want to add persistent memory to a coding agent without thinking about vector infrastructure, Qdrant's two-tool approach is the right abstraction. Store text, find it later by meaning. The broadest transport support (stdio, SSE, Streamable HTTP) means it works in more deployment scenarios than any competitor. Just accept that you can't delete anything yet.

### For search quality: [Pinecone MCP](/reviews/pinecone-mcp-server/)

If search quality matters more than flexibility — cascading search across indexes, built-in reranking, integrated embeddings — Pinecone's server is purpose-built for this. The limitation to Pinecone's integrated embedding models is significant, but if you're starting fresh on Pinecone, the search experience is the best in the category.

### For self-hosted infrastructure: Milvus MCP

If you're running Milvus and need full management through MCP — collections, inserts, deletes, hybrid search — the Milvus server has the best self-hosted story. Twelve tools with both stdio and SSE transport. The lack of versioned releases is a concern, but the tool coverage is solid.

### For everything else: Wait

Weaviate and LanceDB both have MCP servers that aren't ready for real use. If you're committed to either database, use their native SDKs and check back in six months. The community alternatives are more functional but lack the maintenance guarantees of first-party servers.

## Decision Flowchart

**What's your primary use case?**

→ **Adding memory to a coding agent?** Use [Qdrant MCP](/reviews/qdrant-mcp-server/) for the simplest path, or [Chroma MCP](/reviews/chroma-mcp-server/) if you need to organize memories into collections.

→ **Building a RAG pipeline?** Use [Chroma MCP](/reviews/chroma-mcp-server/) for local development with full collection management, or [Pinecone MCP](/reviews/pinecone-mcp-server/) for cloud deployment with reranking.

→ **Managing existing vector infrastructure?** Match the server to your database: Milvus MCP for Milvus, [Pinecone MCP](/reviews/pinecone-mcp-server/) for Pinecone (integrated embeddings only), Qdrant MCP for Qdrant. Chroma MCP covers Chroma across all four deployment modes.

→ **Need remote MCP (not stdio)?** [Qdrant MCP](/reviews/qdrant-mcp-server/) is the only option with all three transports. Milvus has SSE. Zilliz Cloud MCP has Streamable HTTP. Everyone else is stdio-only.

→ **Need zero infrastructure?** [Qdrant MCP](/reviews/qdrant-mcp-server/) with `QDRANT_LOCAL_PATH` or [Chroma MCP](/reviews/chroma-mcp-server/) in persistent mode — both run embedded without a separate server process.

## The Bottom Line

The vector database MCP space is young. Even the best server here — Chroma at 3.5/5 — has significant gaps (no remote transport, stalling development). The most adopted server — Qdrant at 1,300 stars — has just two tools. No server in this category supports OAuth authentication. None have reached 1.0.

But the trajectory is clear. Every major vector database vendor has planted a flag in the MCP ecosystem. The servers that invest in tool coverage, transport flexibility, and developer experience will pull ahead. Right now, Chroma leads on capability, Qdrant leads on simplicity and reach, Pinecone leads on search quality, and Milvus leads on self-hosted breadth.

Pick the server that matches your database. If you don't have a database yet and want the most capable MCP experience, start with [Chroma](/reviews/chroma-mcp-server/). If you just want semantic memory with zero friction, start with [Qdrant](/reviews/qdrant-mcp-server/).
