Project management is where AI agents deliver the most obvious productivity gains. Creating issues, searching backlogs, updating sprints, linking PRs to tickets — these are the repetitive tasks that eat hours every week. MCP servers turn them into natural-language commands inside your IDE or chat interface.

The good news: this category has strong official support. Atlassian, Linear, Monday.com, and Notion all ship their own MCP servers. The community has filled in the rest. The result is a mature, competitive landscape with real choices.

We've researched 40+ project management MCP servers across every major platform. This guide covers what's worth using, what to avoid, and where the ecosystem still has gaps.

*Note: Our recommendations are based on documentation review, GitHub analysis, and community feedback — not hands-on testing of every server. Star counts were verified in March 2026.*

## Why project management MCP servers matter

Every development team has the same friction: context-switching between their IDE and their issue tracker. Write code, tab to Jira, update the ticket, tab back. Repeat fifty times a day. MCP servers eliminate that loop.

The value comes in three forms:

1. **Issue management from your editor.** "Create a bug ticket for the login timeout in the Auth project, assign to me, set to High priority" — without leaving your IDE. The agent creates the issue with the right fields, labels, and sprint assignment.
2. **Backlog search and triage.** "Show me all unresolved bugs in the Payments project from the last sprint" — agents translate natural language into JQL, Linear filters, or API queries and return structured results.
3. **Cross-tool workflows.** "When I commit this PR, update the linked Jira ticket to In Review and add a comment with the PR link" — connecting your version control workflow directly to your project tracker.

The landscape splits into three tiers: **platforms with official MCP servers** (Atlassian, Linear, Monday.com, Notion), **platforms with strong community servers** (Asana, ClickUp, Trello, Todoist), and **legacy/enterprise tools with emerging support** (Redmine, Basecamp, Wrike, Shortcut).

## Jira / Atlassian servers

Jira dominates enterprise project management, and its MCP ecosystem reflects that — more implementations than any other platform, plus an official remote server from Atlassian.

### The community winner: sooperset/mcp-atlassian

**Stars:** 4,600 | **Language:** Python | **License:** MIT | **Tools:** 72

[sooperset/mcp-atlassian](https://github.com/sooperset/mcp-atlassian) is the most adopted Atlassian MCP server by a wide margin. It covers both Jira and Confluence, supports Cloud and Server/Data Center deployments, and provides 72 tools spanning issue CRUD, sprint management, board operations, JQL search, page creation, and more.

**Why it wins:** Massive adoption (4,600+ stars), dual Jira+Confluence coverage, and support for both Cloud and on-prem deployments. Recent updates (v0.21.0, March 2026) added page movement, version diff comparisons, comment replies, and page width layout controls.

**The catch:** As a local server, you manage authentication and updates yourself. The official Atlassian remote server handles this automatically.

**Best for:** Teams on Jira Cloud or Data Center who want comprehensive Jira+Confluence access from their AI assistant.

### The official option: Atlassian Rovo MCP Server

**Type:** Remote (cloud-hosted) | **Auth:** OAuth | **Platforms:** Jira, Confluence, Compass

[Atlassian's Rovo MCP Server](https://github.com/atlassian/atlassian-mcp-server) is the official, cloud-hosted MCP gateway. It went GA in early 2026 and supports a broad set of AI clients including Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, VS Code, GitHub Copilot, and more.

**Why it matters:** Zero local setup. OAuth authentication. Atlassian maintains it. Supports both read and write operations — search issues, create epics, update pages, and link content across Jira and Confluence.

**The catch:** Cloud-only (no Data Center/Server support). Requires Atlassian Cloud subscription. The SSE endpoint (`/v1/sse`) is being deprecated June 30, 2026 — update to `/v1/mcp`.

**Best for:** Teams already on Atlassian Cloud who want a zero-maintenance, officially supported integration.

### Also notable

**[xuanxt/atlassian-mcp](https://github.com/xuanxt/atlassian-mcp)** — 51 tools for Confluence and Jira Cloud. Supports NPM and Docker deployment. Good middle ground between sooperset's comprehensive approach and simpler alternatives.

**[aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-jira](https://github.com/aashari/mcp-server-atlassian-jira)** (60 stars, TypeScript, MIT) — Node.js/TypeScript server with a unique approach: v3.0 replaced 8+ specific tools with 5 generic HTTP method tools that can access any Jira API endpoint. Uses TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) format that reduces token usage by 30-60%.

**[nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp](https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp)** — Go-based MCP connector. Lightweight, fast, and covers issue management, sprint planning, and workflow transitions. Good choice for Go shops.

**[b1ff/atlassian-dc-mcp](https://github.com/b1ff/atlassian-dc-mcp)** — Specifically built for Data Center deployments. Covers Bitbucket, Confluence, and Jira. If you're on DC and can't use the official Cloud server, this is purpose-built for you.

---

## Linear servers

Linear's clean API and developer-friendly culture made it an early MCP adopter. The official remote server is now the recommended option.

### The winner: Linear Official MCP Server

**Type:** Remote (cloud-hosted) | **Auth:** OAuth | **Endpoint:** `https://mcp.linear.app/sse`

Linear ships an official remote MCP server that supports initiatives, project milestones, updates, issue management, and team operations. It's the recommended option after the popular community server (jerhadf) was deprecated.

**Why it wins:** Official support, always up-to-date with Linear's API, zero local setup. Covers the full Linear workflow: issues, projects, cycles, labels, teams, and milestones.

**The catch:** Remote-only — requires internet connectivity. No self-hosted option for air-gapped environments.

**Best for:** Any team using Linear who wants AI-powered issue management.

### The legacy option: jerhadf/linear-mcp-server

**Stars:** 329 | **Language:** TypeScript | **License:** MIT

[jerhadf/linear-mcp-server](https://github.com/jerhadf/linear-mcp-server) was the original community Linear MCP server. It provides tools for creating, updating, searching, and commenting on issues with flexible filtering.

**Important:** This server is deprecated. The README directs users to the official Linear remote MCP server. Still useful as a reference implementation, but don't build new workflows on it.

### Also notable

**[tacticlaunch/mcp-linear](https://github.com/tacticlaunch/mcp-linear)** — Enables AI assistants to interact with Linear through natural language for retrieving, creating, and updating issues, projects, and teams. Active alternative if you prefer a local server.

## Notion servers

Notion blurs the line between project management, wiki, and database. Its MCP ecosystem reflects that versatility, with both official and community servers.

### The winner: makenotion/notion-mcp-server

**Stars:** 3,700 | **Language:** TypeScript | **License:** MIT

[makenotion/notion-mcp-server](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-mcp-server) is the official Notion MCP server. Version 2.0.0 migrated to the Notion API 2025-09-03, which introduced data sources as the primary abstraction for databases. Features OAuth for easy setup, Markdown page editing, and tools designed for optimized token consumption.

**Why it wins:** Official, high adoption (3,700+ stars), and purpose-built for AI agents with token-efficient responses.

**Stars:** 778 | **Language:** TypeScript | **License:** MIT

[suekou/mcp-notion-server](https://github.com/suekou/mcp-notion-server) takes a different approach: it converts Notion content to Markdown to reduce context size when communicating with LLMs. This makes it more token-efficient for large Notion workspaces.

**Why it's notable:** Markdown conversion means lower token costs and faster responses. Good for teams with large Notion databases.

**Best for:** Cost-conscious teams with extensive Notion content.

### Also notable

**[awkoy/notion-mcp-server](https://github.com/awkoy/notion-mcp-server)** — Production-ready community server with a complete set of tools and endpoints for reading, creating, and modifying Notion content. Active development.

## Asana servers

Asana lacks an official MCP server, but the community has built a solid option.

### The winner: roychri/mcp-server-asana

**Stars:** 129 | **Language:** TypeScript | **License:** MIT

[roychri/mcp-server-asana](https://github.com/roychri/mcp-server-asana) is the most established Asana MCP server. It covers tasks, projects, workspaces, and comments through Asana's API. Includes a READ_ONLY_MODE toggle to disable all write operations during testing.

**Why it wins:** Most adopted Asana MCP server. Covers the core Asana workflow. The read-only mode is a smart safety feature for evaluating the server before granting write access.

**The catch:** Community-maintained, not official. Feature coverage may lag behind Asana's API updates.

**Best for:** Asana teams who want AI-powered task management with a safety net.

---

## Which server should you choose?

Follow this decision tree:

1. **Using Jira Cloud?** → Start with the [official Atlassian Rovo MCP Server](https://github.com/atlassian/atlassian-mcp-server). If you need Confluence too or want more tools, add [sooperset/mcp-atlassian](https://github.com/sooperset/mcp-atlassian).
2. **Using Jira Data Center/Server?** → [sooperset/mcp-atlassian](https://github.com/sooperset/mcp-atlassian) (supports both Cloud and DC) or [b1ff/atlassian-dc-mcp](https://github.com/b1ff/atlassian-dc-mcp) (DC-specific).
3. **Using Linear?** → [Linear Official MCP](https://mcp.linear.app). No contest.
4. **Using Notion?** → [makenotion/notion-mcp-server](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-mcp-server) for official support. [suekou/mcp-notion-server](https://github.com/suekou/mcp-notion-server) for better token efficiency.
5. **Using Monday.com?** → [mondaycom/mcp](https://github.com/mondaycom/mcp). Official and comprehensive.
6. **Using Asana?** → [roychri/mcp-server-asana](https://github.com/roychri/mcp-server-asana). Only strong option.
7. **Using ClickUp?** → [taazkareem/clickup-mcp-server](https://github.com/taazkareem/clickup-mcp-server) if budget allows, otherwise [hauptsacheNet/clickup-mcp](https://github.com/hauptsacheNet/clickup-mcp).
8. **Using multiple tools?** → Consider Composio or Merge for unified access.

---

## Three trends to watch

**1. Official servers are winning.** Atlassian, Linear, Monday.com, Notion, and Todoist all ship their own MCP servers. This is a clear industry signal: platform vendors see MCP as a first-class integration surface. Expect more official servers in 2026.

**2. Remote MCP is the future.** The shift from local servers to cloud-hosted remote MCP servers (Atlassian Rovo, Linear's hosted endpoint) simplifies setup and eliminates authentication headaches. The trade-off is internet dependency and less customization.

**3. The ClickUp model may spread.** taazkareem's transition from open-source to paid licensing is notable. As MCP servers become critical infrastructure, expect more maintainers to explore sustainable business models. This could improve quality but reduce free options.

---

## What's still missing

Despite strong coverage, several gaps remain in the project management MCP ecosystem:

- **Asana has no official MCP server.** Given its market position, this is a surprising gap. The community server works, but official support would be a significant upgrade.
- **No Basecamp MCP server with traction.** Basecamp has API support but no community MCP server with meaningful adoption.
- **Wrike and Smartsheet are underserved.** Enterprise-popular tools with minimal MCP representation.
- **No cross-platform migration tools.** Nothing helps you move issues between Jira and Linear, or sync projects across platforms, via MCP.
- **GitLab Issues MCP is fragmented.** GitLab's issue tracker is widely used but MCP support is scattered across generic GitLab servers rather than purpose-built project management tools.
- **No Shortcut (formerly Clubhouse) server with adoption.** Despite its popularity with engineering teams, MCP support is minimal.
