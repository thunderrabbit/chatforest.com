When Anthropic open-sourced the Model Context Protocol in November 2024, AI frameworks faced a choice: build proprietary tool ecosystems or adopt a shared standard. By early 2026, the answer is clear — every major AI framework now supports MCP, creating a universal tool layer where a server built for one framework works with all of them.

This isn't just theoretical interoperability. A filesystem MCP server originally built for Claude Desktop works unchanged with LangChain agents, CrewAI crews, LlamaIndex workflows, Spring AI applications, and Vercel AI SDK chatbots. The MCP specification's transport-agnostic design means frameworks can connect via stdio for local servers or Streamable HTTP for remote ones, without framework-specific adapters on the server side.

This guide covers MCP integration across 12+ AI frameworks with package details, code examples, transport support, and architectural patterns. Our analysis draws on official documentation, SDK source code, PyPI/npm release data, and community reports — we research and analyze rather than deploying these systems ourselves.

## The Framework Landscape at a Glance

Before diving into each framework, here's where MCP integration stands across the ecosystem:

| Framework | MCP Package | Version | Transports | Multi-Server | Bidirectional | Language |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LangChain / LangGraph** | `langchain-mcp-adapters` | 0.2.2 | stdio, SSE, HTTP, Streamable HTTP | Yes | Yes (Agent Server) | Python, JS/TS |
| **CrewAI** | Built-in + `crewai-tools[mcp]` | — | stdio, SSE, HTTP, Streamable HTTP | Yes | Community | Python |
| **LlamaIndex** | `llama-index-tools-mcp` | 0.4.8 | stdio, SSE, Streamable HTTP | Yes | Yes (`workflow_as_mcp`) | Python |
| **Vercel AI SDK** | `@ai-sdk/mcp` | Stable (SDK 6) | stdio, SSE, HTTP | Yes | No | JS/TS |
| **Mastra** | Built-in | — | HTTP, stdio (npx) | Yes | Yes | TypeScript |
| **PydanticAI** | Built-in | — | stdio, Streamable HTTP | Yes | No | Python |
| **DSPy** | Built-in | — | stdio, SSE | Yes | No | Python |
| **Haystack** | `mcp-haystack` | — | Streamable HTTP, stdio | Yes | Yes (Hayhooks) | Python |
| **Spring AI** | `spring-ai-starter-mcp-client` | 1.1+ | stdio, SSE, Streamable HTTP | Yes | Yes | Java |
| **Semantic Kernel** | `ModelContextProtocol` NuGet | — | stdio | Yes | Yes (Agent Framework) | C# / .NET |
| **AutoGen / AG2** | `autogen-ext-mcp` | — | stdio, SSE | Yes | Yes (AgentOS) | Python |
| **Composio** | Framework-agnostic gateway | — | All | Yes | Yes | Python, JS/TS |

**Key patterns emerging**: Streamable HTTP is replacing SSE as the preferred remote transport. Bidirectional support — frameworks both consuming and exposing MCP — is increasingly common. And multi-server support is now table stakes.

## LangChain: The langchain-mcp-adapters Package

LangChain's MCP integration lives in the [`langchain-mcp-adapters`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-mcp-adapters) package, one of the most mature MCP framework adapters in the ecosystem. First released on February 18, 2025, it has shipped 28 versions through March 2026, evolving from basic tool conversion to a full-featured MCP client with interceptors, elicitation, and multimodal support.

### Installation and Basic Usage

```bash
pip install langchain-mcp-adapters
```

The core function is `load_mcp_tools()`, which connects to an MCP server and converts its tools into LangChain `StructuredTool` instances:

```python
from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client
from langchain_mcp_adapters.tools import load_mcp_tools

server_params = StdioServerParameters(
    command="npx",
    args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/tmp"]
)

async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):
    async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
        await session.initialize()
        tools = await load_mcp_tools(session)
        # tools is now a list of LangChain StructuredTool instances
```

Each tool preserves the MCP server's name, description, and JSON Schema parameters, so LLMs see the same interface regardless of whether the tool came from MCP or was defined natively in LangChain.

### Multi-Server Support

Real-world agents need tools from multiple servers. The `MultiServerMCPClient` class manages connections to several MCP servers simultaneously:

```python
from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient

async with MultiServerMCPClient({
    "filesystem": {
        "transport": "stdio",
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/tmp"]
    },
    "weather": {
        "transport": "http",
        "url": "https://weather-mcp.example.com/mcp"
    },
    "database": {
        "transport": "sse",
        "url": "http://localhost:3001/sse",
        "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer token123"}
    }
}) as client:
    tools = await client.get_tools()
    # All tools from all servers, ready for an agent
```

Each server connection is configured independently with its transport type and connection parameters. HTTP transports support custom headers for authentication and tracing.

### Beyond Tools: Resources and Prompts

The adapter supports the full MCP capability surface, not just tools:

- **Resources**: `client.get_resources()` retrieves data from MCP servers as blob objects — useful for accessing files, database schemas, or other contextual data
- **Prompts**: `client.get_prompt("server_name", "prompt_name")` fetches prompt templates defined by MCP servers

### Advanced Features

The 0.2.x series introduced several powerful capabilities:

**Tool interceptors** provide a middleware pattern for request/response modification:

```python
from langchain_mcp_adapters.tools import load_mcp_tools

async def audit_interceptor(request, context, next_handler):
    # Log every tool call
    print(f"Tool {request.params.name} called with {request.params.arguments}")
    result = await next_handler(request)
    return result

tools = await load_mcp_tools(session, interceptors=[audit_interceptor])
```

Interceptors can access runtime context including user data, API keys, agent state, and memory store. They can also return `Command` objects to control agent flow, including early termination.

**Elicitation** allows MCP servers to request additional user input during tool execution, with accept/decline/cancel handling on the client side.

**Multimodal responses** convert images, text, and other content types from MCP tool results into LangChain content blocks, preserving rich output from tools that return more than plain text.

**Stateful sessions** maintain context across multiple tool calls to the same server:

```python
async with client.session("database") as session:
    # Multiple calls share the same session state
    await session.call_tool("connect", {"database": "mydb"})
    result = await session.call_tool("query", {"sql": "SELECT * FROM users"})
```

### JavaScript / TypeScript

The JavaScript counterpart lives in the LangChain.js monorepo as [`@langchain/mcp-adapters`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/mcp-adapters) (v0.6.0). It provides the same multi-server client, stdio and SSE transport support, custom headers, and reconnection strategies, targeting Node.js and edge runtime environments.

## LangGraph: Agents with MCP Tools

[LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) doesn't have a separate MCP package — it uses `langchain-mcp-adapters` directly. MCP tools loaded via `MultiServerMCPClient` integrate with LangGraph's `StateGraph`, `bind_tools()`, and `ToolNode` components just like native LangChain tools.

### Using MCP Tools in LangGraph Agents

```python
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")

async with MultiServerMCPClient({
    "filesystem": {
        "transport": "stdio",
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/tmp"]
    }
}) as client:
    tools = await client.get_tools()
    agent = create_react_agent(model, tools)
    result = await agent.ainvoke({"messages": [("user", "List files in /tmp")]})
```

The tools behave identically to native LangGraph tools — they appear in the graph's tool node, participate in the agent loop, and their results feed back into the LLM's context.

### Tool Interceptors in LangGraph

Interceptors become particularly powerful within LangGraph because they can access `ToolRuntime` context — including tool call IDs, agent state, configuration, and memory store. An interceptor can even return a `Command` object to update graph state or redirect flow:

```python
async def auth_interceptor(request, context, next_handler):
    # Access the current user from LangGraph state
    user = context.state.get("current_user")
    if not user:
        from langgraph.types import Command
        return Command(goto="__end__", update={"error": "Not authenticated"})
    return await next_handler(request)
```

### LangGraph Agent Server: Exposing Agents as MCP Servers

The bidirectional story is where LangGraph's MCP integration gets particularly interesting. The **LangGraph Agent Server** (langgraph-api >= 0.2.3) can expose LangGraph agents as MCP tools via a `/mcp` endpoint using Streamable HTTP.

Any agent configured in `langgraph.json` automatically becomes available as an MCP tool. The tool's name, description, and input schema derive from the agent configuration. This means a LangGraph agent can be consumed by Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, or any other MCP client — without writing any additional integration code.

The Agent Server supports a three-tier tool architecture:
1. **Built-in LangChain tools** — native tool definitions
2. **Remote MCP servers** — over HTTP or SSE
3. **Local MCP servers** — via stdio subprocess

This creates a composable architecture where LangGraph agents can consume tools from MCP servers while simultaneously being exposed as MCP servers themselves.

### LangSmith: Observability for MCP

[LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith) complements the LangChain/LangGraph MCP story with observability. LangSmith's tracing automatically captures MCP tool calls made through LangChain agents as standard trace spans, including tool names, inputs, outputs, and latency.

LangSmith also provides its own **LangSmith MCP Server** that exposes workspace data — prompts, traces, datasets, and experiments — via MCP. Configure it in Claude Desktop or any MCP client to query your LangSmith workspace conversationally.

## CrewAI: Native MCP DSL

[CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) takes a distinctive approach to MCP integration by building it directly into the agent DSL, making MCP servers feel like a native part of crew definitions rather than an adapter pattern.

### Simple DSL (Recommended)

The simplest approach sets `mcps` directly on agents with string URLs:

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

researcher = Agent(
    role="Research Analyst",
    goal="Find and analyze data",
    mcps=["https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp?api_key=YOUR_KEY"]
)

# Target specific tools from a server
writer = Agent(
    role="Writer",
    goal="Write articles",
    mcps=["https://api.weather.com/mcp#get_forecast"]
)

crew = Crew(agents=[researcher, writer], tasks=[...])
```

The `#tool_name` fragment syntax lets you cherry-pick specific tools from multi-tool servers, avoiding tool sprawl that can confuse LLMs.

### MCPServerAdapter (Advanced)

For more control, use the adapter with explicit transport configuration:

```python
from crewai_tools.mcp import MCPServerAdapter, MCPServerStdio

server = MCPServerStdio(command="npx", args=["-y", "server-filesystem", "/tmp"])

async with MCPServerAdapter(server) as tools:
    agent = Agent(
        role="File Manager",
        tools=tools,
        goal="Manage files"
    )
```

`MCPServerStdio`, `MCPServerHTTP`, and `MCPServerSSE` transport classes provide fine-grained connection control.

### Key Features

- **Automatic tool discovery**: Agents enumerate available tools at connection time
- **Name collision prevention**: When multiple MCP servers expose tools with the same name, CrewAI prefixes them with the server identifier
- **On-demand connections**: Servers are connected only when their tools are actually needed during crew execution
- **Schema caching**: Tool schemas are cached to avoid redundant server queries
- **Static and dynamic tool filtering**: Control which tools agents can access

### Installation

```bash
uv add mcp              # For simple DSL
uv pip install 'crewai-tools[mcp]'  # For MCPServerAdapter
```

## LlamaIndex: Bidirectional MCP Integration

[LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/)'s MCP integration stands out for its bidirectional design — LlamaIndex can both consume MCP tools and expose its Workflows as MCP servers.

### Consuming MCP Tools

```python
from llama_index.tools.mcp import BasicMCPClient, McpToolSpec

# Connect to a remote MCP server
mcp_client = BasicMCPClient("http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse")
mcp_tool_spec = McpToolSpec(client=mcp_client)
tools = await mcp_tool_spec.to_tool_list_async()

# Use tools with any LlamaIndex agent
from llama_index.agent.openai import OpenAIAgent
agent = OpenAIAgent.from_tools(tools)
response = await agent.achat("What's the weather?")
```

**Package**: [`llama-index-tools-mcp`](https://pypi.org/project/llama-index-tools-mcp/) v0.4.8 (February 2026)

**Supported transports**: SSE, Streamable HTTP, stdio (local process)

**OAuth 2.0 support**: Authenticated MCP servers can use standard OAuth flows for token-based access.

### Exposing Workflows as MCP Servers

The `workflow_as_mcp` function converts any LlamaIndex Workflow into an MCP server:

```python
from llama_index.tools.mcp import workflow_as_mcp

# Your existing LlamaIndex workflow
my_workflow = MyRAGWorkflow()

# Expose it as an MCP server
mcp_server = workflow_as_mcp(my_workflow)
mcp_server.run()  # Now accessible to any MCP client
```

This bidirectional capability means you can build a RAG pipeline in LlamaIndex and make it available to Claude Desktop, LangChain agents, or any other MCP client without rewriting the pipeline.

## Vercel AI SDK: Stable MCP in SDK 6

The [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) graduated its MCP support from experimental to stable in **AI SDK 6**, available in the `@ai-sdk/mcp` package.

### Usage

```typescript
import { createMCPClient } from "@ai-sdk/mcp";
import { generateText } from "ai";

const mcpClient = await createMCPClient({
  transport: {
    type: "sse",
    url: "http://localhost:3001/sse",
  },
});

const tools = await mcpClient.tools();

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  tools,
  prompt: "What's the weather in Tokyo?",
});
```

Tools from `mcpClient.tools()` are directly compatible with `generateText` and `streamText`, the SDK's core text generation functions.

### SDK 6 Enhancements

- **OAuth authentication**: Full PKCE flow, token refresh, and dynamic client registration
- **Resources and prompts**: Access MCP resource data and prompt templates, not just tools
- **Elicitation**: Handle server requests for additional user input
- **Stable API**: `createMCPClient()` replaces the previous `experimental_createMCPClient`
- **Transports**: SSE, HTTP, and stdio

The Vercel AI SDK is client-only — it consumes MCP servers but doesn't expose applications as MCP servers.

## Mastra: Full MCP Client and Server

[Mastra](https://mastra.ai/), the TypeScript AI framework from the team behind Gatsby, provides both MCP client and server capabilities as built-in features.

### MCP Client

```typescript
import { MCPClient } from "@mastra/mcp";

const client = new MCPClient({
  servers: {
    filesystem: {
      command: "npx",
      args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/tmp"],
    },
    weather: {
      url: new URL("https://weather-mcp.example.com/mcp"),
    },
  },
});

const tools = await client.getTools();
```

### MCP Server

Mastra can expose its tools, agents, workflows, prompts, and resources to any MCP client:

```typescript
import { MCPServer } from "@mastra/mcp";

const server = new MCPServer({
  name: "my-agent-server",
  tools: myTools,
  agents: [myAgent],
  workflows: [myWorkflow],
});
```

The deep Next.js and Vercel integration makes Mastra particularly well-suited for web applications that need to expose AI capabilities via MCP.

## PydanticAI: Three Integration Paths

[PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) offers three distinct approaches to MCP integration, reflecting different architectural preferences:

1. **Direct MCP Client** via `MCPServer` class — the standard approach
2. **FastMCP Client** via `FastMCPToolset` — leveraging the FastMCP library
3. **Provider-level integration** via `MCPServerTool` — the provider connects to MCP natively

```python
from pydantic_ai_mcp import MCPServer

server = MCPServer("http://localhost:8000/mcp")
agent = Agent("openai:gpt-4o", mcp_servers=[server])
result = await agent.run("List available tools")
```

**Notable**: PydanticAI has explicitly **deprecated SSE transport** in favor of Streamable HTTP, making it one of the first frameworks to fully commit to the newer transport. This signals the direction the broader ecosystem is heading.

Supported transports: stdio and Streamable HTTP (SSE deprecated).

## DSPy: Declarative MCP Tools

[DSPy](https://dspy.ai/) integrates MCP tools into its declarative programming model:

```python
from dspy import Tool
from mcp import ClientSession

# Convert MCP tools to DSPy tools
tools = [Tool.from_mcp_tool(mcp_tool) for mcp_tool in mcp_tools]

# Use in ReAct framework
react = dspy.ReAct(signature, tools=tools)
```

DSPy's ReAct framework supports concurrent interaction with multiple MCP servers. MCP tools convert via `Tool.from_mcp_tool` and `convert_mcp_tool`, preserving schemas and descriptions. The integration is built into DSPy core rather than requiring a separate package.

## Haystack: Pipelines and Hayhooks

[Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/) by deepset integrates MCP through the `mcp-haystack` package:

```python
from mcp_haystack import MCPTool, StreamableHttpServerInfo

server = StreamableHttpServerInfo(url="http://localhost:8000/mcp")
tool = MCPTool(server_info=server, tool_name="search")

# Use in Haystack pipeline
pipeline.add_component("search_tool", tool)
```

The bidirectional story comes through **Hayhooks** — a single command can expose any Haystack pipeline as an MCP server, making it accessible to Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP client. This was announced in May 2025 and represents one of the earliest framework-to-MCP-server bridges.

## Spring AI: Enterprise Java MCP

[Spring AI](https://spring.io/projects/spring-ai) was an early MCP adopter in the Java ecosystem, shipping full MCP support with **Spring AI 1.1 GA** in November 2025. Spring was also a contributor to the official MCP Java SDK.

### Configuration

```yaml
spring:
  ai:
    mcp:
      client:
        stdio:
          servers:
            filesystem:
              command: npx
              args:
                - "-y"
                - "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"
                - "/tmp"
```

### Features

- **Boot starters**: `spring-ai-starter-mcp-client` for stdio and Servlet-based transports, `spring-ai-starter-mcp-client-webflux` for reactive applications
- **Annotation-driven**: Expose any Spring bean method as an MCP tool with a single annotation
- **YAML configuration**: Consume external MCP servers via standard Spring configuration
- **Based on MCP Java SDK v0.14**, protocol version 2025-06-18
- **Bidirectional**: Server starters let Spring AI applications expose their own MCP endpoints

Spring AI's MCP support targets enterprise Java teams who want to integrate AI tool use into existing Spring Boot applications without rewriting infrastructure.

## Microsoft Ecosystem: Semantic Kernel + AutoGen → Agent Framework

Microsoft's MCP story is in transition. **Semantic Kernel** and **AutoGen** both support MCP, but Microsoft is merging them into the unified **Microsoft Agent Framework** (RC 1.0 released February 19, 2026, GA targeted end of Q1 2026).

### Semantic Kernel MCP

Uses the `ModelContextProtocol` NuGet package to convert MCP tools to Semantic Kernel functions:

```csharp
var tools = await mcpClient.ListToolsAsync();
kernel.Plugins.AddFromFunctions("GitHub",
    tools.Select(t => t.AsKernelFunction()));
```

The `AsKernelFunction()` extension method (available since Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Core 1.44.0) handles the conversion from MCP tool schemas to SK function definitions.

### AutoGen / AG2

The `autogen-ext-mcp` PyPI package (released January 2025) bridges AutoGen tool calls to MCP requests. The community fork AG2 extends this with AgentOS, supporting both A2A (agent-to-agent) and MCP protocols.

As the Agent Framework reaches GA, expect a unified MCP integration surface that replaces the current Semantic Kernel and AutoGen approaches.

## Cross-Framework Patterns

Several architectural patterns emerge across the framework ecosystem:

### Pattern 1: Tool Conversion

Every framework follows the same basic pattern: connect to an MCP server, enumerate its tools, convert them to the framework's native tool type. The conversion preserves tool names, descriptions, and JSON Schema parameters so LLMs see a consistent interface.

```
MCP Server → MCP Client SDK → Framework Tool Adapter → Native Tool
```

This pattern means the framework-specific code is minimal — typically a thin wrapper that maps MCP's `CallToolResult` to the framework's expected return type.

### Pattern 2: Multi-Server Composition

Production agents rarely use a single tool server. Every major framework now supports connecting to multiple MCP servers simultaneously, with tools from all servers presented to the LLM in a unified tool list. Name collision handling varies — CrewAI prefixes server names, while LangChain relies on unique tool names across servers.

### Pattern 3: Bidirectional Integration

The most mature frameworks support both consuming and exposing MCP:

- **LangGraph Agent Server** → exposes agents via `/mcp` endpoint
- **LlamaIndex** → `workflow_as_mcp` converts Workflows to MCP servers
- **Haystack** → Hayhooks exposes pipelines as MCP servers
- **Mastra** → `MCPServer` class exposes tools, agents, and workflows
- **Spring AI** → server starters expose Spring beans as MCP tools

This creates composable architectures where framework A's agent can consume framework B's pipeline via MCP, without either framework knowing about the other.

### Pattern 4: Transport Migration

The ecosystem is migrating from SSE to Streamable HTTP as the preferred remote transport:

- **PydanticAI** has explicitly deprecated SSE
- **Haystack** defaults to `StreamableHttpServerInfo`
- **Spring AI** supports Streamable HTTP alongside SSE and stdio
- **Vercel AI SDK 6** supports all three but emphasizes HTTP

Stdio remains standard for local servers, but for remote connections, Streamable HTTP offers better compatibility with standard HTTP infrastructure (load balancers, proxies, CDNs) and doesn't require long-lived connections.

## Choosing the Right Framework for MCP

The choice depends less on MCP support — it's universal now — and more on your existing stack and requirements:

**Choose LangChain/LangGraph if** you want the most mature MCP adapter with advanced features (interceptors, elicitation, multimodal), need LangSmith observability, or want bidirectional MCP via the Agent Server. Best for complex agent architectures.

**Choose CrewAI if** you're building multi-agent crews and want the simplest MCP configuration via the native DSL. The `mcps=["url"]` syntax is the lowest-friction way to add MCP tools to agents.

**Choose LlamaIndex if** your primary use case is RAG or data pipelines and you want to expose them as MCP servers via `workflow_as_mcp`. Strong bidirectional story.

**Choose Vercel AI SDK if** you're building TypeScript web applications and want stable, production-ready MCP client support with OAuth authentication.

**Choose Mastra if** you want a TypeScript-first framework with deep Next.js integration and full MCP client/server capabilities.

**Choose PydanticAI if** you prefer Pydantic's type-safe approach and want a framework that's already committed to Streamable HTTP over SSE.

**Choose Spring AI if** you're in a Java/Spring Boot enterprise environment. The YAML configuration and annotation-driven server exposure fit naturally into Spring applications.

**Choose DSPy if** you're using DSPy's declarative optimization approach and need to add external tool access via MCP.

## Security Considerations

MCP tool integration through frameworks inherits all the security considerations of [MCP itself](/guides/mcp-security-best-practices/), plus framework-specific concerns:

- **Tool trust boundaries**: When a framework loads tools from an MCP server, it trusts the server's tool descriptions. A malicious server could craft descriptions that manipulate LLM behavior (tool poisoning). Validate tool descriptions before exposing them to LLMs.
- **Multi-server credential isolation**: When connecting to multiple MCP servers, ensure credentials for one server can't leak to another. Most frameworks handle this correctly, but verify that HTTP headers configured for one server aren't sent to others.
- **Transport security**: Always use TLS for remote MCP connections. Stdio transport inherits the security of the local process — ensure server binaries come from trusted sources.
- **Interceptor security**: LangChain's interceptors and similar middleware patterns can access sensitive context (API keys, user data, agent state). Audit interceptor code carefully.
- **Bidirectional exposure**: When exposing your agent or workflow as an MCP server, you're creating an API surface. Apply the same security practices you would for any public API — authentication, rate limiting, input validation.

For a deeper dive, see our [MCP Security Best Practices](/guides/mcp-security-best-practices/) and [MCP Authentication and OAuth 2.1](/guides/mcp-authentication-oauth/) guides.

## The Bigger Picture

MCP's universal adoption across AI frameworks represents a fundamental shift in how AI tool ecosystems work. Instead of each framework maintaining its own tool integrations — LangChain tools, CrewAI tools, LlamaIndex tools — the industry has converged on a shared protocol layer.

This convergence creates real value: MCP server developers build once and reach every framework. Framework developers focus on agent orchestration rather than tool integration. And teams can mix frameworks in production — a LangGraph agent consuming tools from a Spring AI MCP server, or a CrewAI crew using tools exposed by a LlamaIndex RAG pipeline — without framework lock-in.

The remaining friction is transport convergence (Streamable HTTP is winning) and capability parity (not all frameworks support resources and prompts yet). But the direction is clear: MCP is becoming the USB-C of AI tool integration — a universal connector that makes the framework choice orthogonal to the tool choice.
