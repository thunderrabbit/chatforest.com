Environmental monitoring is one of the most data-intensive domains on the planet. A single weather station generates continuous streams of temperature, humidity, pressure, wind, and precipitation data. Multiply that by tens of thousands of stations, add satellite constellations capturing multispectral imagery every few days, layer in ocean buoys, air quality sensors, seismic networks, river gauges, and carbon monitoring instruments — and you have a firehose of environmental data that no human team can fully process.

The numbers are substantial. The global environmental monitoring market reached approximately $15.5–16.1 billion in 2025 and is projected to grow to $21–26 billion by 2030 at about 5.6–5.8% CAGR. AI in environmental sustainability is growing much faster — valued at roughly $17.2 billion in 2024 and projected to reach $100 billion by 2034 at 19.4% CAGR. Over 50% of environmental monitoring systems now integrate IoT and AI for real-time data collection and predictive analysis, and adoption of AI-enabled predictive environmental analytics has jumped 47%.

MCP provides a structured protocol for connecting AI assistants to environmental data sources. Rather than building custom integrations for each weather API, satellite data archive, air quality network, and carbon tracking platform, MCP-connected agents can query weather forecasts, search satellite imagery catalogs, monitor air quality indices, calculate carbon emissions, track wildfires, and analyze ocean conditions — all through defined tool interfaces with consistent error handling and authentication.

This guide covers the environmental monitoring MCP ecosystem — weather and climate, air quality, satellite earth observation, carbon emissions, ocean and marine monitoring, wildfire and natural hazards, and architecture patterns for environmental AI operations. Our analysis draws on published documentation, open-source repositories, and environmental science reporting — we research and analyze rather than deploying these systems ourselves.

## Why Environmental Monitoring Needs MCP

Environmental monitoring has characteristics that make standardized AI integration both exceptionally valuable and particularly challenging:

**Data fragmentation across agencies and scales.** Environmental data comes from dozens of disconnected sources — NOAA for weather, NASA for satellite imagery, EPA for air and water quality, USGS for geological and hydrological data, ESA for Copernicus satellite missions, national weather services worldwide, and thousands of local monitoring networks. A researcher studying drought conditions might need to correlate satellite vegetation indices with precipitation records, soil moisture data, river flow measurements, and historical climate normals — each from a different system with different APIs and data formats. MCP servers that wrap these individual sources into standard tool interfaces make cross-system environmental queries practical.

**Temporal urgency varies dramatically.** Some environmental data is life-safety critical — severe weather warnings, wildfire detection, flood alerts — where minutes matter. Other data is archival, with researchers analyzing decades of climate records to detect trends. MCP's structured tool definitions can handle both: real-time alert tools that return the latest observations alongside historical query tools that search years of archived data.

**Spatial complexity is inherent.** Environmental data is fundamentally geospatial — every observation has a location, and meaningful analysis requires combining data across geographic regions at different resolutions. Satellite imagery comes in pixels, weather stations report from points, air quality networks cover cities, and climate models operate on global grids. MCP servers that handle coordinate lookups, bounding box queries, and spatial aggregation abstract this complexity from the AI agent.

**Data volumes exceed human processing capacity.** A single Sentinel-2 satellite pass generates roughly 1.6 TB of data. NOAA's weather models produce petabytes annually. Air quality networks report millions of hourly readings. AI agents connected through MCP can filter, aggregate, and extract insights from these volumes — finding the specific satellite scenes showing deforestation, identifying weather stations reporting anomalous readings, or tracking emission patterns across regions.

**Open data traditions align with MCP's model.** Environmental science has strong open data norms. Most government weather, satellite, and air quality data is freely available, and international agreements promote environmental data sharing. This creates a natural ecosystem for MCP servers — there are real, accessible APIs to wrap, and the barrier to building useful integrations is engineering time rather than data licensing.

## Weather and Climate MCP Servers

Weather and climate data is one of the most mature categories in environmental MCP development, with multiple servers offering different levels of depth and geographic coverage.

### Comprehensive Weather Platforms

**Weather MCP** (github.com/weather-mcp/weather-mcp — 4 stars) is the most feature-rich weather MCP server, providing 16 tools that go well beyond basic forecasts. Tools include weather forecasting with global coverage and up to 16-day extended forecasts, current conditions for US locations, active weather alerts, historical weather data from 1940 to present, air quality monitoring with AQI calculations, marine conditions (wave height, swell, currents), weather radar imagery and precipitation maps, lightning strike detection with safety assessments, river level monitoring and flood status, wildfire tracking using NIFC data with proximity alerts, severe weather probability forecasts, fire weather indices, climate normals for historical comparison, snow and ice accumulation, and saved location management. It requires no API keys, using NOAA's API for detailed US weather plus Open-Meteo for international coverage. Smart threshold-based display filters noise from results, and intelligent in-memory caching reduces redundant API calls.

**Open-Meteo MCP** (github.com/cmer81/open-meteo-mcp — 37 stars) provides comprehensive access to the Open-Meteo weather API suite, which is notable for requiring no API keys for non-commercial use. It integrates data from multiple meteorological models — DWD ICON (European coverage), NOAA GFS (global with North America focus), Météo-France AROME/ARPEGE, ECMWF, JMA, MET Norway, and Environment Canada GEM. Beyond standard forecasts, it offers 7-day forecasts with hourly and daily resolution, historical ERA5 reanalysis data from 1940 onwards, air quality monitoring including PM2.5, PM10, ozone, and pollen, marine conditions (wave height, period, direction, sea surface temperature), flood forecasting via GloFAS, seasonal forecasts extending 9 months ahead, climate projections using CMIP6 scenarios, ensemble forecasts showing prediction uncertainty, and elevation and geocoding capabilities. It supports deployment via npx, global npm, Docker, or Streamable HTTP transport for remote hosting.

### Specialized Weather Servers

Multiple additional weather MCP servers target specific APIs and use cases:

**OpenMeteo MCP Server** by gbrigandi retrieves current conditions, forecasts, historical data, and location search worldwide using the Open-Meteo API. **AccuWeather MCP** servers by adhikasp and TimLukaHorstmann provide hourly forecasts using the AccuWeather API. **OpenWeatherMap MCP** servers by jezweb and SaintDoresh integrate with OpenWeatherMap for weather data, forecasts, air quality, and location services — the latter specifically designed for Claude Desktop integration. The **NWS Weather MCP Server** by Dennison Bertram and the **National Weather Service MCP** by Jack Kuo focus specifically on NOAA's National Weather Service API for detailed US weather data.

### Climate and Historical Data

Climate analysis requires access to long-term historical records and climate model projections. The Open-Meteo MCP server's ERA5 reanalysis data (1940–present) is particularly valuable here, providing hourly temperature, precipitation, wind, humidity, and solar radiation at roughly 25 km global resolution. Its CMIP6 climate projections enable AI agents to compare current conditions against modeled future scenarios under different emission pathways — useful for climate impact assessment and adaptation planning.

The **NASA POWER** dataset, accessible through the agriculture MCP server (github.com/AiAgentKarl/agriculture-mcp-server), provides climate data since 1981 derived from satellite and model sources, focusing on solar radiation, temperature, and precipitation parameters relevant to energy and agriculture applications.

## Air Quality MCP Servers

Air quality monitoring connects AI agents to real-time pollution data from sensor networks worldwide.

**AQICN MCP** (github.com/mattmarcin/aqicn-mcp — 1 star) provides access to the World Air Quality Index project's global monitoring network through 3 tools: city_aqi (retrieve AQI, station name, dominant pollutant, timestamp, and coordinates for any city), geo_aqi (fetch air quality by latitude/longitude coordinates), and search_station (find monitoring stations by keyword). The AQICN network aggregates data from thousands of stations worldwide, reporting pollutants including PM2.5, PM10, ozone, NO2, SO2, and CO with standardized AQI calculations.

Several weather MCP servers also include air quality capabilities. The **Weather MCP** server provides air quality monitoring with AQI calculations as one of its 16 tools. The **Open-Meteo MCP** includes PM2.5, PM10, ozone, and pollen monitoring. The **OpenWeatherMap MCP** servers offer air quality data alongside weather information. These bundled implementations mean an AI agent focused on general environmental monitoring can access air quality data without needing a separate dedicated server.

## Satellite Earth Observation MCP Servers

Satellite imagery is fundamental to environmental monitoring — tracking deforestation, mapping urban expansion, monitoring crop health, detecting wildfires, measuring sea ice extent, and dozens of other applications. Several MCP servers now provide access to major satellite data archives.

### Official and High-Profile Implementations

**NASA Earthdata MCP** (github.com/nasa/earthdata-mcp — 4 stars) is notable as an official NASA project, providing MCP access to NASA's Earthdata catalog — one of the world's largest archives of Earth science data covering atmosphere, land, ocean, and cryosphere observations. It features semantic search capabilities powered by embeddings, meaning AI agents can describe what they're looking for in natural language rather than navigating complex catalog structures. The production endpoint at cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/mcp/sse supports both HTTP and STDIO modes, with deployment on AWS using ECS Fargate, PostgreSQL with pgvector, and Redis caching.

**Microsoft Earth Copilot** (github.com/microsoft/Earth-Copilot — 140 stars) is the highest-starred environmental MCP server, originally built as an AI-powered geospatial application for exploring Earth science data using natural language. Its MCP server mode exposes satellite search, terrain analysis, mobility classification, building damage assessment, and extreme weather analysis to VS Code GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, and other MCP-compatible assistants. It deploys on Azure Container Apps with API Management integration.

**Copernicus MCP** (github.com/wb1016/copernicus-mcp — 2 stars) provides comprehensive access to ESA's Copernicus Earth Observation data — the European Union's flagship satellite program. Tools cover search and discovery across all five Sentinel missions (Sentinel-1 SAR radar through Sentinel-5P atmospheric monitoring), individual and batch image downloads with concurrent processing, quicklook previews, temporal coverage analysis, and file management with age-based and size-based cleanup. Authentication uses Copernicus Data Space credentials with token caching.

### Research-Oriented Implementations

**Planetary Computer MCP** (github.com/isaaccorley/planetary-computer-mcp — 2 stars) connects to Microsoft's Planetary Computer STAC API, providing unified access to satellite and geospatial datasets through 2 primary tools: download_data (for raster imagery, DEMs, land cover, and climate data) and download_geometries (for vector and building data in GeoParquet format). A key usability feature is natural language location support — specifying "San Francisco" rather than coordinates, with automatic bounding box conversion. It generates automatic visualizations for LLM interpretation.

**Axion-MCP** (github.com/Dhenenjay/Axion-MCP — 4 stars) is an advanced Google Earth Engine MCP server providing access to 30+ satellite datasets including Landsat, Sentinel, and MODIS. Its 6 consolidated tools cover dataset search, image analysis, data export, configuration management, web visualization, and ML-powered crop classification. Notable for environmental monitoring are its 5 specialized geospatial models for wildfire risk assessment, flood hazard evaluation, agricultural monitoring, deforestation tracking, and water quality analysis, plus vegetation index calculations (NDVI, NDWI, EVI, SAVI, NBR) and cloud-free composite generation.

**GIS MCP Server** (github.com/mahdin75/gis-mcp) connects LLMs to GIS operations using GIS libraries, enabling geospatial transformations, downloading and stacking bands from STAC items (Sentinel-2, Landsat), and optional crop and reprojection — a lower-level server for agents that need to process raw satellite data.

## Carbon Emissions and Sustainability MCP Servers

Carbon tracking MCP servers enable AI agents to calculate, monitor, and report on greenhouse gas emissions.

**Climatiq MCP Server** (github.com/jagan-shanmugam/climatiq-mcp-server — 8 stars) is the most comprehensive carbon calculation MCP server, providing access to the Climatiq API for real-time emission calculations across multiple categories: electricity consumption, travel (car, plane, train), cloud computing, freight transport, procurement, and hotel stays. It includes a search tool for querying Climatiq's emission factor database, custom calculations using specific emission factors, expense-based travel emissions, resource URIs for detailed factor information, and a natural language prompt for generating human-readable climate impact explanations. This makes it possible for an AI agent to estimate the carbon footprint of a business trip, a cloud deployment, or a supply chain operation through structured MCP tool calls.

The broader carbon tracking ecosystem includes tools that could benefit from MCP integration. **Cloud Carbon Footprint** (open-source, 4,800+ GitHub stars) estimates energy use and CO2 emissions from AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud usage. **CodeCarbon** (3,800+ stars) tracks compute emissions from GPU, CPU, and RAM power consumption. The **Green Software Foundation's Carbon Aware SDK** helps build software that runs during periods of lower carbon intensity. While these aren't currently MCP servers, their APIs and data could be wrapped in MCP interfaces — a natural evolution as the carbon tracking ecosystem matures.

## Ocean and Marine MCP Servers

Ocean monitoring connects AI agents to tidal data, marine conditions, and oceanographic observations.

**NOAA Tides MCP** (github.com/seanofahey/mcp-noaa-tides — 1 star) provides access to NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) through 3 tools: get_water_levels (real-time and historical water level measurements), get_tide_predictions (high/low tide forecasts with configurable intervals), and get_station_info (metadata for NOAA monitoring stations using 7-digit IDs). Parameters support customizable datum references, timezone selection, and unit preferences.

Marine conditions are also covered by broader weather MCP servers. The **Weather MCP** server includes marine conditions as one of its 16 tools. The **Open-Meteo MCP** provides marine data including wave height, wave period, wave direction, and sea surface temperature. These bundled implementations provide useful marine environmental monitoring without requiring dedicated ocean-specific servers.

For deeper oceanographic research, the satellite MCP servers become relevant — Sentinel-3 (accessible via the Copernicus MCP) carries ocean color and sea surface temperature instruments, while NASA's MODIS and other ocean-observing satellites are searchable through the Earthdata MCP.

## Wildfire and Natural Hazard Monitoring

Wildfire detection and natural hazard monitoring are among the most time-sensitive environmental monitoring applications.

**Weather MCP's** wildfire tracking tool uses NIFC (National Interagency Fire Center) data to report active wildfires and prescribed burns within a specified radius, including fire size, containment status, and proximity-based safety assessments. Its severe weather probability forecasts and fire weather indices add predictive capability for fire risk assessment.

For satellite-based wildfire detection, the **Axion-MCP** Earth Engine server provides dedicated wildfire risk assessment models and includes the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) vegetation index for mapping burn severity. NASA's FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System) active fire data is accessible through the Earthdata MCP, providing near-real-time fire detection from MODIS and VIIRS satellite instruments.

The **Gov MCP Servers Collection** includes a natural disaster intelligence server covering FEMA, NOAA, and USGS data — useful for correlating wildfire events with emergency declarations and response resources. The Weather MCP's river monitoring and flood status tools add hydrological hazard tracking.

## Agriculture and Soil Monitoring

Agricultural environmental monitoring bridges weather, soil, and climate data for food production systems.

**Agriculture MCP Server** (github.com/AiAgentKarl/agriculture-mcp-server) provides 8 tools across soil conditions (temperature at 0–54 cm depth, moisture, evapotranspiration), crop weather forecasts, historical climate data from NASA POWER since 1981, global agriculture statistics via World Bank data (20+ indicators), and food product databases via Open Food Facts (3M+ products). All APIs are free and require no keys — useful for environmental monitoring of agricultural land conditions and food system sustainability analysis.

Soil and vegetation monitoring is also supported through satellite MCP servers — the Axion-MCP's NDVI, NDWI, and EVI vegetation indices enable tracking of crop health, drought stress, and land use changes, while its ML-powered crop classification tool maps agricultural land from satellite imagery.

## Architecture Patterns for Environmental AI

Environmental monitoring presents distinct architectural challenges due to the diversity of data sources, the range of temporal and spatial scales, and the mix of real-time and archival access patterns. Here are four patterns that address common environmental monitoring scenarios.

### Pattern 1: Multi-Source Environmental Dashboard

```

This pattern uses long-term historical data and climate projections for research and trend analysis. The AI agent accesses ERA5 reanalysis data (1940–present) through the Open-Meteo MCP to establish historical baselines, then compares against CMIP6 climate projections under different emission scenarios. Useful for: academic climate research, climate risk assessment for insurance and real estate, agricultural adaptation planning, infrastructure resilience evaluation.

### Pattern 3: Real-Time Hazard Monitoring

              └─────────────┘          └─────────────┘
```

This pattern monitors multiple hazard types simultaneously, with the Weather MCP providing the widest tool coverage (alerts, wildfires, river levels, lightning, fire weather indices) and satellite-based fire detection adding a complementary data source. The AI agent continuously checks for emerging threats and escalates when thresholds are exceeded. Useful for: emergency management, wildfire response coordination, flood warning systems, utility storm preparation.

### Pattern 4: Carbon and Sustainability Intelligence

```

This pattern combines carbon emission calculations with environmental monitoring data for comprehensive sustainability analysis. An AI agent can calculate the carbon footprint of business operations through Climatiq, check local air quality impacts via AQICN, monitor vegetation and land use changes through satellite imagery, and contextualize findings against climate trends. Useful for: ESG reporting, corporate sustainability assessments, environmental compliance, impact investing due diligence, climate risk disclosure.

## Security and Data Quality Considerations

Environmental monitoring MCP integrations face specific security and data quality challenges.

### Data Provenance and Quality

Environmental data quality varies enormously. Official government sources (NOAA, NASA, EPA, ESA) maintain rigorous quality control, calibration, and validation procedures. Community sensor networks (like some air quality stations in the AQICN network) may have lower accuracy but broader coverage. AI agents using environmental MCP servers should understand and communicate data provenance — a PM2.5 reading from an EPA reference-grade monitor is fundamentally different from one from a low-cost consumer sensor.

Satellite imagery introduces additional quality considerations: cloud cover, atmospheric correction, sensor calibration, spatial resolution, and temporal gaps between passes all affect what can be reliably derived from the data. MCP servers like Copernicus MCP that include cloud cover filtering in their search tools help agents select suitable imagery.

### API Rate Limiting and Fair Use

Most environmental data APIs are free but rate-limited. Open-Meteo allows generous non-commercial use but requires paid plans for commercial applications. NOAA APIs have request limits. NASA Earthdata requires authentication for bulk access. MCP servers that implement client-side caching (like Weather MCP's in-memory cache) reduce unnecessary API calls and help stay within rate limits, but agents should be aware of these constraints when making repeated queries.

### Credential Management

Several environmental MCP servers require API keys or credentials — Copernicus MCP needs Copernicus Data Space authentication, AccuWeather and OpenWeatherMap servers need paid API keys, and NASA Earthdata requires user accounts for certain access levels. Following standard MCP security practices, credentials should be stored in environment variables rather than configuration files, rotated regularly, and never logged in tool call results.

### Licensing and Attribution

Environmental data often comes with specific licensing and attribution requirements. Copernicus data requires attribution to ESA and the EU Copernicus programme. NOAA data is generally public domain but downstream products may have restrictions. Open-Meteo's data is available under Creative Commons licenses. AI agents generating reports from environmental MCP data should track and include appropriate attribution.

### Operational Reliability

Environmental monitoring applications — especially hazard monitoring — may need high availability. MCP servers that depend on external APIs inherit those APIs' reliability characteristics. Consider redundancy (multiple weather data sources, for instance), graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable, and clear communication to users when data may be stale or incomplete. The Weather MCP's service status checking tool is a useful pattern here.

## Ecosystem Gaps

Several important environmental monitoring areas have limited or no MCP coverage:

**Water quality monitoring.** Despite extensive sensor networks for rivers, lakes, and drinking water systems (EPA's Water Quality Portal, USGS NWIS), there are no dedicated water quality MCP servers. This is a significant gap — water quality data is critical for public health, ecosystem assessment, and regulatory compliance.

**Biodiversity and species tracking.** Platforms like GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), iNaturalist, eBird, and Wildlife Insights contain enormous biodiversity datasets, but MCP integration is minimal. A Wildlife Insights MCP server appears in some directories but lacks maturity. Given the biodiversity crisis, connecting AI agents to species observation and conservation data represents a valuable opportunity.

**Noise and vibration monitoring.** Environmental noise is a recognized public health concern, and sensor networks exist in many cities, but no MCP servers provide access to noise monitoring data.

**Soil contamination and remediation.** EPA's Superfund and brownfield databases, state environmental databases, and contamination monitoring networks lack MCP interfaces.

**Real-time satellite tasking.** Current MCP servers provide access to archived satellite imagery but cannot task satellites for new acquisitions. As commercial satellite operators (Planet, Maxar, Capella) develop APIs for on-demand imaging, MCP servers that could request specific satellite passes for emergency monitoring would be valuable.

**Integrated environmental compliance.** While individual data sources are available, no MCP server provides an integrated view of environmental permits, violations, emissions reporting, and compliance status — the kind of cross-reference that environmental regulators and compliance officers need daily.

**Acoustic and underwater monitoring.** Ocean acoustic monitoring for marine mammals, ship traffic, and seismic activity has no MCP representation, despite growing datasets from hydrophone networks.

## Getting Started by Role

**Environmental Researchers:** Start with the Open-Meteo MCP for climate data (ERA5 historical, CMIP6 projections) and NASA Earthdata MCP for satellite imagery. These two servers cover the data sources most commonly used in environmental research.

**Emergency Managers:** The Weather MCP's 16 tools — especially weather alerts, wildfire tracking, river monitoring, and lightning detection — provide the broadest hazard monitoring from a single server. Add satellite-based fire detection via Earthdata MCP for redundancy.

**Sustainability Analysts:** Combine the Climatiq MCP for carbon calculations with AQICN for air quality monitoring and Open-Meteo for climate context. This trio covers the core data needs for ESG reporting and sustainability assessments.

**Agriculture and Land Management:** The Agriculture MCP server provides soil and crop weather data, while Axion-MCP adds satellite-based vegetation monitoring with NDVI and crop classification. Open-Meteo's historical climate data supports long-term agricultural planning.

**Urban Planners:** Start with AQICN for air quality, Weather MCP for local conditions and flood risk, and satellite imagery servers for land use change analysis. The gap in noise monitoring means that dimension of urban environmental quality currently requires other approaches.

**Conservation Scientists:** NASA Earthdata MCP and Axion-MCP provide satellite-based habitat monitoring (deforestation, water quality, fire risk), but the lack of biodiversity-specific MCP servers means species data access still requires direct API integration with platforms like GBIF and eBird.

*This guide reflects the state of the environmental monitoring MCP ecosystem as of late March 2026. Environmental monitoring is a rapidly evolving field, and new MCP servers connecting to climate, weather, satellite, and ecological data sources appear regularly. We will update this guide as the ecosystem develops. See our [complete MCP server directory](/guides/best-mcp-servers/) and [geospatial/GIS guide](/guides/mcp-geospatial-gis/) for related coverage.*
