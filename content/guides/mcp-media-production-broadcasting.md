AI is reshaping media production at an unprecedented pace. The global AI in media and entertainment market reached $33.7 billion in 2025, projected to hit $99.5 billion by 2030 at a 24.2% CAGR according to Grand View Research. The AI video generation and editing software segment alone is forecast to grow from $3.67 billion in 2026 to $24.89 billion by 2036. AI content generation broadly — spanning text, image, audio, and video — is expected to reach $26.73 billion by 2030. Companies built from the ground up on AI media tools are projected to operate with 20–30% of the human costs of traditional media companies by late 2026.

The creative tools ecosystem is responding. Every major game engine now has MCP integration. DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Ableton Live all have substantial community-built MCP servers. ElevenLabs launched an official MCP server with voice cloning, text-to-speech, and audio processing. Cloudinary, Figma, Canva, and Mux have released official MCP implementations connecting AI agents to media asset management, design, and video delivery infrastructure.

MCP — the Model Context Protocol — provides a standardized way for AI agents to connect to creative software, media platforms, and production tools. Rather than building custom integrations for each NLE, DAW, or streaming service, MCP-connected agents can edit video timelines, mix audio tracks, manage live streams, and process media assets through defined tool interfaces. For an introduction to MCP itself, see our [introduction to MCP](/guides/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp/).

The media production MCP ecosystem reveals a striking pattern: creative tools with scripting APIs get MCP servers quickly (FFmpeg, Ableton, DaVinci Resolve, Blender), while closed platforms lag behind. Professional broadcast infrastructure — Wirecast, vMix, Tricaster, playout automation — has zero MCP presence. Major DAWs beyond Ableton (Pro Tools, Logic Pro, FL Studio, Cubase) remain disconnected. Every major podcast hosting platform lacks MCP support. The gap between what's possible and what's implemented defines the current state of AI in media production.

This guide is research-based. We survey what MCP servers exist across the media production landscape, analyze the architecture patterns they enable, and identify where significant gaps remain. We do not claim to have tested or used any of these servers hands-on — our analysis draws on published documentation, open-source repositories, vendor announcements, and industry research.

## Why Media Production Needs MCP

Media production involves complex, multi-tool workflows that MCP is architecturally well-suited to connect.

**Video editing spans multiple specialized applications.** A typical video production pipeline involves capture/ingest, assembly editing, color grading, visual effects, audio mixing, and export — often across different applications. DaVinci Resolve handles color grading and editing, After Effects manages motion graphics, Premiere Pro handles assembly, and FFmpeg does final encoding. MCP-connected agents could orchestrate across these tools, moving projects between stages without manual export/import cycles.

**Audio production requires precise multi-track coordination.** Music production involves composing MIDI patterns, recording audio, applying effects chains, mixing dozens of tracks, and mastering the final output — all within a DAW that manages hundreds of parameters per track. MCP servers connecting to DAWs like Ableton Live (2,358 stars) enable AI agents to adjust levels, apply effects, generate MIDI patterns, and manage sessions through natural language rather than complex parameter manipulation.

**Live streaming demands real-time decision-making.** A live broadcast involves scene switching, source management, audio mixing, graphic overlays, and stream health monitoring — simultaneously. OBS MCP servers enable AI agents to manage scenes, control sources, trigger transitions, and start/stop recording or streaming. As solo content creation grows, AI-orchestrated production reduces the cognitive load of managing multiple production elements simultaneously.

**Media asset management is increasingly unmanageable.** Organizations produce terabytes of media across photos, video, audio, graphics, and documents. Finding, transforming, and delivering the right asset in the right format requires searching metadata, applying transformations (crop, resize, transcode, compress), and optimizing for different delivery channels. Official MCP servers from Cloudinary and Transloadit (86+ processing robots) connect AI agents to industrial-strength media processing pipelines.

**Content distribution has multiplied.** A single piece of content might need to be formatted for YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, podcasts, blog posts, and email newsletters — each with different specifications. MCP servers connecting to transcription (Whisper), video processing (FFmpeg), image generation (GPT-4o, Gemini), and distribution platforms could automate the repurposing pipeline that currently consumes significant creator time.

## Video Production and Editing

Video editing is the most developed category in the media production MCP ecosystem, with approximately 40 servers spanning general-purpose FFmpeg processing, professional NLE integrations, and specialized tools.

### FFmpeg — The Universal Video Processing Layer

FFmpeg is the backbone of nearly all video processing workflows, and its command-line interface makes it a natural fit for MCP integration. At least seven independent MCP server implementations exist.

**video-creator/ffmpeg-mcp** | 126 stars | ~15 tools

According to repository documentation, this server provides video search, trimming, stitching, playback control, clip extraction, overlay application, and concatenation. It represents the most starred general-purpose FFmpeg MCP server as of early 2026.

**egoist/ffmpeg-mcp** | 119 stars | ~10 tools

A clean FFmpeg wrapper focused on simplicity. Provides core video and audio processing operations through a minimal API surface.

**misbahsy/video-audio-mcp** | 66 stars | ~12 tools

This represents one of the most production-ready MCP integrations across any creative domain.

### AI Music Generation

**sandraschi/suno-mcp** and **mcp-suno** (PyPI)

Suno, one of the leading consumer AI music generation platforms, has community MCP servers enabling custom and inspiration-mode music generation. However, the broader AI music generation space remains legally uncertain — major label lawsuits against both Suno and Udio are ongoing as of early 2026, and Udio disabled downloads in October 2025 without restoring them.

Additional audio tools include axiomantic/audiomancer (AI-assisted music production with TidalCycles), bretbouchard/audio_agent_mcp (audio analysis and MIDI learning), and batch audio processing servers using FFmpeg backends.

### Notable DAW Gaps

The absence of MCP servers for Pro Tools (the industry standard for film, broadcast, and professional music), Logic Pro (Apple's flagship DAW), FL Studio (widely used in electronic music and hip-hop), Cubase/Nuendo (Steinberg's professional DAWs), Adobe Audition, and Audacity represents a major gap. Pro Tools alone dominates film and broadcast post-production; its lack of MCP integration means the largest segment of professional audio production remains disconnected from AI agent workflows.

## Broadcasting and Live Streaming

Broadcasting MCP support is nascent, with OBS Studio leading community efforts and Dacast providing the only official vendor integration.

### OBS Studio

**royshil/obs-mcp** | 78 stars | ~20 tools

The primary OBS MCP server, connecting via WebSocket to provide scene management, source control, streaming and recording start/stop, and transition triggers. For solo creators managing their own live production, this enables AI agents to handle scene switching and source management while the creator focuses on content.

**sbroenne/mcp-server-obs** | 6 stars | ~15 tools

A .NET 10 implementation offering recordings, streaming, scenes, and window capture control. Additional implementations from yshk-mrt/obs-mcp (a YC hackathon project) and LarsCanGit/OBS-MCP expand the OBS MCP ecosystem.

### Dacast — Official Live Streaming

**Dacast MCP Live Stream Server** | **Official**

The only official vendor-built MCP server for live streaming. According to Dacast's announcement, it provides AI-driven live streaming automation including simulcast, DVR, recording, playlist management, and thumbnail generation. This represents a signal that streaming platforms are beginning to see MCP as relevant infrastructure.

### YouTube and Twitch

Focused on YouTube transcript extraction and content analysis rather than upload/management.

**ZubeidHendricks/youtube-mcp-server** | 473 stars | ~20 tools

A more comprehensive YouTube API integration with video management, Shorts creation, and advanced analytics. Over 40 additional YouTube MCP servers exist with various levels of functionality, making YouTube one of the most-served platforms in the entire MCP ecosystem.

**TomCools/twitch-mcp** (6 stars) and **mtane0412/twitch-mcp-server** (2 stars) provide basic Twitch integration for chat interaction and Helix API access.

### Professional Broadcasting Gaps

Zero MCP servers exist for professional broadcast infrastructure: Wirecast, vMix, Tricaster, Vizrt, Ross Video, Grass Valley, or any playout automation system (Imagine Communications, Harmonic, etc.). Similarly, MAM/PAM systems like Dalet and Avid Interplay have no MCP presence. This gap reflects the broadcast industry's slower adoption cycle and the specialized nature of broadcast equipment APIs.

## Media Asset Management

Media asset management MCP servers are few but include significant official vendor implementations.

**cloudinary/mcp-servers** | 8 stars | ~20 tools | **Official**

Cloudinary's official MCP implementation provides upload, transformation, search, organization, and delivery of media assets. Features include OAuth authentication, remote and local server options, MediaFlows integration, and structured metadata management. As one of the most widely used media management platforms, this is a strategically important MCP integration.

**Transloadit MCP Server** | **Official** | 86+ processing robots

Transloadit's official implementation exposes 86+ processing robots covering video encoding (HLS, MP4, WebM), image operations (resize, crop, watermark), audio transcoding, OCR, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and AI content moderation. The breadth of processing capabilities makes this one of the most functionally rich MCP servers in any category.

## Graphics, VFX, and 3D

The graphics and 3D category is dominated by game engine integrations and Adobe Creative Suite servers.

### Game Engines

**CoplayDev/unity-mcp** | 7,807 stars | 25+ tools

The highest-starred MCP server in the broader media production category (excluding Figma, which is primarily design-to-code). Provides Unity Editor bridge capabilities for asset management, scene manipulation, script generation, graphics settings, and package management. The star count reflects Unity's massive developer community and the utility of AI-assisted 3D development.

**chongdashu/unreal-mcp** | 1,661 stars | ~30 tools

- **seehiong/blender-mcp-n8n** (30 stars, 45+ tools): Blender automation from n8n workflows
- **youichi-uda/blender-mcp-pro** (4 stars, 100+ tools): Lights, modifiers, animation, shader/geometry nodes
- **RFingAdam/mcp-blender** (1 star, 218 tools): Claims the most comprehensive implementation including MSFS content creation
- **PatrykIti/blender-ai-mcp** (8 stars): Modular architecture with YAML workflows and semantic search

The proliferation of Blender MCP servers — with tool counts ranging from 30 to 218 — reflects both Blender's open architecture and the lack of an official or dominant implementation.

### Adobe Creative Suite and Design Platforms

**mikechambers/adb-mcp** | 531 stars | ~40 tools

A multi-application MCP server covering Adobe Photoshop, Affinity Photo, Affinity Designer, Affinity Publisher, and Canva. The cross-application approach enables workflows that span multiple creative tools.

**GLips/Figma-Context-MCP** | 14,024 stars | ~10 tools

A multimodal automation suite spanning FFmpeg, GIMP, Inkscape, Blender, FreeCAD, MATLAB, and Godot — demonstrating the potential for unified creative tool control through a single MCP interface.

## Podcast and Content Creation

Podcast production is one of the weakest categories in the media production MCP ecosystem, with only a handful of servers and zero coverage of major hosting platforms.

**Pod Engine MCP** provides direct AI agent access to podcast data. **chaodoze/transcriber** offers podcast transcription with speaker diarization, optimized for Apple Silicon. **quietnotion/barevalue-mcp** attempts a more complete solution: upload raw audio and receive edited episodes with filler removal, noise reduction, transcripts, show notes, and social media clips.

**NvkAnirudh/LinkedIn-Post-Generator** (20 stars) takes podcast/video content in a different direction — generating LinkedIn posts from YouTube video transcripts.

### The Podcast Platform Gap

No dedicated MCP servers exist for any major podcast hosting platform: Buzzsprout, Spotify for Creators (Anchor), RSS.com, Podbean, Transistor, Captivate, Libsyn, or Simplecast. Perhaps most notably, **Descript** — the leading AI-native podcast and video editor — has no MCP server despite having an API. **Riverside.fm**, the popular remote recording platform, and **Castmagic**, an AI podcast tool, are similarly absent. This gap means AI agents cannot currently manage podcast publishing, distribution, or analytics through MCP.

## Music and Audio Streaming Platforms

Music streaming has reasonable Spotify coverage but virtually nothing else.

### Spotify

**marcelmarais/spotify-mcp-server** | 269 stars | ~10 tools

The most starred Spotify implementation, providing lightweight playback control and playlist management.

**Carrieukie/spotify-mcp-server** (19 stars) and **PeterAkande/spotify_mcp** (36+ tools, the most comprehensive implementation) extend Spotify coverage with search, user profiles, and detailed playback control. Over 15 additional Spotify MCP servers exist with various levels of functionality.

### Apple Music and Other Platforms

**kennethreitz/mcp-applemusic** | 79 stars | ~10 tools

Apple Music control via AppleScript, macOS only. Additional implementations in Rust provide Apple Music Web API access with search and deep links.

**yuhuacheng/tidal-mcp** | 37 stars | ~8 tools

TIDAL authentication, favorites, recommendations, and playlist management.

**Epidemic Sound MCP** | **Official (Beta)**

Royalty-free music search and licensing for AI agents — particularly relevant for content creators who need licensed music programmatically.

### Streaming Platform Gaps

No MCP servers exist for SoundCloud, Bandcamp, Deezer, Amazon Music, Pandora, or YouTube Music as a standalone service. Given SoundCloud's 300+ million tracks and Bandcamp's importance to independent musicians, these gaps limit AI agent capabilities for music discovery, playlist management, and artist analytics across the broader streaming ecosystem.

## Image Generation and Editing

Image generation through AI models has attracted approximately 35 MCP server implementations, reflecting the rapid growth of AI image tools.

### AI Image Generation

**SureScaleAI/openai-gpt-image-mcp** | 97 stars | ~5 tools

Midjourney has community MCP support through Lala-0x3f/mj-mcp (7 stars) and ImaginePro MCP (multi-model: Midjourney, Flux, Nano Banana). Over 20 additional image generation servers support various providers including Gemini, Grok, RunPod, Azure, and OpenRouter.

### Design Platform Integration

Figma (14,024 stars community + 756 stars official) and Canva (official MCP) provide the strongest design platform MCP support. However, no standalone MCP servers exist for Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, Sketch, CorelDRAW, or Procreate. GIMP and Inkscape are available only through the multi-tool OmniMCP (3 stars) rather than dedicated implementations.

## Content Distribution and Delivery

Content distribution has the strongest official vendor presence relative to its size.

**Mux MCP Server** | **Official**

Video asset upload, playback policies, streaming analytics, and multi-CDN delivery from Mux, a major video infrastructure provider.

**Cloudflare Stream MCP** | **Official**

Upload via URL, live stream management, and signed URL generation, available as part of Cloudflare Agents.

**Transloadit MCP** | **Official** | 86+ processing robots

Media processing pipeline with HLS encoding, image optimization, and delivery capabilities.

**Cloudinary MCP** | 8 stars | **Official** | ~20 tools

Image and video transformation, optimization, and CDN delivery.

### Distribution Gaps

No MCP servers exist for Vimeo, Wistia, Brightcove, JW Player, Bunny Stream, AWS MediaConvert, or Azure Media Services. This means AI agents cannot currently manage professional video hosting, business video platforms, or cloud transcoding services through MCP — significant limitations for enterprise media workflows.

## Transcription and Captioning

Transcription MCP servers are built almost exclusively on OpenAI's Whisper model.

**arcaputo3/mcp-server-whisper** | 50 stars | ~5 tools

The most starred transcription server, combining OpenAI Whisper with GPT-4o for advanced audio transcription.

**BigUncle/Fast-Whisper-MCP-Server** (14 stars) provides high-performance speech recognition via Faster Whisper. **SmartLittleApps/local-stt-mcp** (12 stars) runs whisper.cpp locally with speaker diarization, multi-format output (TXT, JSON, VTT, SRT, CSV), and Apple Silicon optimization.

**tomoima525/vid-subtitle** (1 star) combines FFmpeg and Whisper API to add subtitles to videos. **EthanBobbyTR/VideoMCP** (1 star) extracts video frames and transcriptions via FFmpeg and Whisper.

The transcription ecosystem is functional but entirely community-built. No major transcription service (Rev, Otter.ai, Descript, AssemblyAI, Deepgram) has released an official MCP server, leaving the space to Whisper-based open-source implementations.

## AI Video Generation

AI video generation via MCP is in its earliest stages, with the landscape in flux due to major platform changes.

**writingmate/sora-2-mcp** (2 stars) and **strato-space/media-gen-mcp** (8 stars) provide OpenAI Sora 2 integration. However, OpenAI announced the Sora app shutdown for April 26, 2026 and API shutdown for September 24, 2026, making these servers time-limited.

**VidCraftAI** (2 stars) converts natural language to Manim mathematical animations. HeyGen MCP integration enables automated video creation via AI avatars. Google Veo MCP integration is referenced in skill tool repositories.

Google Veo 3.1 continues active development with 1080p output, synchronized audio, and non-destructive editing, positioning it as a potential successor in the AI video generation space. However, Runway ML, Pika Labs, and Kling AI — three of the most prominent AI video tools — have no MCP servers despite API availability.

## Screen Recording and Capture

**m2ai-mcp-servers/loom-mcp** provides Loom video management including list, retrieve, edit, and merge recording operations. **nihitgupta2/devstudio** (4 stars) offers screen recording, demo automation, multi-monitor support, and audio/video multiplexing.

## Architecture Patterns

Based on the available MCP servers, four architecture patterns emerge for AI-orchestrated media production.

### Pattern 1: AI Video Production Assistant

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

    ┌──────▼──────────▼──────────▼─────────────┐
    │          Cloudinary / Transloadit         │
    │       (Asset Management + Delivery)       │
    └──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This pattern connects an AI agent to the full video production pipeline: FFmpeg for ingest, encoding, and format conversion; DaVinci Resolve for editing, color grading, and audio mixing; After Effects for motion graphics and VFX compositing; and Cloudinary or Transloadit for final processing and delivery. The agent can coordinate across stages — importing footage via FFmpeg, creating sequences in Resolve, adding motion graphics in After Effects, and delivering optimized outputs through the asset management layer.

### Pattern 2: AI Music Production Pipeline

```

A content repurposing agent transforms long-form content into multiple formats: Whisper transcribes and diarizes the original audio/video; FFmpeg clips, resizes, and reformats for different platforms (vertical for TikTok/Reels, square for Instagram, widescreen for YouTube); AI image generation creates thumbnails and social graphics; and the asset management layer processes, optimizes, and delivers to all distribution channels. This pattern automates the most time-consuming aspect of modern content creation — reformatting a single piece of content for multiple platforms.

## Regulatory Considerations

Media production MCP integrations operate in an increasingly regulated landscape around AI-generated content, copyright, and deepfakes.

### AI Content Labeling and Transparency

**EU AI Act Article 50** transparency obligations become enforceable **August 2, 2026** — requiring disclosure of AI interactions, labeling of synthetic content, and deepfake identification. The AI Code of Practice provides voluntary guidance on labeling, watermarking, metadata, and technical measures ahead of enforcement. MCP servers generating or modifying media content will need to support content provenance standards, particularly the **C2PA** (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) framework for cryptographic content authentication that major platforms are adopting.

### Deepfake Legislation

The United States has rapidly expanded deepfake legislation. The **TAKE IT DOWN Act** (signed May 2025) criminalizes publishing non-consensual intimate imagery including AI deepfakes, with penalties up to 3 years in prison and a 48-hour platform removal requirement. The **DEFIANCE Act** (passed Senate unanimously January 2026) provides a federal civil remedy with statutory damages up to $150,000 ($250,000 when linked to assault, stalking, or harassment). As of February 2026, **46 US states** have enacted AI-generated media legislation, with bills increasingly targeting not just creators but AI platforms, payment processors, and hosting services.

### Copyright Uncertainty

The copyright status of AI-generated media remains actively contested. The US Copyright Office maintains that purely AI-generated works cannot be copyrighted, but human-guided AI-assisted works may be eligible. Major label lawsuits against Suno and Udio over music training data are ongoing, with implications for all generative audio tools. MCP servers connecting to AI generation tools should be deployed with awareness that the legal framework for AI-created content is still solidifying.

### Voice and Likeness Protection

Growing legislation protects individuals' voices and likenesses from unauthorized AI use. ElevenLabs' voice cloning capabilities — accessible through their official MCP server — operate in a space where consent requirements and likeness rights vary significantly by jurisdiction. Production workflows using voice AI through MCP should verify consent and compliance with applicable voice/likeness protection laws.

### Broadcast-Specific Considerations

AI-generated content in news and political broadcasting faces particular scrutiny. The FCC is discussing regulations for AI content in broadcast contexts. Multiple US states require disclosure of AI-generated content in political advertising, with deadlines and penalties that vary by jurisdiction. MCP servers controlling broadcast equipment or generating broadcast content carry heightened regulatory responsibility.

### Election Integrity

AI-generated political content faces strict disclosure requirements in multiple US states and the EU. Producers using MCP-connected AI tools for political content must navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements alongside emerging federal and EU regulations.

## Ecosystem Gaps Analysis

The media production MCP ecosystem has significant gaps that limit AI-orchestrated creative workflows.

### Professional Broadcast Infrastructure (Zero MCP Servers)

No MCP servers exist for any professional broadcast system: Wirecast, vMix, Tricaster, Vizrt, Ross Video, Grass Valley, or any playout automation system (Imagine Communications, Harmonic). Similarly, broadcast MAM/PAM systems (Dalet, Avid Interplay) are absent. This reflects the broadcast industry's conservative technology adoption and proprietary API ecosystems.

### Major DAWs Beyond Ableton (Zero MCP Servers)

Pro Tools (film/broadcast standard), Logic Pro (Apple's flagship), FL Studio (electronic/hip-hop staple), Cubase/Nuendo (Steinberg's professional suite), Adobe Audition, and even open-source Audacity have no MCP servers. Ableton's dominance in MCP reflects its Python Remote Script API, which enables the kind of external control that other DAWs make more difficult.

### Podcast Ecosystem (Near-Zero MCP Coverage)

Zero MCP servers for any podcast hosting platform (Buzzsprout, Spotify for Creators, Podbean, Transistor, Captivate, Libsyn, Simplecast). Descript, Riverside.fm, and Castmagic — all with APIs — have no MCP servers. This is perhaps the most surprising gap given the AI-native nature of modern podcast production.

### Video Hosting and Distribution (Limited Coverage)

Vimeo, Wistia, Brightcove, JW Player, and Bunny Stream have no MCP servers. AWS MediaConvert and Azure Media Services are absent. Only Mux, Cloudflare Stream, and Cloudinary (all official) provide MCP-based video delivery.

### AI Video Generation Tools (Minimal Coverage)

Runway ML, Pika Labs, and Kling AI — three of the most prominent AI video tools — have no MCP servers despite having APIs. With Sora shutting down in 2026, the AI video generation MCP space is poised for disruption as Google Veo continues development.

### Music Streaming Beyond Spotify (Minimal Coverage)

SoundCloud, Bandcamp, Deezer, Amazon Music, Pandora, and YouTube Music have no MCP servers. Only Spotify has meaningful community coverage.

### Professional Design Tools (Fragmented)

Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, Sketch, CorelDRAW, and Procreate have no standalone MCP servers. GIMP and Inkscape are available only through multi-tool suites (OmniMCP) rather than dedicated implementations.

## Getting Started

Practical entry points based on your role in media production.

### Video Editors

Start with **DaVinci Resolve MCP** (732 stars) if you use Resolve, or the **Premiere Pro MCP** (98 stars) for Adobe workflows. Pair with **FFmpeg MCP** (126 stars) for ingest, encoding, and format conversion. These servers can automate repetitive editing tasks — batch processing, format conversion, timeline assembly — while you focus on creative decisions.

### Music Producers

**Ableton Live MCP** (2,358 stars) is the clear starting point for Ableton users — the most mature DAW-MCP integration available. Add **ElevenLabs MCP** (1,278 stars, official) for voice synthesis and vocal processing. REAPER users should explore the ~58-tool REAPER MCP servers.

### Content Creators and Streamers

**OBS MCP** (78 stars) enables AI-assisted live production — scene switching, source management, stream control. Combine with **YouTube MCP** (507 stars) for content management and **Whisper MCP** (50 stars) for automated transcription and captioning.

### Motion Graphics and VFX Artists

**After Effects MCP** (257 stars) provides 30+ tools for composition control, layer management, and keyframe animation. **Blender MCP** servers offer 3D modeling and rendering automation. For game engine integration, **Unity MCP** (7,807 stars) and **Unreal MCP** (1,661 stars) are the most established options.

### Media Managers and Marketers

**Cloudinary MCP** (official) and **Transloadit MCP** (official, 86+ robots) provide industrial-strength media processing. **Canva MCP** (official) enables AI-assisted design. The **content repurposing** pattern (Whisper + FFmpeg + image generation + CDN delivery) automates multi-platform content distribution.

### Podcast Producers

Options are limited. **Whisper MCP** (50 stars) handles transcription with speaker diarization. **FFmpeg MCP** provides audio processing, trimming, and format conversion. **barevalue-mcp** attempts end-to-end podcast processing (filler removal, noise reduction, show notes). But podcast hosting and distribution remain manual until platforms build MCP support.
