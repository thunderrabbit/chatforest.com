Image generation is the most fragmented category in the MCP ecosystem. There's no dominant server, no official reference that works well (the [EverArt server](/reviews/everart-mcp-server/) scored 2.5/5 and was archived), and no consensus on whether the right approach is single-provider wrappers, multi-provider aggregators, or local inference bridges.

The most-starred image-specific MCP server has 232 stars. Compare that with Slack's MCP server at thousands of stars, or the Kubernetes MCP server at 1,300. This space is early and moving fast.

We've cataloged 20+ image generation MCP servers across four architectural approaches. Here's how they compare, and which ones are worth installing.

## Four Architectural Approaches

### 1. Single-Provider Cloud API Wrappers

Most image generation MCP servers wrap a single cloud API. You bring your API key, the server translates MCP tool calls into API requests. Simple, focused, limited to one provider's models.

**OpenAI — SureScaleAI/openai-gpt-image-mcp** (97 stars, TypeScript, MIT) — *dormant since May 2025*

Two tools: `create-image` (text-to-image) and `edit-image` (inpainting/outpainting with mask). Wraps OpenAI's gpt-image-1 model — currently the industry leader for prompt understanding and text rendering in images. File output or base64. Clean, focused implementation.

**Why choose it:** OpenAI's image models have the best prompt adherence. If you describe something complex, gpt-image-1 gets it right more often than alternatives. Image editing with masking is a genuine capability gap in most other servers.

**Stability AI — tadasant/mcp-server-stability-ai** (81 stars, 7 open issues, TypeScript, MIT) — *dormant since June 2025*

Six tools: `generate_image`, `generate_image_sd35`, `remove_background`, `outpaint`, `search_and_replace`, `search_and_recolor`. This is the richest editing toolkit in the category — background removal, recoloring objects, extending images, and replacing elements by description.

**Why choose it:** If your workflow involves editing existing images, not just generating new ones. Background removal and search-and-replace are production-ready capabilities most servers don't offer.

**Google Gemini — shinpr/mcp-image** (86 stars, TypeScript, MIT) — *actively maintained, v0.8.1 (March 2026)*

Image generation and editing via Google Gemini models. Automatic prompt optimization using a Subject-Context-Style framework. Three quality tiers (fast/balanced/quality). Character consistency across multiple generations. Up to 4K output resolution. New in v0.8.1: **Google Image Search grounding** alongside web search, plus security hardening of CI pipeline.

**Why choose it:** The most actively developed server in the category. Automatic prompt optimization means your agent doesn't need to craft perfect prompts — the server improves them before sending to the API. Character consistency is rare and valuable for creating coherent visual series. Google Image Search grounding adds reference-image-aware generation.

**Replicate (Flux) — awkoy/replicate-flux-mcp** (95 stars, TypeScript, MIT) — *dormant since August 2025*

Image generation via Flux Schnell on Replicate, plus SVG vector graphics generation via Recraft V3. Generation history browsing.

**Why choose it:** SVG vector output. If you need scalable graphics — logos, icons, diagrams — this is the only server that produces true vector output, not rasterized images.

**FAL.ai — raveenb/fal-mcp-server** (40 stars, 24 open issues, Python, MIT)

Access to 600+ models on FAL.ai's serverless inference platform. Dynamic model discovery via `list_models`. Queue support for long-running generation tasks with progress updates. Supports images, video, music, and audio. Both stdio and HTTP/SSE transport.

**Why choose it:** Broadest model catalog by far. If you want to experiment with many different models — FLUX Pro, Stable Diffusion, specialized models — FAL gives you access to everything through one API key.

### 2. Multi-Provider Aggregators

The most ambitious approach: one MCP server that routes to multiple image generation APIs.

**merlinrabens/image-gen-mcp-server** (9 stars → transferred to shipdeckai/image-gen → code now at shipdeckai/claude-skills, TypeScript, MIT)

Three tools: `image_config_providers` (list available providers), `image_generate` (create images), `image_edit` (modify images). Supports **10 providers**: Gemini, OpenAI DALL-E, Stability AI, Replicate, Leonardo.AI, Ideogram V3, Black Forest Labs (Flux), FAL.ai, Clipdrop, and Recraft V3.

Intelligent use-case detection automatically selects the best provider for each request. Auto-cleanup of old generated images.

**Why choose it:** Maximum flexibility. One server, ten providers. If one API goes down or changes pricing, switch to another without changing your MCP configuration. The trade-off: only 9 stars means minimal community validation, and the code has migrated to a different repo (shipdeckai/claude-skills), suggesting a shift in project direction.

**apinetwork/piapi-mcp-server** (69 stars, TypeScript, MIT) — *dormant since August 2025*

Routes to Midjourney, Flux, Kling, LumaLabs, Udio, and more through PiAPI's aggregation layer. Covers image generation, video generation, music generation, and 3D model generation.

**Why choose it:** Midjourney access. There's no official Midjourney MCP server, and all Midjourney MCP access goes through third-party API proxies. PiAPI is the most established aggregator. The trade-off: added cost and latency from the proxy layer, and you're trusting a third party with your Midjourney credentials.

### 3. Local Inference (ComfyUI)

For agents running on machines with GPUs, local inference means no API costs, no rate limits, and full control over models.

**joenorton/comfyui-mcp-server** (232 stars, Python, Apache 2.0)

The most popular image-generation-specific MCP server. A lightweight Python bridge to a local ComfyUI instance. Supports iterative image refinement — generate, review, adjust, re-generate. Also handles audio and video generation through ComfyUI workflows. Only 1 open issue. Added CI pipeline and Windows bug fixes in February 2026.

**Why choose it:** If you have a GPU and ComfyUI installed, this gives you unlimited free generation with any model you download — Stable Diffusion, Flux, custom fine-tunes. The iterative refinement workflow is unique: your agent can review its output and improve it.

**Other ComfyUI options:**
- **shawnrushefsky/comfyui-mcp** (6 stars, TypeScript) — more comprehensive ComfyUI bridge with auto-discovery of installed models, AnimateDiff, and Stable Video Diffusion support
- **alecc08/comfyui-mcp** (14 stars, TypeScript) — simpler bridge with text-to-image, img2img, and resize

**Ichigo3766/image-gen-mcp** (32 stars, JavaScript, MIT) bridges to existing Stable Diffusion WebUI installations (AUTOMATIC1111/ForgeUI) rather than ComfyUI. Dormant since July 2025.

### 4. Free, No-Auth Options

Two servers let agents generate images without any API key or account.

**pinkpixel-dev/MCPollinations** (39 stars, JavaScript, MIT)

Uses Pollinations.ai's free, open-source model infrastructure. Tools for image generation (URL or base64 with save), text generation, and audio generation. No signup, no API key, no cost.

**Why choose it:** Zero-friction starting point. If you want to see what agent-driven image generation feels like before committing to an API, this is the fastest path. Quality won't match paid APIs, but the barrier to entry is zero.

**evalstate/mcp-hfspace** (383 stars, TypeScript, MIT) — *dormant since June 2025*

Not image-specific — it's a general bridge to any HuggingFace Space. But many popular HF Spaces are image generation models (FLUX.1-schnell is a default). Optional HuggingFace token for private spaces, otherwise free. Auto-discovers endpoints from configured Spaces.

**Why choose it:** Access to the entire HuggingFace ecosystem through one MCP server. New models appear on HF Spaces daily — this server gives you immediate access without waiting for a dedicated MCP wrapper.

## The Midjourney Question

There's no official Midjourney MCP server. Every Midjourney MCP server uses a third-party API proxy:

- **apinetwork/piapi-mcp-server** (69 stars) — PiAPI proxy, the most established option
- **z23cc/midjourney-mcp** (9 stars) — GPTNB proxy, 7 tools including face swapping
- **AceDataCloud/MCPMidjourney** (2 stars) — AceDataCloud proxy, stdio + HTTP transport

All add cost on top of Midjourney's subscription and introduce a third-party trust dependency. If Midjourney quality is non-negotiable for your workflow, PiAPI is the safest bet. Otherwise, Flux models (available through Replicate, FAL, and local ComfyUI) produce comparable quality for most use cases.

## What's Missing from the Category

**No hosted remote servers.** Every image generation MCP server is self-hosted (stdio or local HTTP). Compare this with Slack (`mcp.slack.com`), Cloudflare, or New Relic — all hosted with zero-install setup. Image generation MCP is stuck in the "install it yourself" era.

**No official server that works.** The EverArt reference server was archived. No major image generation provider (OpenAI, Stability, Google, Midjourney) has shipped their own MCP server. Everything is community-built.

**Maintenance concerns.** Most servers in this category are dormant — 7 of 10 haven't seen a commit since 2025. Only shinpr/mcp-image shows consistent development activity. The OpenAI wrapper hasn't been updated since May 2025, the Stability wrapper since June 2025, and the Replicate wrapper since August 2025. This matters because image generation APIs change frequently.

**Limited editing.** Most servers are text-to-image only. Real production workflows need inpainting, outpainting, style transfer, image-to-image, and variations. Only Stability AI (tadasant) and OpenAI (SureScaleAI) servers offer meaningful editing.

**No batch generation.** No server is designed for generating multiple images efficiently — creating product catalogs, social media sets, or design variations at scale.

**Transport uniformity.** Almost everything is stdio-only. Only FAL (raveenb) supports HTTP/SSE. No Streamable HTTP servers exist in this category.

## Decision Flowchart

**"I just want to try image generation with my agent"**
→ MCPollinations (free, no auth, install in 30 seconds)

**"I need the best quality for production use"**
→ SureScaleAI/openai-gpt-image-mcp (OpenAI gpt-image-1 has best prompt adherence)

**"I need to edit images, not just generate them"**
→ tadasant/mcp-server-stability-ai (background removal, recoloring, outpainting, search-and-replace)

**"I want maximum model flexibility"**
→ raveenb/fal-mcp-server (600+ models) or merlinrabens/image-gen-mcp-server (10 providers)

**"I need SVG/vector output"**
→ awkoy/replicate-flux-mcp (Recraft V3 for true vector graphics)

**"I have a GPU and want free, unlimited generation"**
→ joenorton/comfyui-mcp-server (any model, no API costs, iterative refinement)

**"I need Midjourney specifically"**
→ apinetwork/piapi-mcp-server (PiAPI proxy — adds cost, but it's the most reliable indirect access)

**"I want smart prompt improvement"**
→ shinpr/mcp-image (automatic Subject-Context-Style optimization with Gemini)

## Trends to Watch

**Provider convergence.** OpenAI, Google, and Stability are all improving rapidly. The quality gap between providers is shrinking. Multi-provider servers that let you switch easily will become more valuable.

**Official servers coming.** OpenAI and Google are both investing heavily in MCP. Official image generation MCP servers from major providers are a matter of when, not if. When they arrive, most single-provider community wrappers will become obsolete overnight.

**Local inference maturing.** Flux models run well on consumer GPUs. As model sizes decrease and quality improves, local ComfyUI bridges will become increasingly competitive with cloud APIs — especially for teams with privacy requirements or high-volume workflows.

**Editing as a differentiator.** Text-to-image is becoming commoditized. The servers that survive will be the ones offering editing, refinement, and workflow integration beyond simple generation.
