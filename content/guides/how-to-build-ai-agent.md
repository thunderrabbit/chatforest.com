AI agents are software systems that use language models to observe their environment, make decisions, and take actions — repeatedly, in a loop, until a goal is met. Unlike a chatbot that responds to a single prompt, an agent can browse your codebase, run tests, fix failures, and open a pull request, all without you specifying each step.

Building one that works reliably is harder than it looks. The model is non-deterministic. Tools fail. Context windows overflow. Costs spiral. This guide covers what actually matters when building AI agents in 2026, based on research across the major frameworks, published production reports, and security research.

## The Agentic Loop

Every AI agent runs some variation of the same loop:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. OBSERVE  — Read environment     │
│  2. THINK    — Reason about state   │
│  3. ACT      — Call a tool or reply │
│  4. REFLECT  — Check the result     │
│  └──── Loop until goal is met ──────┘
```

The differences between agent architectures come down to how they implement each step.

### ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)

The most common pattern. The model alternates between reasoning ("I need to find the database configuration file") and acting (searching for the file). Each observation feeds back into the next reasoning step.

**Strengths:** Simple to implement, works well for straightforward tasks, supported by every major framework.

**Weaknesses:** Can get stuck in loops, doesn't plan ahead, token-expensive for complex tasks because it reasons step-by-step.

### Plan-and-Execute

The model creates a plan first, then executes each step. Published benchmarks show this pattern achieves roughly 92% task completion rates — significantly higher than ReAct on complex multi-step tasks.

```
Plan:
1. Read the failing test
2. Find the function it tests
3. Identify the bug
4. Fix the function
5. Run the test to verify

Execute each step...
```

**Strengths:** Better for complex tasks, more predictable behavior, easier to debug because you can inspect the plan.

**Weaknesses:** The initial plan may be wrong, replanning is expensive, overhead isn't worth it for simple tasks.

### Reflection

After completing a task (or failing), the model critiques its own output and tries again. Research shows this pattern can improve accuracy from roughly 80% to 91% on coding tasks.

**Strengths:** Catches errors the first pass missed, produces higher-quality output.

**Weaknesses:** At least doubles token cost, diminishing returns after 2-3 iterations, can over-correct.

### Which Pattern to Use

| Pattern | Best for | Avoid when |
|---------|----------|------------|
| ReAct | Simple tasks, quick interactions | Complex multi-step workflows |
| Plan-and-Execute | Complex projects, multi-file changes | Simple questions, time-sensitive tasks |
| Reflection | Code generation, writing, analysis | Budget-constrained tasks, real-time interactions |

Most production agents combine patterns — plan-and-execute for the overall structure, ReAct for individual steps, reflection for critical outputs.

## Tool Use: How Agents Interact with the World

An agent without tools is just a chatbot that talks to itself. Tools are what give agents the ability to read files, query databases, call APIs, and take real actions.

### The Model Context Protocol (MCP)

[MCP](/guides/what-is-mcp/) has become the standard protocol for connecting AI agents to tools. As of March 2026, the official SDKs see over 97 million monthly downloads. Every major AI coding tool supports it.

MCP provides:
- **A standard interface** — tools expose their capabilities via JSON-RPC, any compatible client can discover and call them
- **Dynamic discovery** — agents can find available tools at runtime instead of having them hardcoded
- **OAuth 2.1 authentication** — standardized [authorization for remote services](/guides/mcp-authorization-oauth/)
- **Transport flexibility** — [stdio for local tools, Streamable HTTP for remote ones](/guides/mcp-transports-explained/)

For a detailed comparison with alternatives, see our guide on [MCP vs function calling](/guides/mcp-vs-function-calling/) and [MCP vs CLI for AI agents](/guides/mcp-vs-cli-ai-agents/).

### When to Use MCP vs Direct API Calls

| Use MCP when... | Use direct APIs when... |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| You want dynamic tool discovery | You have a fixed, small tool set |
| Multiple agents share tools | Only one agent uses the tool |
| You need OAuth-based auth for remote services | Simple API key auth is sufficient |
| Non-technical users configure tools | Developers manage everything |
| You want protocol-level observability | You instrument at the application level |

The practical answer: if you're building an agent that needs to interact with more than 3-4 external services, MCP saves you from writing and maintaining custom integrations. For a single-purpose agent with one or two tools, direct API calls are simpler.

### Designing Good Tools

The quality of your tools determines the quality of your agent. Poorly designed tools are the number one cause of agent failures in production.

Key principles:
- **One tool, one job.** A `search_database` tool should search. A `write_record` tool should write. Don't combine them.
- **Clear descriptions matter more than you think.** The model reads tool descriptions to decide what to call. Vague descriptions lead to wrong tool choices.
- **Return structured data.** Don't return raw HTML or unformatted text. Return JSON that the model can parse reliably.
- **Fail clearly.** Return error messages that tell the model what went wrong and what to try instead.
- **Limit blast radius.** A tool that can delete your production database should require confirmation. Use [tool annotations](/guides/mcp-tool-annotations-explained/) to signal destructive operations.

For a deep dive, see our [MCP tool design patterns](/guides/mcp-tool-design-patterns/) guide.

## Memory: How Agents Remember

Context windows are large but not infinite. Claude Opus 4.6 offers 1M tokens, but most models give you 128K-200K. Either way, an agent that runs for hours will exceed its context window. Memory solves this.

### Short-Term Memory (Context Window)

Everything in the current conversation. It's fast and reliable but limited by the context window size. For short tasks, this is all you need.

**Optimization strategies:**
- Summarize completed subtasks instead of keeping full transcripts
- Use [MCP tool search](/guides/mcp-cost-optimization/) to load tool schemas on demand instead of upfront
- Remove tool results after the agent has processed them

### Long-Term Memory (Persistent Storage)

For agents that run across sessions — or need to recall information from days or weeks ago — you need persistent storage.

**Vector databases** (Pinecone, Qdrant, Chroma, Weaviate): Store embeddings of past interactions. Good for semantic search ("what did I discuss about the auth module?"). Less good for exact recall.

**Knowledge graphs** (Neo4j, Graphiti): Store structured relationships between entities. Better for reasoning about connections ("which services depend on the user service?"). See our [MCP knowledge graphs](/guides/mcp-knowledge-graphs/) guide.

**File-based memory** (CLAUDE.md, memory files, project notes): Store key decisions and context as plain text files that get loaded into the context window. Simple, inspectable, version-controlled. This is what tools like Claude Code use — see our guide on [writing effective CLAUDE.md files](/guides/writing-effective-claude-md-files/).

### Memory Frameworks

Several frameworks have emerged to handle agent memory:

| Framework | Approach | Stars | Best for |
|-----------|----------|-------|----------|
| Mem0 | Managed memory layer with auto-extraction | ~48K | Drop-in memory for any agent |
| Zep/Graphiti | Knowledge graph-based temporal memory | ~3K | Relationship-heavy domains |
| Letta (MemGPT) | Self-editing memory with tiered storage | ~14K | Long-running conversational agents |
| Cognee | Graph + vector hybrid | ~2K | RAG pipelines with structured data |

### The Practical Advice

Start with context window management. Most agent tasks don't need persistent memory. If they do, start with file-based memory (it's debuggable) and add vector search only when you have a specific retrieval problem to solve. Don't add a vector database because it sounds sophisticated.

## Choosing a Framework

You don't need a framework to build an agent — a loop that calls an LLM API and processes tool results is about 50 lines of code. But frameworks handle the boilerplate: conversation management, tool registration, error recovery, streaming, and multi-agent orchestration.

### The Major Frameworks in 2026

**Claude Agent SDK** (Anthropic) — Minimal, Python-based. Provides the agentic loop, tool use, guardrails, and handoffs between agents. Designed for Claude models. Best when you want close control over agent behavior without framework abstractions getting in the way.

**LangGraph** (LangChain) — Graph-based agent orchestration. Agents are defined as state machines with nodes (actions) and edges (transitions). The most flexible option for complex, multi-step workflows. Steeper learning curve.

**CrewAI** — Role-based multi-agent framework. You define agents with roles ("researcher", "writer", "reviewer") and they collaborate on tasks. Over 1 million monthly users. Best for multi-agent workflows where role specialization makes sense.

**OpenAI Agents SDK** — OpenAI's framework for building agents with their models. Lightweight, with built-in handoffs, guardrails, and tracing. Similar philosophy to Claude Agent SDK but tied to OpenAI's model ecosystem.

**Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** — Google's entry, tightly integrated with Gemini and Google Cloud. Supports MCP tools alongside native Google tool definitions.

**Mastra** — TypeScript-native agent framework. If your stack is JavaScript/TypeScript, this is the most natural fit. Good workflow engine, built-in MCP support.

**Pydantic AI** — Type-safe Python agent framework. Built on Pydantic for validation. Appeals to developers who want strong typing and structured outputs.

### How to Choose

| If you... | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Want minimal abstraction | Claude Agent SDK or OpenAI Agents SDK |
| Need complex state machines | LangGraph |
| Want role-based multi-agent | CrewAI |
| Build in TypeScript | Mastra |
| Want strong typing in Python | Pydantic AI |
| Are in the Google ecosystem | Google ADK |

**The honest take:** If you're building a single-agent system with Claude, you might not need a framework at all. The raw API with a loop and error handling gets you surprisingly far. Frameworks earn their keep when you need multi-agent orchestration, complex state management, or production observability.

For detailed MCP integration across frameworks, see our [MCP agent framework integrations](/guides/mcp-agent-framework-integrations/) guide.

## Multi-Agent Patterns

Sometimes one agent isn't enough. Complex tasks benefit from multiple specialized agents that coordinate through shared infrastructure. Gartner reported a 1,445% surge in enterprise inquiries about multi-agent systems in early 2026.

But multi-agent systems are harder to debug, more expensive to run, and introduce coordination problems that don't exist with single agents. Use them deliberately.

### Supervisor Pattern

One "manager" agent delegates tasks to specialist agents and synthesizes their results.

```
         ┌── Research Agent
Manager ─┼── Coding Agent
         └── Review Agent
```

**When to use:** Tasks that naturally decompose into distinct specialties. The manager handles coordination; workers handle execution.

### Pipeline Pattern

Agents process work sequentially, each adding to the output of the previous one.

```
Draft Agent → Review Agent → Edit Agent → Final Output
```

**When to use:** Content creation, data processing, any workflow where each stage transforms the previous stage's output.

### Swarm Pattern

Multiple identical agents work on pieces of the same problem in parallel.

```
         ┌── Agent (file1.py)
Splitter ┼── Agent (file2.py)  → Combiner
         └── Agent (file3.py)
```

**When to use:** Embarrassingly parallel tasks — migrating many files, reviewing multiple PRs, processing large datasets.

### When NOT to Use Multi-Agent

- The task is simple enough for one agent with good tools
- You can't clearly define the boundaries between agents
- You don't have the observability to debug coordination failures
- Cost is a concern (multi-agent multiplies your token usage)

For MCP-specific multi-agent patterns, see our [MCP multi-agent architectures](/guides/mcp-multi-agent-architectures/) guide.

## Testing and Evaluation

Agent testing is different from traditional software testing. The same input can produce different outputs. Success is often subjective. And the agent's behavior changes when you update the underlying model.

### What to Test

**Tool calls:** Does the agent call the right tools with the right arguments? This is the most deterministic part of agent behavior and the easiest to test.

**Task completion:** Given a well-defined task, does the agent achieve the goal? Use a set of benchmark tasks with clear success criteria.

**Safety boundaries:** Does the agent refuse to do things it shouldn't? Try to get it to exceed its permissions, access unauthorized data, or take destructive actions.

**Cost and latency:** Track tokens consumed and wall-clock time per task. Set budgets and alert when agents exceed them.

### Evaluation Approaches

**Trajectory evaluation:** Check that the agent took reasonable steps, not just that it got the right answer. An agent that deletes and recreates a file to fix a typo "works" but isn't good.

**LLM-as-judge:** Use a separate model to evaluate agent outputs. Research shows this correlates with human judgment when the evaluator model is strong enough (target Spearman correlation of 0.80+).

**Progressive gates:** Set quality thresholds at each stage:
- Development: 70% pass rate on benchmark tasks
- Staging: 85% pass rate with safety tests
- Production: 95% pass rate with human review on failures

### Existing Benchmarks

| Benchmark | What it tests | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| SWE-bench Verified | Real GitHub issues | The standard for coding agents; beware scaffolding effects |
| GAIA | General AI assistant tasks | Tests real-world tool use and reasoning |
| AgentBench | Multi-domain agent tasks | Covers OS, DB, web, and game environments |
| WebArena | Web browsing tasks | Tests agents that navigate real websites |

## Deploying Agents in Production

Getting an agent to work in a demo and running it reliably in production are very different challenges.

### Deployment Models

**Local agents** run on developer machines. Claude Code, Cursor, and similar tools work this way. No infrastructure to manage, but limited to a single user.

**Containerized agents** run in Docker or Kubernetes. Good for always-on agents that need to process work continuously. You manage scaling, monitoring, and restarts.

**Serverless agents** run on AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or similar platforms. Good for event-driven agents that respond to triggers. Cold starts can be a problem for interactive use.

**The 2026 pattern:** Most production teams use a hybrid approach — containerized agents for long-running work, serverless for event-driven triggers, local for development and testing.

### Production Checklist

**Observability:** You need to see what your agent is doing. At minimum, log every tool call, every LLM request, and every error. Use structured logging so you can query and aggregate.

Tools for agent observability include LangSmith, Braintrust, Arize Phoenix, Langfuse, and OpenTelemetry-based custom solutions. See our [MCP logging and observability](/guides/mcp-logging-observability/) guide.

**Cost controls:** Set per-task and per-day token budgets. A runaway agent loop can burn through hundreds of dollars in API credits. Most frameworks support max-iterations and max-tokens limits — use them.

**Rate limiting:** Both your rate limits with the LLM provider and rate limits on external services your tools call. Build backoff and retry logic into your tool implementations.

**Human-in-the-loop:** Decide which actions require human approval. Destructive operations (deleting data, sending emails, deploying code) should have a confirmation step. MCP's [elicitation feature](/guides/mcp-elicitation-explained/) supports this at the protocol level.

**Guardrails:** Input validation, output filtering, content moderation. Check what goes into the model and what comes out. The [MCP attack vectors](/guides/mcp-attack-vectors-defense/) guide covers the security side in detail.

**Error recovery:** Agents fail. Tools return errors. APIs go down. Models hallucinate. Build retry logic, fallback strategies, and graceful degradation. An agent that says "I couldn't complete this task because the database was unreachable" is better than one that silently produces wrong results.

## The Mistakes That Kill Agent Projects

Based on published post-mortems and production reports, these are the most common ways agent projects fail:

### 1. Over-Engineering from Day One

Building a multi-agent system with vector memory, knowledge graphs, and custom evaluation frameworks before you have a working single-agent prototype. Start with a simple loop and add complexity only when you hit specific limitations.

### 2. Poor Tool Design

Vague tool descriptions, tools that do too many things, tools that return unstructured data. The model can only be as good as the tools you give it. Invest time in tool descriptions and structured outputs.

### 3. Ignoring Cost

A single agent task can cost $0.50-$5.00 in API calls. At scale, that adds up fast. Profile your token usage early and optimize aggressively. See [MCP cost optimization](/guides/mcp-cost-optimization/).

### 4. No Guardrails

Agents connected to production systems without safety boundaries. A prompt injection in a fetched web page causes your agent to delete files. An over-eager agent sends emails to customers. Build permission boundaries and confirmation steps for anything with real-world consequences. See [MCP server security](/guides/mcp-server-security/).

### 5. Testing Only the Happy Path

Your agent works perfectly on the 10 examples you tried during development. It fails on the 11th because of an edge case in your tool implementation. Build diverse test sets that include failure modes, edge cases, and adversarial inputs.

### 6. Treating the Model as Deterministic

The same prompt can produce different results on different runs. Agent systems need to be robust to this variance — use structured outputs where possible, validate results, and don't build brittle pipelines that break when the model's output format varies slightly.

## What's Coming

The agent ecosystem is maturing fast. Key trends for the rest of 2026:

- **Protocol standardization** — MCP for tool access, [A2A for agent-to-agent communication](/guides/mcp-vs-a2a-protocol-comparison/). These protocols are converging into a standard stack.
- **Agent registries** — the [MCP Registry](/guides/mcp-registry-server-discovery/) and similar directories are making tools discoverable, with verification and trust signals.
- **Enterprise adoption** — Gartner predicts 40% of enterprise applications will embed AI agents by the end of 2026. The infrastructure (gateways, auth, audit) is catching up.
- **Better evaluation** — Agent benchmarks are getting more rigorous, but we're still far from being able to predict production performance from benchmark scores.
- **Cost reduction** — Models are getting cheaper and faster. Tasks that cost $5 in early 2025 cost $0.50 today. This trend will continue.

## Getting Started

If you're building your first agent:

1. **Pick a well-defined task** — not "build me an AI assistant" but "automatically triage incoming GitHub issues based on labels and past resolution patterns"
2. **Start with a single agent** — one model, a few tools, a simple loop
3. **Use MCP for tool access** — it'll save you from writing custom integrations as you add capabilities. Start with our [build your first MCP server](/guides/build-your-first-mcp-server/) guide.
4. **Add complexity incrementally** — memory when you need it, multi-agent when single-agent isn't enough, custom evaluation when you need confidence in quality
5. **Monitor everything** — log tool calls, token usage, task outcomes, and errors from day one

The technology is ready. The protocols are standardized. The hard part isn't building an agent that works once — it's building one that works reliably, safely, and affordably at scale.
