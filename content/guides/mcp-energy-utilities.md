Energy is the industry where AI integration carries the highest stakes and the most complex data landscape. A single utility might operate across generation (coal, gas, nuclear, solar, wind), transmission (high-voltage lines, substations), distribution (transformers, smart meters, outage management), and retail (billing, demand response, customer programs) — each layer with its own protocols, data formats, regulatory requirements, and security constraints. Add building energy management, electric vehicle charging, carbon accounting, and commodity trading, and you have an ecosystem where data fragmentation isn't just inconvenient — it's the fundamental barrier to intelligent operations.

The market reflects both the opportunity and the challenge. AI in energy reached an estimated $11–18 billion in 2025, with projections ranging from $42 billion to $75 billion by 2033–2034 at 17–30% CAGR. Yet adoption lags behind other industries — only 33% of energy and utilities companies have deployed AI (below the 42% cross-industry average), and a striking 71% of energy AI initiatives remain stuck in pilot phase, the highest of any sector except government. Meanwhile, 58% of energy operations staff distrust AI-generated recommendations. The technology opportunity is clear; the integration challenge is what's holding adoption back.

MCP provides a structured protocol for connecting AI assistants to energy data sources and control systems. Rather than building custom integrations for every grid operator, building management system, solar inverter, battery controller, and commodity data feed, MCP-connected agents can query power system models, monitor building energy consumption, track carbon intensity, access grid pricing, and analyze equipment data — all through defined tool interfaces with consistent authentication and data formats.

This guide covers the energy and utilities MCP ecosystem — power system simulation, building energy modeling, smart home energy monitoring, solar and battery storage, grid carbon intelligence, oil and gas data, EV charging, industrial IoT and SCADA, and architecture patterns for AI-assisted energy management. Our analysis draws on published documentation, open-source repositories, vendor announcements, and energy industry reporting — we research and analyze rather than deploying these systems ourselves.

## Why Energy Needs MCP

Energy has characteristics that make standardized AI integration both high-value and uniquely challenging:

**Protocol fragmentation defines the industry.** Energy systems communicate through dozens of specialized protocols — IEC 61850 for substation automation, DNP3 for SCADA, Modbus for industrial devices, OpenADR for demand response, OCPP for EV chargers, BACnet for building automation, Green Button for customer data, CIM (IEC 61970) for grid modeling. No AI model speaks these natively. MCP servers that translate these protocols into standard tool calls make AI-assisted energy operations practical.

**Critical infrastructure demands safety constraints.** Unlike most software domains, incorrect actions in energy systems can cause physical harm — equipment damage, grid instability, safety hazards. AI integration must enforce read-only defaults, explicit escalation for control actions, audit trails, and regulatory compliance. MCP's structured tool definitions enable fine-grained permission models that general-purpose APIs don't provide.

**Time scales span milliseconds to decades.** Grid frequency regulation happens in milliseconds, demand response in minutes, load forecasting in hours, capacity planning in years. AI agents need access to real-time operational data, historical archives, and forward-looking forecasts simultaneously — often from different systems with different access patterns.

**Regulation varies by jurisdiction and changes frequently.** NERC CIP standards govern bulk power systems in North America, GDPR affects European utility customer data, state-level net metering rules change annually, and carbon reporting requirements differ across regions. AI agents that can query jurisdiction-specific regulatory databases through MCP provide more reliable guidance than general-purpose models.

**Decarbonization is reshaping every layer.** The transition from centralized fossil generation to distributed renewables, battery storage, and electrified transport is fundamentally changing how grids operate. AI agents that can simultaneously access solar production forecasts, battery state-of-charge, EV charging demand, and grid carbon intensity through MCP enable the real-time optimization this transition requires.

## Power System Simulation

The most technically mature energy MCP servers wrap established power system simulation tools, enabling AI agents to run grid analyses that previously required specialized engineering software.

### PowerMCP

**Power-Agent/PowerMCP** | **93 stars** | **MIT** | **Python**

PowerMCP is an open-source collection of 10 MCP servers, each wrapping a different power system simulation tool. This makes it the most comprehensive power engineering MCP project available.

**Supported simulation tools:**
- **PowerWorld** — commercial power flow and contingency analysis
- **OpenDSS** — distribution system simulation (open-source, EPRI)
- **PSS/E (PSSE)** — transmission planning and stability analysis (Siemens)
- **pandapower** — open-source power system modeling in Python
- **PyPSA** — Python for Power System Analysis (open-source)
- **ANDES** — power system dynamics simulation
- **Egret** — ARPA-E security-constrained economic dispatch
- **PSLF** — GE positive sequence load flow
- **PSCAD** — electromagnetic transient simulation
- **LTSpice** — circuit simulation

**What it enables:**
- Automated power flow analysis across different software platforms
- Contingency evaluation — what happens if a transmission line trips?
- Load growth scenario assessment — how does the grid handle increasing demand?
- Professional report generation from simulation results
- Secure data exchange between AI agents and power system models

Video demonstrations show LLMs autonomously operating PowerWorld and pandapower — running simulations, analyzing results, and generating reports without manual intervention. For power system engineers, this transforms hours of click-through analysis into conversational queries.

### EnergyPlus-MCP (Lawrence Berkeley National Lab)

**LBNL-ETA/EnergyPlus-MCP** | **77 stars** | **DOE/LBNL License** | **Python** | **35 tools**

The first open-source MCP server for EnergyPlus, developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and published as an academic paper on ScienceDirect. EnergyPlus is the U.S. Department of Energy's flagship building energy simulation engine, used globally for building performance analysis and code compliance.

**Tool categories (35 tools across 5 groups):**

| Category | Tools | Capabilities |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Model Config & Loading | 9 | Load IDF files, configure weather data, set simulation parameters |
| Model Inspection | 9 | Analyze thermal zones, surfaces, materials, schedules, HVAC topology |
| Model Modification | 8 | Change building parameters, materials, schedules, systems |
| Simulation & Results | 4 | Run simulations, retrieve results, manage output variables |
| Server Management | 5 | Server status, configuration, session management |

**Key capabilities:**
- Complete building energy model lifecycle from loading to simulation
- Deep building analysis — thermal zones, surface properties, material layers, schedule definitions
- HVAC system topology discovery — understanding complex mechanical systems
- Automated simulations with weather files for any global location
- Interactive HTML visualizations of results
- Output variable management for custom energy metrics

For architects, mechanical engineers, and energy consultants, this means AI-assisted building performance analysis — asking questions like "what happens to annual energy consumption if I change the wall insulation from R-13 to R-21?" and getting simulation-backed answers rather than estimates.

## Smart Home and Building Energy

Smart home platforms provide the most accessible entry point for energy-aware AI agents, with Home Assistant's MCP ecosystem being by far the most developed.

### Home Assistant MCP (Official)

**homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp** | **1,800 stars** | **MIT** | **Python** | **96 tools**

Home Assistant is the dominant open-source smart home platform, and its MCP server is one of the most popular across any domain. With 96 tools covering device control, automation management, and data queries, it provides comprehensive access to any energy device connected to a Home Assistant instance.

- **Energy-saving suggestions** based on actual usage data
- **Daytime lighting waste identification** — lights on when natural light suffices
- **Window/heating conflict detection** — open windows while heating is running
- **Thermostat control** with mode selection (heat, cool, auto, off)
- **Fan speed control** for HVAC optimization

The distinction from the official HA MCP is the analytical layer — rather than just exposing device controls, it actively identifies energy waste patterns and suggests optimizations.

### Other Home Assistant MCP Servers

Several additional HA MCP servers provide energy-relevant functionality:

- **zorak1103/ha-mcp** — 38 specialized tools with entity queries and automation management
- **coffeerunhobby/mcp-ha-connect** — focused climate control (temperature, HVAC modes, fan speeds, humidity targets)
- **yayoboy/Claude-Desktop-HA** — 6+ tools for sensor monitoring, statistics, and energy history

## Solar and Battery Storage

Residential and commercial solar with battery storage represents one of the fastest-growing energy segments, and several vendor-specific MCP servers have emerged.

## Architecture Patterns

Energy MCP deployments follow several distinct integration patterns, reflecting the diversity of energy use cases.

### Pattern 1: Protocol Translation Gateway

For organizations operating physical grid infrastructure, the core challenge is translating between AI's natural language interface and the specialized protocols that energy equipment speaks.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              AI Assistant (Claude)                │
│         "What's the battery state of charge?"    │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘

                   ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

  ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐
  │  DR       │ │ EV       │  │  Substation /    │
  │ Programs  │ │ Chargers │  │  Battery / Solar │
  └──────────┘ └──────────┘  └──────────────────┘
```

EnergyAtIt exemplifies this pattern — translating 8 grid protocols into MCP tool calls. The AI agent speaks MCP; the server speaks whatever protocol each device requires. This abstraction layer means adding support for a new protocol doesn't change the AI agent's interface.

### Pattern 2: Simulation and Analysis Gateway

For engineering teams, MCP servers wrap simulation software to enable AI-driven analysis without requiring expertise in each tool's interface.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

   │  Files   │  │  Models  │  │  (IDF/EPW)   │
   └──────────┘  └──────────┘  └──────────────┘
```

PowerMCP wraps 10 different simulation tools, and EnergyPlus-MCP provides 35 tools for building energy modeling. An engineer can ask questions in natural language and get simulation-backed answers — the MCP server handles translating the query into the correct software commands, running the simulation, and returning formatted results.

### Pattern 3: Carbon-Aware Compute Scheduling

For data center operators and cloud workloads, MCP servers enable real-time carbon optimization by matching flexible compute to the greenest available grid region.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐

   └──────────┘ └──────┘ └──────┘
```

MCP Energy Hub covers 7 US grid regions with real-time carbon intensity data, generation mix visibility, and data center energy estimates. The `get_best_region_for_compute` tool directly returns the greenest option for flexible workloads.

### Pattern 4: Home Energy Intelligence

For residential energy management, multiple MCP servers combine to give AI agents comprehensive visibility into home energy production, consumption, storage, and grid interaction.

The combination is powerful: Home Assistant provides device-level control and automation, solar/battery MCP servers provide generation and storage data, and energy monitors provide consumption analytics. An AI agent with access to all three can identify that the bill increase correlates with a heat pump running more frequently due to a thermostat schedule change — a connection that no single system could make alone.

## Security and Critical Infrastructure

Energy is critical infrastructure, and AI integration introduces security considerations that go beyond typical software deployments.

### NERC CIP Compliance

North American bulk power systems operate under NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards. Key requirements affecting MCP deployments:

- **CIP-015-1** (effective September 2025) mandates Internal Network Security Monitoring within Electronic Security Perimeters — any MCP server touching BES (Bulk Electric System) assets must be within monitored network boundaries
- **High-impact BES systems** must comply by October 2028; medium-impact by October 2030
- AI tools must produce **audit-quality evidence** of every decision they influenced — MCP's structured tool call logs help, but organizations must ensure complete capture

### ICS/SCADA Threat Landscape

The 2025–2026 threat environment for industrial control systems is severe:

- **2,451 ICS vulnerabilities** disclosed in the 12 months through November 2025 — nearly double the prior year's 1,690
- HMIs and web-based SCADA interfaces are the most frequently targeted attack vectors
- Manufacturing and energy are the top two affected sectors
- **VoltRuptor** — sophisticated ICS/SCADA malware with multi-protocol support appeared on dark web markets
- Nation-state actors are expected to exploit AI integration gaps to target critical infrastructure

### Mitigation Strategies for Energy MCP Deployments

**1. Read-only by default.** Energy MCP servers should default to monitoring and analysis. Control actions (battery dispatch, inverter commands, demand response execution) should require explicit escalation — a separate authentication step, supervisor approval, or time-limited authorization tokens.

**2. Containerized and segmented deployment.** MCP servers should run in containers on managed infrastructure, not on user workstations. For OT/SCADA environments, air-gapped or network-segmented deployments prevent AI-initiated actions from reaching production control systems without crossing monitored boundaries.

**3. Centralized credential management.** Per-user OAuth flows through organizational identity providers — not user-managed API keys. The IoT-Edge-MCP-Server's approach (API key auth, JWT tokens, IP allowlisting, rate limiting) provides a reference implementation.

**4. Tamper-evident audit trails.** Every tool call should be logged with HMAC verification, as IoT-Edge-MCP-Server implements. For NERC CIP compliance, these logs must be retained for the required period and available for regulatory audit.

**5. Protocol-aware security.** MCP servers that translate grid protocols (IEC 61850, DNP3, Modbus) must validate commands against safety constraints before execution. A malformed Modbus write to a protection relay could have physical safety consequences.

**6. Supply chain vigilance.** CVE-2025-6514 demonstrated that MCP ecosystem tools can contain OS command injection vulnerabilities — the affected `mcp-remote` package had 437,000 downloads. Energy organizations should audit MCP server dependencies and pin versions.

**7. Distrust as a feature.** The 58% of energy operations staff who distrust AI recommendations represent healthy skepticism. MCP deployments should support human-in-the-loop patterns — AI recommends, human approves, system executes — especially for control actions with physical consequences.

## Ecosystem Gaps

Several significant gaps remain in the energy MCP ecosystem:

**No MLS-equivalent for energy data.** Unlike real estate (where MLS standardizes listings), energy lacks a standardized MCP server for utility customer data. Green Button CMD (the industry standard for customer energy data sharing) has no MCP wrapper — a significant opportunity given that every US utility is required to provide Green Button data.

**Thin wholesale market coverage.** No MCP server covers wholesale electricity markets (PJM capacity auctions, ERCOT real-time pricing, CAISO day-ahead markets). The EIA server provides historical data, but real-time market access would enable AI-assisted energy trading.

**No CIM/grid model server.** The Common Information Model (IEC 61970) is the standard for power system data exchange between GIS, ADMS, and SCADA systems. An MCP server wrapping CIM would enable AI agents to work with standardized grid models.

**Limited building automation beyond Home Assistant.** Commercial building automation (BACnet, LonWorks, KNX) lacks dedicated MCP servers. The IoT-Edge-MCP-Server handles Modbus and MQTT, but purpose-built building automation MCP servers are missing.

**No utility billing/customer platform.** Utility customer information systems (CIS), billing platforms, and customer engagement tools have no MCP representation. This is a large potential market given utility industry digitization trends.

## Getting Started

Recommendations based on your role:

**Home energy enthusiast:** Start with [Home Assistant MCP](https://github.com/homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp) — if you already use HA, the MCP server gives AI access to all your energy data. Add Emporia or Powerwall MCP for detailed solar/battery monitoring.

**Power system engineer:** [PowerMCP](https://github.com/Power-Agent/PowerMCP) wraps the simulation tools you already use. Start with the pandapower or OpenDSS server for open-source workflows, or the PowerWorld server if you're licensed.

**Building energy analyst:** [EnergyPlus-MCP](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/EnergyPlus-MCP) from LBNL provides 35 tools for building performance analysis. The academic paper backing it provides validation that other MCP servers lack.

**Sustainability/carbon analyst:** [Climatiq MCP](https://github.com/jagan-shanmugam/climatiq-mcp-server) for emissions calculations, [MCP Energy Hub](https://github.com/karthikravva/MCP-Energy-Hub) for grid carbon intelligence, and the EIA MCP server for US energy statistics.

**Industrial/operations engineer:** [IoT-Edge-MCP-Server](https://github.com/poly-mcp/IoT-Edge-MCP-Server) provides the most production-ready SCADA/PLC integration with proper security controls. Its HMAC audit trail and multi-layer authentication make it suitable for environments where compliance matters.

**Energy data analyst/researcher:** The [MCP Energy Server (EIA)](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/ebarros23-mcp-energy) provides conversational access to the most comprehensive US energy data source. Combine with OilPriceAPI for commodity prices.
