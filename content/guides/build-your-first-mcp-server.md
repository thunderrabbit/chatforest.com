You've read about [what MCP is](/guides/what-is-mcp/). Now let's build something. By the end of this guide, you'll have a working MCP server that exposes custom tools to Claude Desktop. We'll use Python because the SDK is clean and the code is readable — but the concepts apply to TypeScript too.

## What You'll Build

A weather lookup server. It won't call a real weather API (that would require API keys and distract from the MCP concepts), but it will demonstrate everything you need:

- **Tools** — functions Claude can call
- **Input validation** — typed parameters with descriptions
- **Error handling** — what happens when things go wrong
- **Claude Desktop integration** — connecting your server to a real client

The server is intentionally simple. The point isn't the weather data — it's understanding the pattern so you can wrap *your* API, database, or service.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer
- `uv` (recommended) or `pip` for package management
- Claude Desktop (to test your server)

## Step 1: Set Up the Project

Create a new directory and install the MCP Python SDK:

```bash
mkdir weather-mcp && cd weather-mcp
uv init
uv add mcp
```

If you're using pip instead of uv:

```bash
mkdir weather-mcp && cd weather-mcp
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install mcp
```

## Step 2: Write the Server

Create `server.py`:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

# Create the server
mcp = FastMCP("weather")

# Sample weather data (in a real server, this would call an API)
WEATHER_DATA = {
    "london": {"temp_c": 12, "condition": "Cloudy", "humidity": 78},
    "tokyo": {"temp_c": 22, "condition": "Clear", "humidity": 45},
    "new york": {"temp_c": 18, "condition": "Partly cloudy", "humidity": 62},
    "sydney": {"temp_c": 26, "condition": "Sunny", "humidity": 55},
    "paris": {"temp_c": 14, "condition": "Rainy", "humidity": 85},
}


@mcp.tool()
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get the current weather for a city.

    Args:
        city: The city name (e.g., "London", "Tokyo")
    """
    city_lower = city.lower().strip()
    data = WEATHER_DATA.get(city_lower)

    if not data:
        available = ", ".join(WEATHER_DATA.keys())
        return f"No weather data for '{city}'. Available cities: {available}"

    return (
        f"Weather in {city.title()}:\n"
        f"  Temperature: {data['temp_c']}°C\n"
        f"  Condition: {data['condition']}\n"
        f"  Humidity: {data['humidity']}%"
    )


@mcp.tool()
def list_cities() -> str:
    """List all cities with available weather data."""
    return "Available cities: " + ", ".join(
        name.title() for name in WEATHER_DATA
    )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

That's the whole server. Let's break down what's happening:

- `FastMCP("weather")` creates a server named "weather." The name shows up in client UIs.
- `@mcp.tool()` registers a function as an MCP tool. The SDK reads the function signature and docstring to generate the tool's schema automatically.
- The type hints (`city: str`) become the tool's input schema. The docstring becomes the tool's description — this is what the AI model reads to decide when and how to use the tool.
- `mcp.run()` starts the server and handles the JSON-RPC protocol over stdio.

## Step 3: Test It Locally

Before connecting to Claude Desktop, verify the server runs without errors:

```bash
# With uv:
uv run python server.py

# With pip/venv:
python server.py
```

The server will start and wait for JSON-RPC messages on stdin. It won't print anything visible — that's normal. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop it.

For a better testing experience, use the MCP Inspector — a web-based tool that lets you interact with your server visually:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run python server.py
```

This opens a browser UI where you can see your tools, call them with test inputs, and inspect the JSON-RPC messages. It's invaluable during development.

## Step 4: Connect to Claude Desktop

Open your Claude Desktop config file:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add your server. If using uv:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weather": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/full/path/to/weather-mcp", "python", "server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

If using a venv with pip:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weather": {
      "command": "/full/path/to/weather-mcp/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/full/path/to/weather-mcp/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. You should see the hammer icon in the chat input. Click it to verify your `get_weather` and `list_cities` tools appear.

Now try: "What's the weather like in Tokyo?" Claude will call your tool and incorporate the result.

## Step 5: Add a Resource

Tools are functions the model *calls*. Resources are data the model can *read*. Let's add a resource that exposes a weather summary:

```python
@mcp.resource("weather://summary")
def weather_summary() -> str:
    """A summary of weather across all available cities."""
    lines = []
    for city, data in WEATHER_DATA.items():
        lines.append(f"{city.title()}: {data['temp_c']}°C, {data['condition']}")
    return "\n".join(lines)
```

Add this to your `server.py` before the `if __name__` block. Resources are identified by URIs (here, `weather://summary`). Clients can read them without the model needing to make a tool call — useful for context that should be available upfront.

## Step 6: Handle Errors Gracefully

When wrapping real APIs, things fail. Here's the pattern:

```python
@mcp.tool()
def get_forecast(city: str, days: int = 3) -> str:
    """Get a weather forecast for a city.

    Args:
        city: The city name
        days: Number of days to forecast (1-7, default 3)
    """
    if days < 1 or days > 7:
        return "Error: days must be between 1 and 7"

    city_lower = city.lower().strip()
    if city_lower not in WEATHER_DATA:
        available = ", ".join(WEATHER_DATA.keys())
        return f"No data for '{city}'. Available: {available}"

    # In a real server, you'd call a forecast API here
    data = WEATHER_DATA[city_lower]
    return f"{days}-day forecast for {city.title()}: {data['condition']}, ~{data['temp_c']}°C"
```

Key principle: **return error messages as strings, don't raise exceptions.** The model can read and react to a string error. An unhandled exception crashes the tool call and gives the model nothing useful to work with.

## The Complete Server

Here's the full `server.py` with everything we've built:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("weather")

WEATHER_DATA = {
    "london": {"temp_c": 12, "condition": "Cloudy", "humidity": 78},
    "tokyo": {"temp_c": 22, "condition": "Clear", "humidity": 45},
    "new york": {"temp_c": 18, "condition": "Partly cloudy", "humidity": 62},
    "sydney": {"temp_c": 26, "condition": "Sunny", "humidity": 55},
    "paris": {"temp_c": 14, "condition": "Rainy", "humidity": 85},
}


@mcp.tool()
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get the current weather for a city.

    Args:
        city: The city name (e.g., "London", "Tokyo")
    """
    city_lower = city.lower().strip()
    data = WEATHER_DATA.get(city_lower)

    if not data:
        available = ", ".join(WEATHER_DATA.keys())
        return f"No weather data for '{city}'. Available cities: {available}"

    return (
        f"Weather in {city.title()}:\n"
        f"  Temperature: {data['temp_c']}°C\n"
        f"  Condition: {data['condition']}\n"
        f"  Humidity: {data['humidity']}%"
    )


@mcp.tool()
def list_cities() -> str:
    """List all cities with available weather data."""
    return "Available cities: " + ", ".join(
        name.title() for name in WEATHER_DATA
    )


@mcp.tool()
def get_forecast(city: str, days: int = 3) -> str:
    """Get a weather forecast for a city.

    Args:
        city: The city name
        days: Number of days to forecast (1-7, default 3)
    """
    if days < 1 or days > 7:
        return "Error: days must be between 1 and 7"

    city_lower = city.lower().strip()
    if city_lower not in WEATHER_DATA:
        available = ", ".join(WEATHER_DATA.keys())
        return f"No data for '{city}'. Available: {available}"

    data = WEATHER_DATA[city_lower]
    return f"{days}-day forecast for {city.title()}: {data['condition']}, ~{data['temp_c']}°C"


@mcp.resource("weather://summary")
def weather_summary() -> str:
    """A summary of weather across all available cities."""
    lines = []
    for city, data in WEATHER_DATA.items():
        lines.append(f"{city.title()}: {data['temp_c']}°C, {data['condition']}")
    return "\n".join(lines)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

## Where to Go from Here

You now know the pattern. Every MCP server follows the same shape:

1. Create a `FastMCP` instance
2. Decorate functions with `@mcp.tool()` or `@mcp.resource()`
3. Call `mcp.run()`

What changes is what's inside the functions. Some ideas for your next server:

- **Database query server** — expose read-only SQL queries as tools
- **Internal API wrapper** — let AI agents interact with your company's services
- **File processor** — parse CSVs, transform data, generate reports
- **Notification server** — send Slack messages, create Jira tickets, trigger webhooks

The MCP Python SDK has more features we didn't cover — prompts, streaming, context management, and HTTP transport for remote servers. The [official MCP docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) are the best reference once you've got the basics down.

Build something, publish it to GitHub, and let us know — we might review it.
