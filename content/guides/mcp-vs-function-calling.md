Developers evaluating MCP often ask the same question: "How is this different from function calling?" It's a fair question. Both let LLMs invoke external tools. Both use structured JSON. Both result in the model deciding what to call and with what arguments.

But they operate at different layers. Function calling is an API feature built into LLM providers. MCP is an open protocol for standardizing how tools are discovered, exposed, and executed. Understanding where each fits — and how they work together — is key to building AI applications that scale.

## How Function Calling Works

Native function calling (called "tool use" in Claude, "function calling" in OpenAI and Gemini) embeds tool definitions directly into LLM API requests. The workflow:

1. **Define tools** — You send JSON schemas describing your functions in the `tools` parameter of the API request
2. **Model decides** — The LLM analyzes the user's query and returns a structured JSON response indicating which function to call and with what arguments
3. **You execute** — Your application code runs the function locally, in-process
4. **Return results** — You send the function output back to the model for further processing

Everything runs in a single process. Tool logic, credentials, and error handling all live in your application code.

**Example flow with Claude's tool use:**

```json
// 1. Send tool definitions with your request
{
  "tools": [{
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Get current weather for a location",
    "input_schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "location": { "type": "string" }
      }
    }
  }]
}

// 2. Model responds with a tool_use content block
{
  "type": "tool_use",
  "name": "get_weather",
  "input": { "location": "Tokyo" }
}

// 3. Your code executes get_weather("Tokyo")
// 4. You send the result back as a tool_result message
```

Each LLM provider implements this differently. OpenAI returns `message.tool_calls` with serialized JSON string arguments. Anthropic uses `content[]` blocks with `tool_use` type and inline input objects. Gemini uses `functionCall` with flat `args`. Switching providers means rewriting your parsing logic.

## How MCP Works

MCP uses a client-server architecture with three components:

- **MCP Host** — The AI application (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, your custom agent)
- **MCP Client** — Maintains a 1:1 connection with an MCP server
- **MCP Server** — A separate process exposing tools, resources, and prompts through a standardized JSON-RPC 2.0 interface

The workflow:

1. **Connect** — The MCP client connects to one or more MCP servers
2. **Discover tools** — The client calls `tools/list` to dynamically discover available tools
3. **Forward to LLM** — Tool definitions are sent to the model (as function calling schemas)
4. **Model decides** — The LLM returns a tool call, just like regular function calling
5. **Route and execute** — The MCP client routes the call to the appropriate MCP server, which executes it
6. **Return results** — Results flow back through the client to the model

Here's the key insight: **the LLM itself doesn't know about MCP.** From the model's perspective, it's still doing function calling. MCP operates at the infrastructure layer beneath the model, standardizing how tools are discovered, managed, and executed.

Transport options include **stdio** for local servers (near-zero overhead) and **Streamable HTTP** for remote servers (with OAuth 2.1 support).

## Key Differences at a Glance

| Aspect | Function Calling | MCP |
|--------|-----------------|-----|
| **What it is** | Provider-specific API feature | Open, provider-agnostic protocol |
| **Where tools live** | Embedded in application code | Separate server processes |
| **Who executes** | Your application (in-process) | MCP server (separate process/machine) |
| **Tool discovery** | Static — defined at request time | Dynamic — `tools/list` + change notifications |
| **Portability** | Vendor-locked per provider | Write once, use with any MCP client |
| **Credential handling** | All credentials in your app | Isolated per-server, least privilege |
| **Reusability** | Tools tied to one application | Same server works across all MCP clients |
| **Scaling model** | N models × M tools (quadratic) | Tools are independent services (linear) |

## The Portability Problem Function Calling Creates

Each LLM provider has its own function calling format. When you build tool integrations with native function calling, you're coupling your tool logic to a specific provider's API shape.

A GitHub integration built for OpenAI's function calling format won't work with Claude's tool use without modification. Multiply that across 10 tools and 3 providers, and you're maintaining 30 integration points.

MCP eliminates this. You build a GitHub MCP server once, and it works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, OpenAI's Agents SDK, and any other MCP-compatible client. The MCP client handles translating between MCP's standardized format and whatever the LLM provider expects.

This is why both Anthropic and OpenAI co-founded the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) under the Linux Foundation in December 2025 — to steward MCP as a shared standard.

## When to Use Function Calling

Function calling is the right choice when:

- **Quick prototypes** — You have 2-5 tools and want to ship fast
- **Single provider** — You're committed to one LLM and don't plan to switch
- **Latency-critical paths** — In-process execution saves a process hop
- **Simple, well-defined tasks** — Data extraction, structured output, ticket categorization
- **Project-specific tools** — Logic that won't be reused elsewhere

Function calling keeps things simple. No additional infrastructure, no protocol overhead, no server processes to manage.

## When to Use MCP

MCP makes sense when:

- **Production systems with 10+ tools** — MCP's dynamic discovery and independent deployment pay off at scale
- **Multi-provider support** — You need tools that work regardless of which LLM you're using
- **Shared infrastructure** — Multiple teams or applications need the same tool integrations
- **Security requirements** — Credential isolation and least-privilege access matter
- **Independent tool lifecycle** — Tools need to be versioned, deployed, and updated separately from the host application
- **Ecosystem participation** — Your tools should work in Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, ChatGPT, and future clients

## How They Work Together

MCP and function calling are complementary layers, not competitors:

- **Function calling = Intent** — The LLM expresses what it wants to do via structured JSON
- **MCP = Execution infrastructure** — Standardizes how those requests get routed and executed

In practice, MCP sits beneath function calling. When a model connected to MCP servers makes a tool call, it's using function calling to express intent. The MCP client then handles routing that intent to the right server for execution.

**OpenAI's implementation makes this explicit.** Their Responses API supports a native `mcp` tool type that sits alongside other tools:

```python
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[
        {  # Native function calling
            "type": "function",
            "name": "categorize_ticket",
            "parameters": { ... }
        },
        {  # MCP server
            "type": "mcp",
            "server_label": "github",
            "server_url": "https://mcp.github.com/sse",
            "require_approval": "always"
        }
    ],
    input="Create a GitHub issue for this bug report"
)
```

The model sees both native functions and MCP-discovered tools in the same tool list. It doesn't care where a tool comes from — it just picks the right one.

### The Typical Evolution Path

Many projects follow a natural progression:

1. **Start with function calling** — Prototype with a few inline tools
2. **Extract to MCP** — As tools mature and stabilize, package them as MCP servers
3. **Reuse across projects** — The same MCP servers work in your CLI agent, web app, and IDE plugin
4. **Switch providers freely** — Swap Claude for GPT or Gemini without rewriting tool integrations

## Performance and Cost Considerations

**Latency:**
- Function calling adds zero infrastructure overhead — tools execute in-process
- MCP via stdio (local servers) adds roughly 5-10ms per call for the process hop
- MCP via Streamable HTTP (remote servers) adds network latency on top

For most applications, MCP's latency overhead is negligible compared to LLM inference time (which dominates at 1-10+ seconds).

**Token overhead:**
This is where MCP costs can surprise you. Every connected MCP server's tool definitions get sent to the model as part of the prompt. A setup with 5 servers and 58 tools can consume approximately 55,000 tokens before the conversation even starts. Adding a single complex server like Jira can add 17,000+ tokens.

Mitigations exist:
- **Deferred tool loading** — Anthropic's Tool Search Tool (`defer_loading: true`) discovers tools on-demand instead of loading all definitions upfront
- **Response caching** — OpenAI caches `tools/list` results via `previous_response_id`
- **Selective connection** — Only connect the MCP servers needed for the current task

**Integration complexity:**
Without MCP, connecting N models to M tools requires N × M integration points (quadratic growth). With MCP, you build M servers once and each of the N models connects through the standard protocol (linear growth). At scale, MCP dramatically reduces maintenance burden.

## Real-World Adoption

MCP adoption has accelerated since its November 2024 launch:

- **GitHub's MCP server** provides 20+ tools for PRs, issues, and code search
- **Notion, Figma, Slack, and AWS** all maintain official MCP servers
- **OpenAI's Agents SDK** supports both function calling and MCP in the same agent
- **Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, and Windsurf** are MCP-native development environments
- **GitMCP** (gitmcp.io) automatically creates MCP servers for any GitHub repository

The ecosystem is still maturing. Community quality varies — researchers have found security vulnerabilities in a significant portion of third-party MCP servers, and token overhead remains a practical concern. Our [How to Choose MCP Servers](/guides/how-to-choose-mcp-servers/) guide covers evaluation criteria.

## Decision Framework

Use this quick guide:

**Fewer than 5 tools + single provider + one app →** Function calling is simpler and sufficient.

**10+ tools + multi-provider + multiple consumers →** MCP provides the infrastructure to manage complexity.

**In between →** Start with function calling. Extract to MCP when you find yourself copying tool code between projects or needing to switch providers.

The good news: you don't have to choose one or the other. The two approaches work together naturally, and the industry is converging on using both — function calling for the model-tool interface, MCP for the tool infrastructure beneath it.
