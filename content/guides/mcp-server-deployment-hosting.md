Your MCP server runs fine on your laptop over stdio. Now you need it accessible remotely — for a team, a product, or a multi-agent system. That means picking a deployment target, switching to Streamable HTTP transport, and handling the production concerns that come with running a networked service.

This guide covers every major deployment option with working configurations. We assume you already have an MCP server built with FastMCP (Python) or the TypeScript SDK. If you're still on stdio, see our [migration guide](/guides/mcp-server-migration-stdio-to-http/) first.

## The Deployment Decision Tree

Before diving into platforms, here's how to pick:

| Scenario | Best fit | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Internal team tool, few users | VPS / self-hosted | Simple, cheap, full control |
| Variable traffic, pay-per-use | Serverless (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel) | No idle costs, auto-scaling |
| Enterprise, multi-service | Kubernetes | Session affinity, scaling policies, observability |
| Quick prototype, Docker-native | Docker + MCP Gateway | Isolation, easy config |
| Existing cloud infra | Cloud Run / ECS / Container Apps | Integrates with your stack |

The common thread: all remote deployments require **Streamable HTTP transport**. stdio is local-only — the client must launch the server as a subprocess on the same machine.

## Docker Deployment

Docker is the foundation for most deployment targets. Even if your final destination is Kubernetes or a cloud platform, you'll likely start with a Dockerfile.

### Python MCP Server

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

WORKDIR /app

RUN apt-get update -y && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ca-certificates && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

ENV PORT=8080
EXPOSE 8080

HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1

CMD ["uvicorn", "server:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8080"]
```

Your `requirements.txt`:

```
mcp>=1.0.0
fastmcp>=2.0.0
uvicorn>=0.30.0
```

And a minimal server with health check:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from starlette.responses import JSONResponse

mcp = FastMCP("my-server")

# Your tools here
@mcp.tool()
def hello(name: str) -> str:
    """Greet someone."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

app = mcp.streamable_http_app()

# Health check endpoint
@app.route("/health")
async def health(request):
    return JSONResponse({"status": "ok"})
```

### TypeScript MCP Server

```dockerfile
FROM node:22-slim AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json .
RUN npm ci --production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:22-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json .

ENV PORT=8080
EXPOSE 8080

HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD node -e "fetch('http://localhost:8080/health').then(r => r.ok ? process.exit(0) : process.exit(1))"

CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

### Docker Compose for Local Testing

```yaml
services:
  mcp-server:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - API_KEY=${API_KEY}
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3
```

### Docker MCP Gateway

Docker's open-source [MCP Gateway](https://github.com/docker/mcp-gateway) is worth knowing about. It runs MCP servers in isolated containers with restricted privileges, managing their lifecycle automatically:

```yaml
services:
  gateway:
    image: docker/mcp-gateway
    command: ["--transport=sse"]
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      - ~/.docker/mcp:/mcp
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

The Gateway handles container isolation, credential management, and transport translation. It's particularly useful when you want to run multiple MCP servers behind a single endpoint.

## Cloud Platform Deployment

### Google Cloud Run

Cloud Run is one of the simplest paths from Docker container to production URL. It handles HTTPS, auto-scaling (including scale-to-zero), and IAM authentication out of the box.

**Deploy from source:**

```bash
gcloud run deploy my-mcp-server \
    --source . \
    --region us-central1 \
    --allow-unauthenticated \
    --port 8080 \
    --min-instances 0 \
    --max-instances 10 \
    --timeout 3600
```

**Deploy from container:**

```bash
# Build and push
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/my-mcp-server

# Deploy
gcloud run deploy my-mcp-server \
    --image gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/my-mcp-server \
    --region us-central1 \
    --port 8080
```

**Key settings for MCP:**

- `--timeout 3600` — Increase from the default 300s. MCP sessions can be long-lived, especially with SSE streaming.
- `--min-instances 1` — Avoid cold starts for production servers. Set to 0 for dev/staging.
- `--session-affinity` — Enables sticky sessions, important if your MCP server is stateful.
- `--no-allow-unauthenticated` — Require IAM authentication. Callers need `roles/run.invoker`.

**Connecting from clients:**

After deployment, your MCP server is available at a URL like `https://my-mcp-server-abc123-uc.a.run.app/mcp`. Configure clients to use this URL with Streamable HTTP transport.

### AWS: Lambda vs ECS

**AWS Lambda** works for stateless MCP tools but has significant caveats:

- Cold starts of 3–5 seconds make interactive use painful
- Session management requires external state (DynamoDB)
- The community consensus (including the [aws-lambda-mcp-cookbook](https://github.com/ran-isenberg/aws-lambda-mcp-cookbook) author) is that Lambda MCP hosting is experimental, not production-ready

If you want to try it, MCPEngine generates Lambda handlers automatically:

```python
from mcpengine import MCPEngine

engine = MCPEngine()

@engine.tool()
def lookup(query: str) -> str:
    """Search the knowledge base."""
    return do_search(query)

# This creates a Lambda-compatible handler
handler = engine.get_lambda_handler()
```

**AWS ECS/Fargate** is the better AWS option for production MCP servers:

```bash
# Create task definition, service, and ALB
aws ecs create-service \
    --cluster mcp-cluster \
    --service-name my-mcp-server \
    --task-definition my-mcp-server:1 \
    --desired-count 2 \
    --launch-type FARGATE
```

Use an Application Load Balancer with sticky sessions enabled if your MCP server maintains state. ECS gives you persistent containers without cold start concerns.

### Azure Container Apps

Azure Container Apps offers a managed container platform with built-in MCP support:

```bash
az containerapp create \
    --name my-mcp-server \
    --resource-group mcp-rg \
    --image myregistry.azurecr.io/my-mcp-server:latest \
    --target-port 8080 \
    --ingress external \
    --min-replicas 0 \
    --max-replicas 10
```

Features relevant to MCP hosting:

- **Automatic HTTPS** with managed TLS certificates
- **Scale-to-zero** for cost efficiency
- **Session affinity** via `--sticky-sessions` flag
- **Microsoft Entra ID** integration for authentication
- **Dynamic sessions** — platform-managed sandboxed environments with Hyper-V isolation, useful for MCP servers that execute user code

Azure Functions also supports MCP via an extension (public preview), enabling serverless MCP hosting with .NET, Java, JavaScript, Python, and TypeScript.

## Serverless Deployment

Serverless platforms work well for **stateless** MCP servers — tools that take input, do work, and return results without maintaining conversation state.

### Cloudflare Workers

Cloudflare Workers have near-zero cold starts (~0ms) and run at 300+ edge locations, making them the fastest serverless option for MCP.

**Quick start:**

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest my-mcp-server \
    -- --template=cloudflare/ai/demos/remote-mcp-server
```

**Deploy:**

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

**Limitations:**

- 50ms CPU time per request (enough for most tool calls, not for heavy computation)
- No native binary execution
- 128MB memory limit

Workers are ideal for MCP servers that call APIs, transform data, or do lightweight processing.

### Vercel

Vercel's `@vercel/mcp-adapter` integrates MCP with Next.js and other Vercel-hosted frameworks:

```typescript
// app/api/mcp/route.ts
import { createMcpHandler } from "@vercel/mcp-adapter";
import { z } from "zod";

const handler = createMcpHandler(
  (server) => {
    server.tool("hello", { name: z.string() }, async ({ name }) => ({
      content: [{ type: "text", text: `Hello, ${name}!` }],
    }));
  },
  {
    capabilities: { tools: {} },
  }
);

export { handler as GET, handler as POST, handler as DELETE };
```

**Deploy:**

```bash
vercel --prod
```

**Important:** Disable Deployment Protection for the `/api/mcp` route, or MCP clients won't be able to connect.

Cold starts are 1–3 seconds on Vercel — acceptable for most use cases but noticeable in interactive scenarios.

### Serverless Design Considerations

Stateless tools (API calls, data transformations, lookups) work great on serverless. But if your MCP server needs to:

- **Maintain conversation context** — Use an external store (Redis, DynamoDB) keyed by `Mcp-Session-Id`
- **Stream large results** — Ensure the platform supports SSE (Cloudflare Workers and Vercel both do)
- **Run long operations** — Check platform timeout limits (Cloudflare: 30s, Vercel: varies by plan)

The MCP spec explicitly supports **stateless mode** — where the server doesn't track sessions at all. Each request is independent. This is the ideal pattern for serverless:

```python
mcp = FastMCP("my-server", stateless_http=True)
```

## Self-Hosted / VPS Deployment

A VPS gives you full control at low cost. A $5–10/month server can run multiple MCP servers for a small team.

### systemd Service

Create `/etc/systemd/system/mcp-server.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=MCP Server
After=network.target

[Service]
User=mcp
WorkingDirectory=/opt/mcp-server
ExecStart=/opt/mcp-server/venv/bin/uvicorn server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
Environment=MCP_API_KEY=your-key-here

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now mcp-server
```

### nginx Reverse Proxy with TLS

MCP connections can be long-lived (SSE streams, extended sessions). nginx needs specific settings to handle this properly.

`/etc/nginx/sites-available/mcp-server`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name mcp.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/mcp.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/mcp.example.com/privkey.pem;

    location /mcp {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Connection "";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # Critical for MCP: disable buffering for SSE streaming
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_cache off;
        chunked_transfer_encoding off;

        # Long timeouts for persistent MCP sessions
        proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
        proxy_send_timeout 86400s;
    }

    location /health {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name mcp.example.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
```

**Key nginx settings explained:**

- `proxy_buffering off` — Without this, nginx buffers SSE events and delivers them in batches, breaking real-time streaming.
- `proxy_http_version 1.1` + empty `Connection` header — Enables HTTP keep-alive for persistent connections.
- `proxy_read_timeout 86400s` — 24-hour timeout prevents nginx from dropping long-lived MCP sessions.
- `chunked_transfer_encoding off` — Prevents nginx from re-chunking SSE streams.

**TLS with Let's Encrypt:**

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d mcp.example.com
```

Certbot automatically configures renewal via systemd timer.

### Security Hardening for VPS

- **Bind to localhost only** — Your MCP server should listen on `127.0.0.1`, not `0.0.0.0`. Let nginx handle external connections.
- **Firewall** — Allow only ports 80, 443, and SSH. Block direct access to port 8080.
- **Origin validation** — The MCP spec requires servers to validate the `Origin` header to prevent DNS rebinding attacks.
- **Rate limiting** — Add `limit_req_zone` in nginx to prevent abuse.
- **Separate user** — Run the MCP server as a dedicated non-root user with minimal permissions.

## Kubernetes Deployment

For teams already running Kubernetes, MCP servers fit naturally as deployments with services.

### Basic Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mcp-server
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mcp-server
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mcp-server
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mcp-server
          image: myregistry/mcp-server:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
          env:
            - name: API_KEY
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: mcp-secrets
                  key: api-key
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 10
            periodSeconds: 30
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
            periodSeconds: 10
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 100m
              memory: 256Mi
            limits:
              cpu: 500m
              memory: 512Mi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mcp-server
spec:
  selector:
    app: mcp-server
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: ClusterIP
```

### Session Affinity

If your MCP server is stateful (maintains session context), you need sticky sessions:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mcp-server
  annotations:
    # For nginx ingress controller
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity: "cookie"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-name: "mcp-session"
spec:
  sessionAffinity: ClientIP
  sessionAffinityConfig:
    clientIP:
      timeoutSeconds: 3600
```

### Ingress with Streaming Support

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: mcp-server
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: "86400"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-send-timeout: "86400"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-buffering: "off"
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - mcp.example.com
      secretName: mcp-tls
  rules:
    - host: mcp.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: mcp-server
                port:
                  number: 80
```

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: mcp-server
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: mcp-server
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 20
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 70
```

### Microsoft MCP Gateway

For larger Kubernetes deployments, [Microsoft's MCP Gateway](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp-gateway) provides session-aware routing with consistent hashing, RBAC policies, and StatefulSets for session-pinned servers.

## Authentication for Remote Servers

Any MCP server exposed to the network needs authentication. The options, from simplest to most robust:

### API Key (Simple)

Good for internal tools and small teams:

```python
from starlette.middleware import Middleware
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware
from starlette.responses import JSONResponse

class APIKeyMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(self, request, call_next):
        if request.url.path == "/health":
            return await call_next(request)
        api_key = request.headers.get("Authorization", "").removeprefix("Bearer ")
        if api_key != os.environ["MCP_API_KEY"]:
            return JSONResponse({"error": "unauthorized"}, status_code=401)
        return await call_next(request)
```

### OAuth 2.1 (MCP Standard)

The MCP spec adopted OAuth 2.1 as its standard authorization mechanism. The flow:

1. Client sends request → server returns 401 with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` header
2. Client discovers Protected Resource Metadata (RFC 9728) at `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`
3. Client discovers authorization server metadata
4. Client registers dynamically (RFC 7591) or uses pre-registered credentials
5. Authorization code flow with PKCE
6. Client includes bearer token on subsequent requests

In practice, most MCP servers today use simpler API key auth — only about 8.5% of servers implement OAuth. But for production services with multiple users, OAuth is the right path. Frameworks like MCPEngine provide built-in OIDC support for Google, Auth0, and AWS Cognito.

For a deep dive, see our [MCP Authorization & OAuth guide](/guides/mcp-authorization-oauth/).
