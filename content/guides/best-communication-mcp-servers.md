Communication platforms are where work happens. Slack channels, Teams threads, Discord servers — they hold institutional knowledge, decisions, and context that AI agents need but can't reach without an MCP integration.

The three major platforms have taken dramatically different approaches to MCP. Slack shipped a polished official server. Microsoft followed with an official Teams server but left gaps for community projects to fill. Discord hasn't shipped anything, leaving five community projects to fight it out.

We've reviewed all three: the [Slack MCP server](/reviews/slack-mcp-server/) (4/5), [Microsoft Teams MCP servers](/reviews/teams-mcp-servers/) (3.5/5), and [Discord MCP servers](/reviews/discord-mcp-servers/) (3/5). Here's how they compare, and which one to pick for your setup.

## Three Maturity Levels

### Slack — The Standard (4/5)

Slack's official MCP server is the benchmark for communication platform integration. Hosted at `mcp.slack.com`, it requires zero local setup — no npm install, no Docker, no local process. Your MCP client connects directly to Slack's endpoint.

**What makes it the best:**
- **OAuth with granular scopes.** You choose exactly what the agent can access: public channels, private channels, DMs, group DMs. Each requires separate consent. This is the right security model.
- **Natural language responses.** Search results come back formatted for LLM consumption, not raw API JSON. Less token waste, more usable answers.
- **Search that works.** Searching across an entire workspace — by date, user, content type — is genuinely powerful for knowledge retrieval.
- **Canvas integration.** Create and update Slack canvases programmatically. Export as markdown. Useful for agents that generate reports or documentation.
- **Admin oversight.** Admins see which MCP clients have access, with full audit logging.

**Where it falls short:** No reactions, no scheduled messages, no emoji. Rate limits vary by tool and aren't well-documented. The Marketplace requirement makes custom client development harder. No SSE transport (Streamable HTTP only).

**Bottom line:** If your team uses Slack and your MCP client supports it (Claude, Cursor, Perplexity), install this. It's a few clicks.

### Teams — Getting There (3.5/5)

Microsoft shipped an official server, which puts Teams ahead of Discord. But the server is in preview, lacks search, and only supports plain text messages. The real story is the ecosystem: three servers that together cover what Teams integration needs.

**The official server** (24 tools) gives you full CRUD on chats, channels, teams, and members. Hosted at `agent365.svc.cloud.microsoft` with Entra ID OAuth. Enterprise-grade RBAC. OData query support for server-side filtering. But no search, no files, plain text only, and "Preview" status means Microsoft may change the API.

**floriscornel/teams-mcp** (25 tools) is the community server that fills the gaps. KQL-based message search — the only Teams MCP server with search. File uploads with large file support. Read-only mode via environment variable. LLM-optimized markdown responses. But only 63 stars and some auth reliability issues.

**InditexTech/mcp-teams-server** (5 tools) is the most production-ready: zero open issues, Docker support, versioned releases from a major enterprise (Inditex). Narrowly focused on thread workflows — start threads, reply, read replies.

**Bottom line:** If you need Teams integration today, use the official server for basic chat/channel work, or floriscornel for search and files. When the official server exits preview and adds search, this category will be a 4/5.

### Discord — Waiting for Official (3/5)

Discord has 200+ million monthly active users and is where the developer and AI community lives. And it has no official MCP server. The gap is filled by five community projects, none with more than 206 stars, none with OAuth, none hosted.

**The options:**
- **SaseQ/discord-mcp** (206 stars, Java, 30 tools) — broadest admin coverage: channels, roles, categories, webhooks, DMs. Most contributors (7). But Java means heavyweight deployment.
- **barryyip0625/mcp-discord** (71 stars, TypeScript, 21 tools) — only option with forum support, most active development (103 commits). Both stdio and HTTP transports.
- **hanweg/mcp-discord** (148 stars, Python, 15 tools) — simplest setup, only option with moderation tools. Pairs with `mcp-discord-raw` for raw API access.
- **HardHeadHackerHead/discord-mcp** (10 stars, TypeScript, 134 tools) — covers nearly the entire Discord API but zero community validation.
- **v-3/discordmcp** (186 stars, ~5 tools) — early-mover advantage in stars, but 2 commits and minimal features.

**The fundamental problem:** Bot tokens. Every Discord MCP server uses a single bot token with static permissions. No per-user consent, no granular scopes, no audit trail. If the token leaks, full access to every server the bot is in. Compare this to Slack's OAuth with per-scope consent and admin visibility.

**Bottom line:** Pick based on your specific need — forums (barryyip0625), admin breadth (SaseQ), simplicity (hanweg). But consider waiting for an official server. Given that Slack, GitHub, Stripe, and now Microsoft have all shipped official MCP servers, Discord will likely follow.

## Feature Comparison

### Search

Search is the highest-value communication MCP feature. "Find that conversation about the database migration from last week" — this is what agents are good at.

- **Slack:** Full-text search with date, user, and content type filters. Works across all channels the agent has access to. Built into the official server.
- **Teams:** Not in the official server. floriscornel's community server has KQL-based search — powerful but requires a third-party MCP server.
- **Discord:** No MCP server has search. barryyip0625 has `discord_search_messages` but it's limited compared to platform-level search.

**Winner:** Slack, by a wide margin.

### Security & Auth

- **Slack:** OAuth with per-scope consent. Admin visibility. Audit logging. Marketplace requirement protects workspaces from rogue integrations (annoying for developers, good for security).
- **Teams:** OAuth via Entra ID. Enterprise RBAC enforced server-side. Soft-delete preserves compliance retention. The enterprise security model is strong — arguably stronger than Slack's on paper.
- **Discord:** Bot tokens only. Static permissions. No per-user consent. No admin oversight. If you're in an enterprise environment, this is a non-starter.

**Winner:** Teams for enterprise compliance. Slack for practical security + usability balance.

### Setup Difficulty

- **Slack:** Supported clients (Claude, Cursor, Perplexity) — a few clicks. Custom clients — moderate (Marketplace registration + OAuth).
- **Teams:** All paths require Azure AD / Entra ID configuration. Enterprise familiarity with Microsoft identity helps. Community servers need app registrations.
- **Discord:** Create a bot, get a token, set an environment variable. Technically the simplest, but the lack of OAuth means the security model is weaker.

**Winner:** Slack for supported clients. Discord for raw simplicity (at the cost of security).

### Write Operations

- **Slack:** Send messages to any channel, DM, or group DM. Create and update canvases. No reactions or scheduling.
- **Teams:** Full CRUD on chats, channels, teams, and members (official server). Thread-based posting with @mentions (InditexTech). File uploads (floriscornel). But plain text only — no rich formatting.
- **Discord:** Send messages, manage channels, roles, webhooks, forums (varies by server). No hosted option means running your own write-enabled process.

**Winner:** Teams has the broadest write surface (CRUD on chats, channels, teams, members). Slack has the cleanest write experience.

## Decision Flowchart

**"Which communication MCP server should I use?"**

1. **Does your team use Slack?** → Use [Slack MCP](/reviews/slack-mcp-server/). Done.
2. **Does your org use Microsoft Teams?**
   - Need search or file ops? → Use [floriscornel/teams-mcp](https://github.com/floriscornel/teams-mcp)
   - Need production stability + Docker? → Use [InditexTech/mcp-teams-server](https://github.com/InditexTech/mcp-teams-server)
   - Need full CRUD + enterprise auth? → Use [Microsoft Work IQ Teams](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp)
3. **Does your community use Discord?**
   - Need forum management? → Use [barryyip0625/mcp-discord](https://github.com/barryyip0625/mcp-discord)
   - Need full admin control? → Use [SaseQ/discord-mcp](https://github.com/SaseQ/discord-mcp)
   - Need quick Python setup + moderation? → Use [hanweg/mcp-discord](https://github.com/hanweg/mcp-discord)
4. **Using multiple platforms?** → Start with Slack (most mature), add others as needed.

## Trends to Watch

**Official servers are winning.** Slack's official server (GA, hosted, OAuth) is decisively better than any community alternative. Microsoft's official Teams server, even in preview, provides the hosted architecture and enterprise auth that community servers can't match. When Discord ships an official server, the same will happen there.

**Hosted > self-hosted for communication.** Running a local MCP server for your communication platform adds maintenance burden, security risk (tokens on disk), and deployment complexity. Slack and Microsoft's hosted endpoints eliminate these problems. Community servers that require local processes are inherently at a disadvantage.

**Search is the killer feature.** The ability to search across your organization's communication history from within an AI conversation is more valuable than any specific write operation. Slack has it. Teams has it via a community server. Discord doesn't have it at all. This is the single biggest differentiator.

**Enterprise auth matters more than tool count.** Teams' official server has 24 tools. floriscornel has 25. But the official server's Entra ID OAuth and RBAC enforcement make it the right choice for enterprise use, even with fewer features. Tool count is a vanity metric — auth model is a security fundamental.

## The Bottom Line

The communication MCP landscape has a clear hierarchy: Slack leads, Teams is catching up, Discord is behind.

**Slack (4/5)** got it right. Hosted, OAuth, search, GA, natural language responses. If you use Slack, this is an easy install.

**Teams (3.5/5)** has the right architecture but isn't finished. The official server is in preview, missing search and rich formatting. The community fills the gaps but fragments the experience. When the official server exits preview and adds search, it will match Slack.

**Discord (3/5)** needs an official server. The community options work for specific use cases, but bot-token auth, no search, no hosted option, and five competing projects aren't a sustainable ecosystem. Discord is the most important platform in AI/dev circles — the gap between its importance and its MCP maturity is the widest of any platform we've reviewed.
