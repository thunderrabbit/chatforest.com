Every MCP server developer eventually hits the same wall: a tool call that takes longer than the transport timeout allows.

Maybe it's a multi-step ETL pipeline, a large file conversion, a CI/CD deployment, or a complex database migration. The agent calls the tool, the transport times out, the session breaks, and all context is lost. Before the Tasks primitive, the workaround was ad-hoc — bespoke polling endpoints, webhook callbacks, or forcing users to break long operations into artificially small chunks.

The [2025-11-25 MCP specification revision](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/utilities/tasks) introduced Tasks: an experimental primitive that upgrades MCP from synchronous tool calls to a call-now, fetch-later protocol. This guide covers what Tasks are, how they work, and how to implement them in production. Our analysis draws on the MCP specification, SDK implementations, vendor documentation, and community reports — we research and analyze rather than building these systems ourselves.

## The Timeout Problem

To understand why Tasks matter, consider what happens without them.

Standard MCP tool calls are synchronous: the client sends a request, the server processes it, and the server returns the result — all within a single request-response cycle. If the server takes 30 seconds to process but the transport timeout is 25 seconds, the call fails. The client gets an error, retries (consuming more tokens), and may never get a result.

This is more than an inconvenience. Long operations are common in production:

- **Data processing** — ETL jobs, report generation, large dataset queries (minutes to hours)
- **Infrastructure operations** — deployments, provisioning, migrations (minutes to hours)
- **External API orchestration** — multi-step workflows that call slow third-party services (seconds to minutes)
- **File operations** — large file uploads, format conversions, batch processing (seconds to minutes)
- **AI pipelines** — model training triggers, batch inference, evaluation runs (minutes to hours)

Without a standard async mechanism, each MCP server that handles long operations invents its own solution. Clients can't interoperate. The ecosystem fragments.

## How MCP Tasks Work

Tasks solve this by letting any MCP request return immediately with a durable handle, while the actual work continues in the background. The client can then poll for status, receive progress updates, get results, or cancel the operation — all through standardized protocol methods.

### The Call-Now, Fetch-Later Pattern

The basic flow works like this:

1. **Client sends a request** — a standard `tools/call`, `sampling/createMessage`, or any request that opts into task support. The request includes `_meta.taskId` to signal the client supports async execution.
2. **Server returns a Task** — instead of blocking until completion, the server immediately returns a Task object with a unique `taskId` and `status: "working"`.
3. **Client polls or subscribes** — the client uses `tasks/get` to check status, or receives progress notifications via the existing MCP progress mechanism.
4. **Server completes the task** — when the work finishes, the task transitions to `completed` with the result, or `failed` with error details.
5. **Client retrieves the result** — via `tasks/get` (which includes inline results) or the dedicated `tasks/result` endpoint.

This decouples the operation's lifetime from the transport connection's lifetime. A task that takes 30 minutes works just as well as one that takes 30 milliseconds.

### The Task State Machine

Every task follows a strict state machine with five states:

```
         ┌─────────────┐
         │   working    │ ← initial state
         └──────┬───────┘
                │
        ┌───────┴────────┐
        ▼                ▼
┌───────────────┐  ┌───────────┐
│ input_required│  │ completed │ ← terminal
└───────┬───────┘  └───────────┘
        │
        ▼
┌───────────────┐  ┌───────────┐
│   working     │  │  failed   │ ← terminal
└───────────────┘  └───────────┘

                   ┌───────────┐
                   │ cancelled │ ← terminal
                   └───────────┘
```

Key rules the specification enforces:

- Every task starts in `working`
- Tasks can pause in `input_required` when the server needs more information from the client (works with MCP's [elicitation](/guides/mcp-elicitation-explained/) mechanism)
- Terminal states (`completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`) are permanent — a task **must never** transition out of a terminal state
- The `tasks/cancel` method can move a non-terminal task to `cancelled`, but attempting to cancel a terminal task returns error code -32602

Each task status includes optional `statusMessage` (human-readable description), `createdAt`, and `lastUpdatedAt` timestamps.

### Task Management Methods

The specification defines four standard methods for task lifecycle management:

| Method | Purpose | Returns |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `tasks/get` | Retrieve current task status and inline result if complete | Task object |
| `tasks/result` | Retrieve only the task's result content | Task result |
| `tasks/list` | List all tasks, optionally filtered by status | Array of tasks |
| `tasks/cancel` | Request cancellation of an in-progress task | Task with `cancelled` status |

For `tasks/get`, `tasks/result`, and `tasks/cancel`, the `taskId` parameter is the authoritative identifier — per the spec, receivers must ignore any `_meta` field in these requests.

### Progress Reporting

Tasks don't introduce a separate progress channel. They reuse MCP's existing [progress notification](/guides/mcp-notifications-explained/) mechanism. If the original request included a `progressToken`, that same token remains valid for the entire task lifetime. The server can emit standard progress notifications (percentage, status messages) until the task reaches a terminal state.

This means existing client progress UI — spinners, progress bars, status messages — works with Tasks without modification.

## Implementing Tasks with FastMCP

[FastMCP](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tasks), which powers an estimated 70% of Python MCP servers, already supports the Tasks primitive with a straightforward decorator-based API.

### Basic Implementation

The simplest approach adds `task=True` to a tool decorator:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("DataProcessor")

@mcp.tool(task=True)
async def process_dataset(dataset_url: str, output_format: str) -> str:
    """Process a large dataset and return results."""
    # This runs in the background — the client gets a task ID immediately
    data = await download_dataset(dataset_url)
    transformed = await transform_data(data, output_format)
    return f"Processed {len(data)} records into {output_format}"
```

When a client calls this tool, FastMCP automatically returns a Task object with `status: "working"` instead of blocking. The client polls via `tasks/get` until the result is ready.

### Progress Reporting

For long operations, reporting progress keeps the client informed:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Context

mcp = FastMCP("ReportGenerator")

@mcp.tool(task=True)
async def generate_report(query: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    """Generate a comprehensive analytics report."""
    await ctx.report_progress(0, 100, "Fetching data...")
    data = await fetch_analytics_data(query)

    await ctx.report_progress(30, 100, "Analyzing trends...")
    analysis = await analyze_trends(data)

    await ctx.report_progress(70, 100, "Generating visualizations...")
    charts = await create_charts(analysis)

    await ctx.report_progress(95, 100, "Compiling report...")
    report = compile_report(analysis, charts)

    return report
```

### TaskConfig for Fine-Grained Control

For more control over task behavior, FastMCP provides `TaskConfig`:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.tasks import TaskConfig

mcp = FastMCP("InfraManager")

@mcp.tool(task=TaskConfig(
    mode="required",       # Always run as task (vs. "optional" or "forbidden")
    poll_interval_sec=10,  # Suggest 10-second polling interval
))
async def deploy_service(service_name: str, environment: str) -> str:
    """Deploy a service to the specified environment."""
    await run_deployment_pipeline(service_name, environment)
    return f"Deployed {service_name} to {environment}"
```

The three modes control behavior:
- **`optional`** (default) — runs as a task if the client supports it, synchronously otherwise
- **`required`** — always returns a task; clients that don't support tasks get an error
- **`forbidden`** — never runs as a task, even if the client requests it

## Durable Execution with Temporal

For operations that must survive process restarts, network failures, and infrastructure outages, [Temporal](https://temporal.io/blog/building-long-running-interactive-mcp-tools-temporal) provides a durable execution engine that pairs well with MCP Tasks.

### Why Durability Matters

Consider a deployment pipeline that runs for 20 minutes across five stages. If the MCP server process crashes at minute 15, an in-memory task loses all state. The client polls `tasks/get` and gets a connection error. The deployment may be half-finished with no way to resume or roll back.

Temporal solves this by persisting every step of the workflow. If a process crashes, Temporal picks up exactly where it left off — no lost state, no duplicate side effects.

### Architecture Pattern

The recommended pattern separates MCP tools from business logic:

1. **MCP tool** — thin wrapper that starts a Temporal Workflow and returns the workflow ID as the task ID
2. **Temporal Workflow** — orchestrates the multi-step operation with automatic retry, timeout handling, and state persistence
3. **Temporal Activities** — individual steps (API calls, database operations, file processing) that Temporal executes with configurable retry policies

This means MCP tools can run for unlimited time. The [Temporal MCP cookbook](https://docs.temporal.io/ai-cookbook/hello-world-durable-mcp-server) provides reference implementations showing weather data collection, multi-step provisioning, and interactive approval workflows.

### Interactive Long-Running Tasks

A powerful pattern combines Temporal's durability with MCP's `input_required` task state. A workflow can pause mid-execution, signal the MCP server to transition the task to `input_required`, wait for the user to provide information via elicitation, then resume with the new input.

This enables multi-stage approval workflows, interactive data processing pipelines, and human-in-the-loop operations that span hours or days — all through standard MCP protocol methods.

## Hosting Long-Running MCP Servers on AWS

[Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2026/03/amazon-bedrock-agentcore-runtime-stateful-mcp/) announced stateful MCP server support in March 2026, providing managed infrastructure for long-running operations.

### What AgentCore Provides

AgentCore Runtime runs each user session in a dedicated microVM with isolated resources, maintaining session context across multiple interactions using the `Mcp-Session-Id` header. Key capabilities include:

- **Long-running workloads up to 8 hours** — complex agent reasoning, multi-agent collaboration, and extended problem-solving sessions
- **Stateful sessions** — server maintains context across interactions without external state management
- **Elicitation, sampling, and progress notifications** — full support for interactive MCP features
- **Framework compatibility** — works with Strands Agents, LangGraph, and CrewAI

### Cross-Session Task Persistence

By combining AgentCore with [Strands Agents](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-long-running-mcp-servers-on-amazon-bedrock-agentcore-with-strands-agents-integration/), you can implement cross-session task persistence — a user initiates a multi-hour job, closes their browser, and retrieves completed results in a new session days later. The pattern uses AgentCore for compute isolation and an external store (DynamoDB, S3) for task state that outlives individual sessions.

## Production Patterns and Considerations

### Choosing Your Persistence Layer

Task state must outlive individual connections. The options, roughly ordered by complexity:

| Approach | Best For | Limitations |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| In-memory (dict/map) | Development and testing | Lost on restart; no horizontal scaling |
| File-based (JSON/SQLite) | Single-server deployments | No concurrent access; manual cleanup |
| Redis | Low-latency polling; ephemeral results | Data can be lost without persistence config |
| PostgreSQL/MySQL | Production workloads; audit requirements | More operational overhead |
| Temporal/Step Functions | Multi-step durable workflows | Significant infrastructure investment |
| AWS AgentCore | Managed hosting with session isolation | Vendor lock-in; AWS-only |

### Task Expiry and Cleanup

The specification doesn't prescribe how long completed task results must be retained. In practice, you need an expiry policy:

- **Short-lived tasks** (API calls, queries) — retain results for 5-15 minutes
- **Medium tasks** (reports, processing) — retain for 1-24 hours
- **Long-lived tasks** (deployments, migrations) — retain for days or until explicitly deleted

Whatever your policy, communicate it. Include estimated retention time in the task's `statusMessage` so clients know how long they have to fetch results.

### Cancellation Best Practices

Implementing `tasks/cancel` correctly requires care:

1. **Check cooperative cancellation** — your async runtime's cancellation mechanism (e.g., Python's `asyncio.CancelledError`) should propagate cleanly through your task logic
2. **Clean up side effects** — if a task provisioned resources, cancellation should roll back or flag those resources
3. **Reject terminal cancellation** — per the spec, return error -32602 if a client tries to cancel a completed, failed, or already-cancelled task
4. **Don't block on cancellation** — transition to `cancelled` quickly, even if cleanup continues in the background

### Idempotency and Retries

Network issues mean clients may send duplicate requests. Design for idempotency:

- Use deterministic task IDs derived from request parameters when possible
- If a client sends the same request twice, return the existing task rather than creating a duplicate
- For `tasks/cancel`, cancelling an already-cancelled task should succeed silently (or return the existing cancelled task), not error

### Monitoring and Observability

Long-running tasks need monitoring that short synchronous calls don't:

- **Task duration histograms** — detect operations that are taking longer than expected
- **Status transition tracking** — alert on tasks stuck in `working` beyond expected completion time
- **Failure rate by task type** — identify flaky operations before they cascade
- **Cancellation frequency** — high cancellation rates may indicate UX issues or overly slow operations

The MCP community has proposed [OpenTelemetry semantic conventions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/discussions) for task instrumentation, building on the conventions already defined for standard MCP operations.

## Current Status and What's Coming

Tasks shipped as an experimental feature in the 2025-11-25 specification. Implementation status across the ecosystem as of March 2026:

- **FastMCP** — full support with `task=True` decorator and `TaskConfig`
- **Python SDK** — implementation tracked in [Issue #1546](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/issues/1546)
- **TypeScript SDK** — implementation tracked in [Issue #1060](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/issues/1060)
- **AWS AgentCore** — managed hosting with stateful session and long-running task support
- **Temporal** — reference implementations and cookbook available

The [2026 MCP roadmap](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-mcp-roadmap/) identifies several areas for improvement based on early production feedback:

- **Retry semantics** — standardizing what happens when a task fails transiently and who decides whether to retry
- **Expiry policies** — formal mechanisms for how long task results are retained after completion
- **Horizontal scaling** — evolving the transport and session model so stateful task servers can scale without sticky sessions

## When to Use Tasks (and When Not To)

**Use Tasks when:**
- Operations routinely exceed 10-15 seconds
- Operations involve external systems with unpredictable latency
- Users need progress visibility during long operations
- Operations should survive connection drops or client disconnects
- Multiple clients need to check on the same operation

**Don't use Tasks when:**
- Operations consistently complete in under a few seconds — the polling overhead isn't worth it
- You need real-time streaming output (use MCP's streaming responses instead)
- The operation has no meaningful intermediate state to report

The Tasks primitive moves MCP from a synchronous RPC protocol to something that can handle real-world operational complexity. For teams building production MCP servers that do more than instant lookups, it's worth adopting now — even in its experimental state — because the call-now, fetch-later pattern solves problems that no amount of timeout tuning can fix.
