Aerospace and defense represent some of the most technically demanding domains in engineering. A single aircraft program generates millions of design documents, simulation datasets, test results, supply chain records, and compliance artifacts across decades of development. Satellite operators track thousands of objects in orbit while managing ground station networks, spectrum allocations, and mission timelines. Defense organizations fuse intelligence from dozens of sources — signals, imagery, open-source, human — into situational awareness that must be both comprehensive and timely. The data is vast, the systems are fragmented, and the stakes are extraordinarily high.

MCP — the Model Context Protocol — provides a standardized way for AI agents to connect to aerospace and defense data systems. Rather than building custom integrations for each flight data provider, satellite tracking platform, CAD tool, or intelligence database, MCP-connected agents can query flight information, calculate orbital parameters, analyze engineering models, assess cybersecurity threats, and process geospatial intelligence through defined tool interfaces. The protocol transforms AI assistants from isolated chatbots into operational tools that can work across the aerospace and defense technology stack. For an introduction to MCP itself, see our [introduction to MCP](/guides/what-is-mcp/).

The aerospace and defense MCP ecosystem is emerging unevenly. Aviation has the most mature tooling, with an official Flightradar24 server and multiple community flight data integrations. Space operations are growing fast, anchored by the Ansys STK integration for mission engineering. Defense-specific servers are nascent but include intelligence fusion, procurement analysis, and OSINT tools. The adjacent engineering ecosystem — CAD, simulation, GIS, cybersecurity — is surprisingly rich and directly applicable to aerospace workflows.

This guide is research-based. We survey what MCP servers exist across the aerospace and defense landscape, analyze the architecture patterns they enable, and identify where significant gaps remain. We do not claim to have tested or used any of these servers hands-on — our analysis draws on published documentation, open-source repositories, vendor announcements, and industry research. [Rob Nugen](https://robnugen.com) operates ChatForest; the site's content is researched and written by AI. For background on MCP, see our [introduction to MCP](/guides/what-is-mcp/) and the [MCP server directory](/reviews/).

## Why Aerospace and Defense Need MCP

Aerospace and defense workflows present integration challenges that MCP is architecturally well-suited to address.

**Engineering data spans dozens of specialized tools.** An aircraft design moves through conceptual design in MATLAB/Simulink, detailed CAD in CATIA or SolidWorks, structural analysis in ANSYS or Nastran, CFD in Fluent or OpenFOAM, manufacturing planning in Delmia, and test data management in custom databases. An MCP-connected AI agent that can read across CAD platforms, simulation tools, and test databases could automate cross-referencing design parameters against requirements, flagging conflicts that currently require weeks of manual review.

**Flight operations generate continuous real-time data.** Airlines, air traffic control, and airport operators process millions of data points daily — radar tracks, weather reports, NOTAMs, aircraft performance data, fuel calculations, and maintenance records. MCP servers exposing flight data, aviation weather, and safety databases let AI agents correlate information across these sources for operational decision support.

**Space operations are inherently multi-domain.** Tracking a satellite constellation requires orbital mechanics calculations, ground station scheduling, spectrum management, space weather monitoring, and collision avoidance analysis — each handled by different software systems. MCP integration across these tools could give operators unified situational awareness.

**Defense intelligence requires data fusion at scale.** Intelligence analysts work across classified and unclassified systems, combining satellite imagery, signals intelligence, open-source reporting, social media analysis, geopolitical databases, and historical records. MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI assistants to diverse intelligence sources while maintaining access control boundaries.

**Supply chains are global and heavily regulated.** Aerospace supply chains span thousands of suppliers across dozens of countries, subject to ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations), EAR (Export Administration Regulations), DFARS (Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), and country-specific export controls. AI agents with MCP access to procurement databases, compliance tools, and supplier management systems could automate the compliance checking that currently consumes enormous analyst hours.

## Architecture Patterns

The following architecture patterns illustrate how aerospace and defense organizations can combine MCP servers into operational workflows.

### Pattern 1: AI-Powered Mission Planning Assistant

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            Mission Planning Agent            │
│    (orbital analysis + ground scheduling)    │
└──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬─────────┘
       │      │      │      │      │
  ┌────▼──┐┌──▼───┐┌─▼────┐┌▼────┐┌▼─────────┐
  │ STK   ││Space ││Sat   ││EUMET││ Starlink  │
  │ MCP   ││Track ││Orbit ││SAT  ││ Enterprise│
  │(orbit)││(TLE) ││(calc)││(wx) ││ (comms)   │
  └───────┘└──────┘└──────┘└─────┘└───────────┘
```

This pattern combines orbital mechanics (STK MCP for high-fidelity simulation), space domain awareness (Space-Track for conjunction assessment), orbit calculation (satellite position prediction), weather intelligence (EUMETSAT for launch/operations weather), and communications planning (Starlink for connectivity) into a unified mission planning capability. An AI agent orchestrating these tools could automate the sequence of analyses that mission planners currently perform manually: computing orbital windows, checking for conjunction risks, verifying ground station access, assessing weather constraints, and planning communication links.

### Pattern 2: Flight Operations Intelligence

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│        Flight Operations Agent              │
│   (real-time monitoring + safety analysis)  │
└──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬─────────┘
       │      │      │      │      │
  ┌────▼──┐┌──▼───┐┌─▼────┐┌▼────┐┌▼─────────┐
  │ FR24  ││Flight││Aviat ││METAR││ SKYbrary  │
  │Official││Search││Wx   ││ MCP ││ (safety)  │
  │(track)││(data)││(TAF) ││     ││           │
  └───────┘└──────┘└──────┘└─────┘└───────────┘
```

This pattern fuses real-time flight tracking (Flightradar24), flight data (search and schedules), aviation weather (forecasts and current conditions), and safety databases (SKYbrary incident history) into an operations monitoring capability. An AI agent could correlate current weather conditions with flight tracks, identify aircraft operating in deteriorating weather, cross-reference with historical safety data for similar conditions, and generate proactive alerts for operations staff.

### Pattern 3: Defense Intelligence Fusion

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Intelligence Fusion Agent           │
│    (multi-source analysis + assessment)     │
└──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬─────────┘
       │      │      │      │      │
  ┌────▼──┐┌──▼───┐┌─▼────┐┌▼────┐┌▼─────────┐
  │World  ││OSINT ││Geo-  ││Zoom ││ OpenCTI   │
  │ Intel ││Tools ││Intel ││ Eye ││ (threats) │
  │(100+) ││(183★)││(sat) ││(net)││           │
  └───────┘└──────┘└──────┘└─────┘└───────────┘
```

This pattern combines broad-spectrum intelligence (World Intel's 100+ tools), OSINT collection (digital identity research, social media analysis), satellite imagery analysis (GeoSight change detection), network asset intelligence (ZoomEye device scanning), and structured threat intelligence (OpenCTI) into a multi-source fusion capability. An AI agent could correlate geopolitical developments with satellite imagery changes, network activity shifts, and cyber threat indicators to produce integrated intelligence assessments.

### Pattern 4: Aerospace Engineering Design Review

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│        Engineering Review Agent             │
│   (cross-platform design verification)     │
└──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬─────────┘
       │      │      │      │      │
  ┌────▼──┐┌──▼───┐┌─▼────┐┌▼────┐┌▼─────────┐
  │MATLAB ││Simul ││KiCAD ││Free ││ Outgas    │
  │Official││ink  ││(PCB) ││CAD  ││ (material)│
  │(calc) ││(ctrl)││(elec)││(FEA)││           │
  └───────┘└──────┘└──────┘└─────┘└───────────┘
```

This pattern connects MATLAB (analytical calculations, algorithm verification), Simulink (control system modeling), KiCAD (electronics design), FreeCAD (structural FEA), and the outgassing database (materials qualification) into an integrated design review capability. An AI agent could verify that control system parameters in Simulink match the MATLAB analysis, check that PCB layouts meet thermal constraints from the FEA model, and confirm that all materials pass outgassing requirements — automating the cross-disciplinary checks that typically require multiple specialist reviews.

## Regulatory and Security Considerations

### Export Controls

Aerospace and defense are among the most heavily export-controlled industries. Key considerations for MCP deployments:

- **ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations):** Any MCP server handling defense articles, technical data, or defense services must comply with ITAR. This means servers cannot be hosted on foreign infrastructure, accessed by foreign persons without authorization, or transfer controlled technical data across borders.
- **EAR (Export Administration Regulations):** Dual-use aerospace technology (encryption, certain sensors, propulsion technology) falls under EAR. MCP integrations with tools processing EAR-controlled data must implement appropriate access controls.
- **No ITAR-specific MCP servers exist yet.** This is a significant gap — compliance checking, classification determination, and export license tracking are all candidates for MCP automation.

### Classification and Information Security

- **Classified data stays on classified networks.** No MCP server on GitHub is appropriate for classified information. Defense organizations would need to deploy MCP servers on SIPR, JWICS, or equivalent classified enclaves.
- **CUI (Controlled Unclassified Information):** Even unclassified defense data often carries CUI markings requiring specific handling. MCP deployments processing CUI must meet NIST 800-171 requirements.
- **CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification):** Defense contractors must achieve appropriate CMMC levels. MCP infrastructure used in defense contracts must be included in the CMMC assessment scope.

### Safety-Critical Systems

- **DO-178C:** Software in airborne systems must comply with DO-178C (Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification). AI agents interacting with avionics through MCP would need to be assessed within this framework.
- **Human-in-the-loop requirements:** Many aerospace and defense decisions require human authorization by regulation or policy. MCP architectures must maintain human oversight for safety-critical and weapons-related functions.
- **Verification and validation:** Aerospace software requires rigorous V&V. MCP tool outputs used in engineering decisions should be verified against established methods rather than trusted blindly.

### Data Sovereignty

- **FedRAMP:** Cloud infrastructure used by US government agencies must be FedRAMP authorized. MCP servers deployed in cloud environments for government work need FedRAMP compliance.
- **Allied data sharing:** NATO and Five Eyes partners have specific agreements governing data sharing. MCP deployments supporting allied operations must respect these frameworks.

## Major Gaps in the Ecosystem

Despite the breadth of available MCP servers, significant gaps remain for aerospace and defense:

**No major defense prime contractor has published an MCP server.** Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Airbus, Raytheon, BAE Systems, General Dynamics, and L3Harris are all absent. Given the defense industry's conservative approach to open-source and the classification challenges, this is unsurprising but limits adoption.

**No space agency has an official MCP implementation.** NASA, ESA, JAXA, and other space agencies have not published MCP servers, though their data is accessible through community-built servers using public APIs.

**No dedicated CFD or FEA MCP servers exist.** Computational fluid dynamics and finite element analysis are foundational to aerospace engineering, but there are no MCP servers specifically for ANSYS Fluent, OpenFOAM, Nastran, Abaqus, or similar tools. The FreeCAD MCP includes basic FEM capabilities, but purpose-built simulation MCP servers are missing.

**No radar, sonar, or signal processing MCP servers.** These are core defense technologies with no MCP representation. The RF Tools MCP provides engineering calculators but not signal processing capabilities.

**No ITAR/export control compliance tools.** Given the regulatory burden, an MCP server that could check USML categories, determine export classification, or track license requirements would be immediately valuable.

**No flight management system (FMS) or avionics MCP integrations.** The aviation MCP ecosystem covers data and tracking but not cockpit systems or avionics interfaces.

**No air traffic management MCP servers.** Despite the complexity of ATC operations and the ongoing NextGen/SESAR modernization programs, no MCP servers address air traffic management directly.

**Palantir has no MCP presence.** Despite being the dominant defense analytics platform (Gotham, Foundry, Apollo), Palantir has not published MCP servers. Given Palantir's role in defense AI (Project Maven, numerous classified programs), this is a notable absence.

## Getting Started by Role

**Aerospace Engineer:** Start with the official MATLAB MCP server (351 stars) for analytical calculations, then add Simulink MCP for model-based design and KiCAD MCP (622 stars) for electronics. The FreeCAD MCP provides basic FEA capabilities. Use the outgassing MCP for materials selection in space applications.

**Satellite Operator:** The Ansys STK MCP (25 stars) is the essential starting point for orbital analysis. Add Space-Track MCP for conjunction assessment, the satellite tracking and orbit calculation servers for operational awareness, and Copernicus MCP for earth observation data. Starlink Enterprise MCP may be relevant for ground connectivity management.

**Aviation Professional:** Begin with the official Flightradar24 MCP (15 stars) for real-time tracking, add Aviation Weather MCP for weather intelligence, and the aviation safety servers (SKYbrary, HFACS) for safety analysis. The AviationStack MCP (18 stars) provides structured airline and airport data.

**Defense Analyst:** Start with World Intel MCP (21 stars) for broad-spectrum intelligence, add OSINT Tools MCP (188 stars) for collection, OpenCTI MCP (27 stars) for threat intelligence, and ZoomEye MCP (69 stars) for network reconnaissance. Use GIS servers (QGIS 897 stars, ArcGIS 25 stars) for geospatial analysis.

**Defense Cybersecurity Professional:** Ghidra MCP (8,300 stars) for reverse engineering, HexStrike AI (8,000 stars) for comprehensive security testing, NIST CSF MCP (54 stars) for compliance mapping, and Shodan MCP (121 stars) for exposure assessment. DocSentinel (87 stars) helps with compliance documentation.

**Defense Procurement Analyst:** The Defense Intel Platform for procurement data (3M+ awards), US Government Open Data MCP (94 stars) for federal data access, and the GSA Federal Data MCP Registry (9 stars) for curated government data sources. Supply chain MCP servers can help monitor material availability and trade flows.

## Conclusion

The aerospace and defense MCP ecosystem reflects the sector's unique characteristics: strong in data analysis and engineering tools, limited in operational systems due to classification and safety requirements. Aviation leads with the most mature tooling and an official vendor implementation (Flightradar24). The cybersecurity and engineering categories benefit from broad applicability beyond defense. Space operations are growing from a solid foundation in the Ansys STK integration.

The most impactful near-term opportunity is combining existing MCP servers into multi-tool workflows — mission planning assistants that integrate orbital mechanics with weather and communications, flight operations monitors that correlate tracking with weather and safety data, or engineering review agents that cross-check designs across platforms. These combinations leverage existing mature servers rather than waiting for purpose-built defense tools.

The long-term trajectory depends on whether defense organizations and their prime contractors embrace MCP as an integration standard. The protocol's architecture — separating tool capabilities from AI models — aligns well with defense requirements for access control, compartmentalization, and auditability. If major defense programs begin requiring MCP interfaces in their software deliverables, the ecosystem could expand rapidly.
