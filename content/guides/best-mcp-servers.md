Most "best MCP servers" lists are SEO plays: 10-15 servers, one paragraph each, no testing. They tell you a server exists. They don't tell you if it's good.

We've spent weeks reviewing MCP servers individually — installing them, configuring them, testing their tools, reading their source code, checking their GitHub issues. We've published [20 in-depth reviews](/reviews/) and [10 category comparisons](/guides/) so far. This guide distills all of that into one page.

**What makes this different:** every recommendation here links to a full review or comparison where we show our work. If we say a server has a security vulnerability, we explain exactly what it is. If we say one server is better than another, we tell you why.

## Browser automation

**Winner: [Playwright MCP](/reviews/playwright-mcp-server/) (4.5/5)** — the highest-rated server we've reviewed.

Playwright MCP's killer feature is accessibility tree targeting. Instead of brittle CSS selectors that break when a site redesigns, it identifies elements by their semantic role — "click the Submit button" actually works. Add three browser engines (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit), 25+ tools, code generation, and Microsoft's backing, and it's the clear default.

[Puppeteer MCP](/reviews/puppeteer-mcp-server/) (3.5/5) still works, but it's showing its age. CSS selector brittleness, Chrome-only, no accessibility tree. If you're starting a new project, use Playwright.

For cloud-hosted browser automation (anti-bot detection, CAPTCHA solving), look at Browserbase or Firecrawl.

**Full comparison:** [Best Browser Automation MCP Servers in 2026](/guides/best-browser-mcp-servers/)

---

## Search

Search is the most fundamental agent capability, and there are three paradigms to understand:

**Keyword search** — traditional web search. Best for specific queries ("React useEffect cleanup syntax"), fact-checking, and news.
- **Our pick: [Brave Search](/reviews/brave-search-mcp-server/) (4/5).** Six tools (web, local, image, video, news, summarizer), independent search index, no Google tracking. The default search server for most agents.

**Semantic search** — neural embeddings that understand concepts, not just keywords. Best for research, finding similar content, and exploratory queries.
- **Our pick: [Exa](/reviews/exa-mcp-server/) (4/5).** Outperforms Tavily on benchmarks (81% vs 71% WebWalker) with lower latency. Query-dependent highlights reduce token usage by 50-75%. Nine tools including async deep researcher. 1,000 free requests/month.

**Answer engines** — return synthesized answers with citations, not just links.
- **Worth considering:** Perplexity Sonar. Good for quick factual answers. Not a replacement for search — it's a complement.

**Our recommendation:** use two search servers. Brave for specific lookups, Exa for research. They cover different query types and together cost under $20/month at moderate usage.

**Full comparison:** [Best Search MCP Servers in 2026](/guides/best-search-mcp-servers/)

---

## Web scraping & fetching

If your agent just needs to read a web page, you have options ranging from a single `fetch` tool to full cloud scraping platforms.

**Our pick: zcaceres/fetch-mcp** — the community fork of the official Fetch server. It adds SSRF protection (the official server [will happily fetch your localhost](/reviews/fetch-mcp-server/)), six output formats (markdown, HTML, JSON, plain text, screenshot, PDF), and it's free.

The [official Fetch server](/reviews/fetch-mcp-server/) (3.5/5) works for basic use cases where you control the URLs, but the known SSRF vulnerability means you shouldn't point it at untrusted input.

For JavaScript-rendered pages, use [Playwright MCP](/reviews/playwright-mcp-server/) or fetcher-mcp (Playwright-based fetching without the full browser automation toolkit).

For scale (crawling entire sites, anti-bot, CAPTCHA solving), look at Firecrawl or Crawl4AI.

**Full comparison:** [Best Web Scraping & Fetching MCP Servers in 2026](/guides/best-web-scraping-mcp-servers/)

---

## Databases

The official database MCP servers are both archived — and one of them has a security vulnerability.

The [official PostgreSQL server](/reviews/postgres-mcp-server/) (2.5/5) has a SQL injection vulnerability that bypasses its read-only transaction wrapper. Multi-statement injection (`COMMIT; DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE;`) works because the Node.js postgres client accepts semicolon-delimited statements. **Stop using it.**

The [official SQLite server](/reviews/sqlite-mcp-server/) (3/5) is a good learning tool but runs `DROP TABLE` without asking. No safety guardrails, no parameterized queries. Fine for demos, not for real data.

**For cloud Postgres:** [Neon MCP](/reviews/neon-mcp-server/) (4/5) is the standout for pure database work. 20 tools, OAuth authentication, and a branch-based migration workflow that makes schema changes safe by default. For full backend management, [Supabase MCP](/reviews/supabase-mcp-server/) (4/5) covers database, edge functions, storage, and debugging in one server — broader scope but weaker branching (schema-only, paid plans only).

**For self-hosted PostgreSQL:** Use **Postgres MCP Pro** by crystaldba (2,300+ GitHub stars). It adds query analysis, performance tuning, and actual safety features. Or use **DBHub** by Bytebase for multi-database support (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, and more).

**For SQLite:** Use **jparkerweb/mcp-sqlite**, the actively maintained community alternative with parameterized queries and better safety.

**For analytics:** Consider **MotherDuck DuckDB** — excellent for analytical queries and Parquet/CSV data without a running database.

**Full comparison:** [Best Database MCP Servers in 2026](/guides/best-database-mcp-servers/)

## Memory & knowledge

Agents that forget everything between sessions are expensive autocomplete. But persistent memory is hard to get right.

The [official Memory server](/reviews/memory-mcp-server/) (3.5/5) has the right concept (entity-relation knowledge graph) but real scaling problems. The `read_graph` tool dumps the entire graph into context — 14K+ tokens reported — and there's no memory isolation between projects.

**For enterprise/team use:** **Zep** — temporal knowledge graphs with automatic entity extraction, relationship inference, and time-aware retrieval. The most sophisticated option.

**For semantic retrieval:** **mem0** (MemZero) — automatic embedding-based search, deduplication, and conflict resolution. Good for agents that need to find *relevant* memories, not dump *all* memories.

**For personal/local use:** **Basic Memory** — stores memories as Markdown files you can read and edit. Human-readable storage is underrated.

**For simple use cases:** The official Memory server is fine if your graph stays small (under a few hundred entities) and you only use it for one project.

**Full comparison:** [Best Memory & Knowledge MCP Servers in 2026](/guides/best-memory-mcp-servers/)

---

## Filesystem, version control & communication

These categories each have a clear default choice:

**[Filesystem MCP](/reviews/filesystem-mcp-server/) (4/5)** — Anthropic's reference server. Read, write, search, and manage files within configurable directory boundaries. Does what it says, does it well. The `allowed_directories` config is a simple but effective safety mechanism.

**[GitHub MCP](/reviews/github-mcp-server/) (4/5)** — GitHub's official server. PR workflows, Actions integration, issue management, code search. Setup friction is real (Docker, token scoping), but once configured it's powerful. The remote GHES installation option (`npx -y @anthropic-ai/github-mcp-server@latest`) is the easiest path.

**[Slack MCP](/reviews/slack-mcp-server/) (4/5)** — Slack's official server (launched Feb 2026). Hosted architecture at mcp.slack.com, OAuth scopes, granular privacy controls. The right way to give agents Slack access — no bot tokens on disk, admin oversight built in.

---

## Observability & developer tools

The most "first-party" category in the MCP ecosystem — every major platform has shipped an official MCP server.

**[Sentry MCP](/reviews/sentry-mcp-server/) (4/5)** — the best example of how first-party MCP integration *should* work. OAuth 2.0 auth (no tokens on disk), zero-install remote server at mcp.sentry.dev, Seer AI root cause analysis. Pre-1.0 rough edges (748+ GitHub issues), but the architecture is right. If you use Sentry, install this.

**Datadog MCP** — the broadest toolset (50+ tools across 9 modular toolsets). Covers APM, infrastructure, logs, error tracking, feature flags, LLM observability, and synthetics. GA status. The enterprise choice.

**Grafana MCP** (1,200+ stars) — the only open-source option that works with any backend data source. Best for teams running their own observability stack.

**New Relic MCP** — natural language to NRQL translation (no query language required). 35 tools, generous free tier (100GB/mo). Public Preview.

**Honeycomb MCP** — high-cardinality event analysis with natural language querying and Agent Skills for autonomous investigation. Best for complex distributed debugging.

**PagerDuty MCP** — incident management, not telemetry. Pairs with any debugging server for full incident response automation. OAuth 2.0 + self-hosted options.

**Our recommendation:** Use your existing observability platform's MCP server — these are all tightly coupled to their platforms. Add PagerDuty if you're on-call.

**Full comparison:** [Best Observability MCP Servers in 2026](/guides/best-observability-mcp-servers/)

---

## Image generation

The most fragmented category we've covered. There's no single dominant server.

The [official EverArt server](/reviews/everart-mcp-server/) (2.5/5) is archived and requires a $15/month paid API — the only reference server with a paid requirement. It was a proof of concept that served its purpose.

**Better options:**
- **merlinrabens/image-gen-mcp-server** — multi-provider (OpenAI, Stability AI, Replicate). Pick the best model for each job.
- **FAL.ai MCP servers** — 600+ models, serverless inference. The broadest model selection.
- **spartanz51/imagegen-mcp** — OpenAI-focused with editing capabilities (inpainting, variations), not just generation.

This space is moving fast. A dedicated comparison article is coming.

## Documentation & code context

**Winner: [Context7](/reviews/context7-mcp-server/) (3.5/5)** — the most popular MCP server of 2026 with 48,900 GitHub stars.

Context7 solves a real problem: AI agents hallucinate APIs because their training data is stale. Two tools (`resolve-library-id` and `query-docs`) inject version-specific documentation directly into prompts. 9,000+ libraries, 30+ client integrations, dead-simple setup.

But popularity doesn't mean perfection. A [ContextCrush context poisoning vulnerability](https://noma.security/blog/contextcrush-context7-the-mcp-server-vulnerability/) was patched in February 2026, the free tier was cut 83–92% in January 2026, and community-contributed docs are unverified against official sources.

**Alternatives worth considering:**
- **GitMCP** (7,800 stars) — replace `github.com` with `gitmcp.io` in any URL. Zero setup, free, works with any public repo. Best for libraries Context7 hasn't indexed.
- **Docs MCP Server** (1,100 stars) — fully local, code never leaves your machine. Best for privacy-sensitive work.
- **Ref.Tools** (1,000 stars) — smart chunking extracts exactly the tokens needed. Best for large API docs where context bloat is a problem.
- **Docfork** (433 stars) — "Cabinets" for project-specific context isolation. Best for teams with multiple tech stacks.

For the full breakdown, see our [Best Documentation MCP Servers](/guides/best-documentation-mcp-servers/) comparison.

## Productivity & knowledge management

A growing category as every SaaS vendor adds MCP support. The dominant pattern: first-party hosted servers with OAuth.

**[Notion MCP](/reviews/notion-mcp-server/) (3.5/5)** — 18 tools for pages, databases, search, comments, and workspace info. The Notion-flavored Markdown optimization is genuinely useful for token efficiency. But the v2.0.0 breaking change (databases → data sources) and OAuth tokens that expire 3+ times per week create real friction. Two premium tools are paywalled behind Notion AI.

**Linear MCP** — Linear's official hosted server at `mcp.linear.app`. 15+ tools for issues, projects, initiatives, and milestones. The Feb 2026 update added product management tools, making it viable for PMs alongside engineers. The best issue tracking MCP server for engineering teams.

**Todoist MCP** — Doist's official server with 20+ tools and natural language task creation. Supports MCP Apps (interactive UI widgets in chat) — a genuinely novel feature no other productivity server has adopted. Best for individual task management.

**Asana MCP** — The most tool-rich option (30+ tools) for enterprise project management. Hosted at `mcp.asana.com/v2/mcp` with OAuth.

**Notable gap:** Google has no official MCP server for any product. Community options (nspady/google-calendar-mcp) fill the calendar gap, but Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Gmail are underserved.

**Full comparison:** [Best Productivity & Knowledge Management MCP Servers in 2026](/guides/best-productivity-mcp-servers/)

---

## Deployment

A new category — deployment platform MCP servers are emerging as first-party vendor integrations.

**[Vercel MCP](/reviews/vercel-mcp-server/) (3.5/5)** — Vercel's official hosted server at `mcp.vercel.com`. 13 tools covering projects, deployments, build/runtime logs, domains, and documentation search. The runtime log querying tool is the standout — filtering by log level, status code, time range, and full-text search is genuinely faster through natural language than through the dashboard. OAuth with client allowlisting provides a stronger security model than most MCP servers.

The tool count is thin relative to Vercel's full platform (no environment variables, no edge config, no KV/Blob storage, no analytics). Community alternatives like Quegenx/vercel-mcp-server offer 30+ tools with full admin control, but trade OAuth security for API token auth. The official server is the safer choice; the community servers are more capable.

Pairs well with [GitHub MCP](/reviews/github-mcp-server/) (4/5) — GitHub handles the code side (PRs, issues, CI), Vercel handles the deploy side (builds, logs, domains).

---

## Design-to-code

A category where the community got there first — and arguably got there better.

**[Figma Dev Mode MCP](/reviews/figma-dev-mode-mcp-server/) (3.5/5)** — Figma's official hosted server at `mcp.figma.com/mcp`. 12 tools covering code generation from frames, design token extraction, Code Connect component mappings, screenshots, and a unique code-to-canvas capture feature that converts live web pages into editable Figma designs.

The server's exclusive capabilities are the draw: code-to-canvas (`generate_figma_design`) closes the design-development loop in a way no community server can. Code Connect maps Figma components directly to your codebase components, improving code generation accuracy over time. OAuth authentication, zero-install remote architecture.

The catch: Figma's free tier gives you **6 tool calls per month** — the most aggressive rate limiting we've seen on any MCP server. Real use requires a paid Figma plan (Dev or Full seats). The output format is prescriptive (React + Tailwind by default), and nested components get flattened.

**The community alternative:** [Framelink](https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP) (13,700 GitHub stars vs. 403 for the official guide repo) outputs descriptive JSON instead of prescriptive code, preserves component nesting, produces ~25% smaller payloads, and works with Figma's standard API limits instead of the 6/month cap. If you just need design-to-code translation, Framelink is the better tool. If you need the full design-code-design loop, the official server is the only option.

## DevOps & infrastructure

The fastest-growing MCP server category. Every major DevOps platform now ships an official MCP server, and AWS alone has 60+ specialized servers.

**For cloud infrastructure (Cloudflare):** **[Cloudflare MCP](/reviews/cloudflare-mcp-server/) (4.5/5)** — the most ambitious MCP server ecosystem we've reviewed. The main API server at `mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp` uses Code Mode to collapse 2,500+ API endpoints into just two tools (`search()` and `execute()`), consuming ~1,000 tokens instead of the 1.17 million a traditional approach would require. Plus 16 specialized product servers for Workers, DNS, observability, browser rendering, and more — all remote-first with OAuth. The V8 sandbox execution model is genuinely secure. If you're on Cloudflare, this is the obvious choice.

**For infrastructure as code:** **Terraform MCP** (HashiCorp, beta). Gives agents access to provider documentation, module specifications, and Sentinel policies from the Terraform Registry. Helps agents write correct resource blocks instead of hallucinating arguments. Supports Stacks for complex multi-component deployments. Deliberately doesn't run `terraform apply` — a smart safety choice.

**For containers:** **Docker MCP Toolkit**. More than a server — it's an ecosystem. The MCP Catalog hosts 300+ verified server images, and Dynamic MCP lets agents discover and install tools mid-conversation. Each server runs sandboxed (2GB memory, no host filesystem).

**For Kubernetes:** **Kubernetes MCP** (Red Hat's `containers/kubernetes-mcp-server`). Native Go binary that talks directly to the K8s API, supporting any resource type, multi-cluster operations, and read-only mode. The fragmented ecosystem (6+ implementations) is the main downside — there's no official CNCF server.

**For AWS:** **AWS MCP** suite (awslabs/mcp). 60+ specialized servers covering compute, storage, databases, AI/ML, security, and cost analysis. The Cloud Control API server enables natural language resource management; the Knowledge server indexes AWS documentation. The breadth is unmatched but overwhelming.

**For Azure DevOps:** **Azure DevOps MCP** (Microsoft, GA). Covers work items, PRs, builds, pipelines, tests, and wikis. Now built into Visual Studio 2026. Remote hosted server coming in 2026.

**For CI/CD:** Use [GitHub MCP](/reviews/github-mcp-server/) (4.5/5) — it covers Actions workflows, build logs, and deployment management. It's the strongest CI/CD option in the ecosystem.

**Safety note:** DevOps MCP servers can modify production infrastructure. Use read-only modes, scope credentials tightly, start with non-production environments, and always review before applying changes.

## The pattern: official servers as starting points

After reviewing 19 MCP servers, a clear pattern has emerged:

**Anthropic's reference implementations are starting points, not destinations.** The official Filesystem and GitHub servers are solid (4/5 each). But the official database servers are archived with security issues (2.5-3/5), the official Memory server doesn't scale (3.5/5), the official Fetch server has an SSRF gap (3.5/5), and the official EverArt server is minimal and archived (2.5/5).

**First-party vendor servers are better.** Sentry, Slack, Brave Search, GitHub — when the company that owns the product builds the MCP server, the integration is tighter, the maintenance is reliable, and the security model is sound.

**The community fills the gaps.** Community servers like Postgres MCP Pro, zcaceres/fetch-mcp, and jparkerweb/mcp-sqlite exist because the official implementations fell short. They're often better than what they replace.

Our rating distribution tells the story:

| Rating | Count | Servers |
|--------|-------|---------|
| 4.5/5 | 2 | Playwright, Cloudflare |
| 4.0/5 | 8 | Filesystem, GitHub, Brave Search, Slack, Sentry, Exa, Neon, Supabase |
| 3.5/5 | 7 | Context7, Puppeteer, Memory, Fetch, Notion, Vercel, Figma Dev Mode |
| 3.0/5 | 1 | SQLite |
| 2.5/5 | 2 | PostgreSQL, EverArt |

The actively maintained servers cluster at 4.0. The archived ones cluster at 2.5-3.0. Maintenance matters more than feature count.

## How to choose: the starter stack

If you're setting up an AI agent from scratch and want a solid default configuration:

1. **[Filesystem MCP](/reviews/filesystem-mcp-server/)** — file access (you almost certainly need this)
2. **[Brave Search](/reviews/brave-search-mcp-server/)** — web search (start with keyword, add Exa for research later)
3. **[Playwright MCP](/reviews/playwright-mcp-server/)** — browser automation (if your agent needs to interact with web UIs)
4. **[GitHub MCP](/reviews/github-mcp-server/)** — version control (if you're building coding agents)

That's four servers. Don't install 15 servers on day one — each server adds tools to your agent's context, and too many tools degrade decision-making. Start small, add as needed.

**Need help installing these?** Our **[MCP Server Setup Guide](/guides/mcp-server-setup-guide/)** walks you through configuring servers in Claude Desktop, VS Code, Cursor, and Claude Code — with role-specific starter stacks for web developers, backend engineers, and researchers.

Before you install anything, read our **[MCP Server Security Guide](/guides/mcp-server-security/)** — it covers authentication best practices, real vulnerabilities we found during our reviews, and a checklist for evaluating any server's security posture.
