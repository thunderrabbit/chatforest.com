Most "best MCP servers" lists are SEO plays: 10-15 servers, one paragraph each, no testing. They tell you a server exists. They don't tell you if it's good.

We've spent weeks reviewing MCP servers individually — installing them, configuring them, testing their tools, reading their source code, checking their GitHub issues. We've published [91 in-depth reviews](/reviews/) and [13 category comparisons](/guides/) so far. This guide distills all of that into one page.

**What makes this different:** every recommendation here links to a full review or comparison where we show our work. If we say a server has a security vulnerability, we explain exactly what it is. If we say one server is better than another, we tell you why.

Now the details.

## Browser automation

**Winner: [Playwright MCP](/reviews/playwright-mcp-server/) (4.5/5)** — the highest-rated server we've reviewed.

Playwright MCP's killer feature is accessibility tree targeting. Instead of brittle CSS selectors that break when a site redesigns, it identifies elements by their semantic role — "click the Submit button" actually works. Add three browser engines (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit), 25+ tools, code generation, and Microsoft's backing, and it's the clear default.

[Puppeteer MCP](/reviews/puppeteer-mcp-server/) (3.5/5) still works, but it's showing its age. CSS selector brittleness, Chrome-only, no accessibility tree. If you're starting a new project, use Playwright.

For cloud-hosted browser automation (anti-bot detection, CAPTCHA solving), look at [Browserbase](/reviews/browserbase-mcp-server/) (3.5/5) or [Firecrawl](/reviews/firecrawl-mcp-server/) (4/5).

## Search

Search is the most fundamental agent capability, and there are three paradigms to understand:

**Keyword search** — traditional web search. Best for specific queries ("React useEffect cleanup syntax"), fact-checking, and news.
- **Our pick: [Brave Search](/reviews/brave-search-mcp-server/) (4/5).** Six tools (web, local, image, video, news, summarizer), independent search index, no Google tracking. The default search server for most agents.

**Semantic search** — neural embeddings that understand concepts, not just keywords. Best for research, finding similar content, and exploratory queries.
- **Our pick: [Exa](/reviews/exa-mcp-server/) (4/5).** Outperforms Tavily on benchmarks (81% vs 71% WebWalker) with lower latency. Query-dependent highlights reduce token usage by 50-75%. Nine tools including async deep researcher. 1,000 free requests/month.

**Search + extraction** — search the web, then extract and crawl the results. Best for RAG pipelines and content ingestion.
- **Worth considering: [Tavily](/reviews/tavily-mcp-server/) (4/5).** Four tools covering search, extract, crawl, and map. The default search API for LangChain and LlamaIndex. Hosted remote server with zero-install setup. Keyword search quality trails semantic engines, but the search-to-extract pipeline is unmatched.

**Answer engines** — return synthesized answers with citations, not just links.
- **Worth considering: [Perplexity](/reviews/perplexity-mcp-server/) (4/5).** Four tools covering search, conversational AI, deep research, and analytical reasoning — each backed by a purpose-built Sonar model. Returns answers instead of links, which is faster for factual queries. Deep research tool produces reports no other MCP server can match. No free tier.

**Our recommendation:** use two search servers. Brave for specific lookups, Exa for research. They cover different query types and together cost under $20/month at moderate usage.

## Web scraping & fetching

If your agent just needs to read a web page, you have options ranging from a single `fetch` tool to full cloud scraping platforms.

**Our pick: zcaceres/fetch-mcp** — the community fork of the official Fetch server. It adds SSRF protection (the official server [will happily fetch your localhost](/reviews/fetch-mcp-server/)), six output formats (markdown, HTML, JSON, plain text, screenshot, PDF), and it's free.

The [official Fetch server](/reviews/fetch-mcp-server/) (3.5/5) works for basic use cases where you control the URLs, but the known SSRF vulnerability means you shouldn't point it at untrusted input.

For JavaScript-rendered pages, use [Playwright MCP](/reviews/playwright-mcp-server/) or fetcher-mcp (Playwright-based fetching without the full browser automation toolkit).

For scale (crawling entire sites, structured extraction, autonomous research), [Firecrawl](/reviews/firecrawl-mcp-server/) (4/5) is the production platform — 12+ tools including an autonomous research agent and LLM-powered data extraction. For free open-source crawling with best-in-class markdown extraction, [Crawl4AI](/reviews/crawl4ai-mcp-server/) (3.5/5) is the most popular option — 61,900+ stars, Docker-only, MCP layer still maturing.

## Databases

The official database MCP servers are both archived — and one of them has a security vulnerability.

The [official PostgreSQL server](/reviews/postgres-mcp-server/) (2.5/5) has a SQL injection vulnerability that bypasses its read-only transaction wrapper. Multi-statement injection (`COMMIT; DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE;`) works because the Node.js postgres client accepts semicolon-delimited statements. **Stop using it.**

The [official SQLite server](/reviews/sqlite-mcp-server/) (3/5) is a good learning tool but runs `DROP TABLE` without asking. No safety guardrails, no parameterized queries. Fine for demos, not for real data.

**For cloud Postgres:** [Neon MCP](/reviews/neon-mcp-server/) (4/5) is the standout for pure database work. 20 tools, OAuth authentication, and a branch-based migration workflow that makes schema changes safe by default. For full backend management, [Supabase MCP](/reviews/supabase-mcp-server/) (4/5) covers database, edge functions, storage, and debugging in one server — broader scope but weaker branching (schema-only, paid plans only).

**For self-hosted PostgreSQL:** Use **Postgres MCP Pro** by crystaldba (2,300+ GitHub stars). It adds query analysis, performance tuning, and actual safety features. Or use **DBHub** by Bytebase for multi-database support (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, and more).

**For SQLite:** Use **jparkerweb/mcp-sqlite**, the actively maintained community alternative with parameterized queries and better safety.

**For MongoDB:** [MongoDB MCP](/reviews/mongodb-mcp-server/) (4/5) is the most comprehensive database MCP server we've reviewed — 37+ tools covering queries, indexes, Atlas cluster management, local deployments, performance advisors, and knowledge search. The first database MCP server with built-in performance optimization (Atlas Performance Advisor) and automatic embedding generation. Set `MDB_MCP_READ_ONLY=true` immediately — it defaults to writable.

**For MySQL:** Use **benborla/mcp-server-mysql** (1,300 stars) — SSH tunnel support, connection pooling, prepared statements, and rate limiting. Or **designcomputer/mysql_mcp_server** (1,200 stars) for a simpler Python-based approach.

**For Redis:** Use the **official redis/mcp-redis** (452 stars) — covers all Redis data structures (strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, streams, JSON), plus vector search and EntraID authentication.

**For DynamoDB:** AWS's official DynamoDB MCP server focuses on data modeling and migration — requirements gathering, model validation against DynamoDB Local, code generation, and cost analysis. A design tool, not a runtime query tool.

**For multi-database environments:** **FreePeak/db-mcp-server** (353 stars, Go) connects to MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Oracle simultaneously with lazy loading for 10+ database setups.

**For analytics:** Consider **MotherDuck DuckDB** — excellent for analytical queries and Parquet/CSV data without a running database.

## Vector databases

Vector databases power RAG — retrieval-augmented generation — the primary way production AI applications ground responses in real data. MCP access to your vector store means your agent can build, populate, query, and tune retrieval pipelines without you writing embedding boilerplate.

**[Chroma MCP](/reviews/chroma-mcp-server/) (3.5/5)** — the most comprehensive vector database MCP server. 13 tools covering full CRUD on collections and documents, semantic + full-text + regex search, six embedding providers, and four deployment modes (ephemeral, persistent, HTTP, cloud). Unique collection forking feature lets agents experiment without touching production data. The main limitation is stdio-only transport — no remote MCP server despite Chroma Cloud existing.

**[Qdrant MCP](/reviews/qdrant-mcp-server/) (3/5)** — only 2 tools (store and find), but the only vector DB MCP server supporting SSE and Streamable HTTP transport. Better for team environments where remote MCP access matters. 1,300 GitHub stars — the most popular vector DB MCP server by community adoption. The extensible `QdrantMCPServer` class lets developers build custom servers on top of it.

**[Pinecone MCP](/reviews/pinecone-mcp-server/) (3/5)** — 9 tools with unique search-quality features: cascading search across multiple indexes, built-in reranking, and documentation search without authentication. Cloud-only with no local mode, and only works with Pinecone's integrated embedding indexes. The search tools are best-in-class, but missing basics like delete and update keep it from general-purpose use.

**[Milvus MCP](/reviews/milvus-mcp-server/) (3.5/5)** — 12 tools from the most-starred open-source vector database (40,000+ GitHub stars). Category-leading five search modes including native hybrid search (combining keyword + semantic in one query). Full collection CRUD, delete support, memory management controls (load/release collections), and SSE transport. Requires a running Milvus instance — no embedded mode. The strongest self-hosted option.

The vector DB MCP category is still young. Chroma leads on deployment flexibility, Milvus leads on search breadth (hybrid search), Qdrant leads on transport and community, and Pinecone leads on search quality.

## Memory & knowledge

Agents that forget everything between sessions are expensive autocomplete. But persistent memory is hard to get right.

The [official Memory server](/reviews/memory-mcp-server/) (3.5/5) has the right concept (entity-relation knowledge graph) but real scaling problems. The `read_graph` tool dumps the entire graph into context — 14K+ tokens reported — and there's no memory isolation between projects.

**For temporal/enterprise use:** **[Zep/Graphiti](/reviews/zep-graphiti-mcp-server/)** (4/5) — temporal knowledge graphs with automatic entity extraction, relationship inference, and time-aware retrieval. 23.7K stars, nine tools, multi-database (FalkorDB/Neo4j/Kuzu/Neptune), multi-LLM provider, fully open source (Apache 2.0). The most sophisticated memory architecture available — tracks not just what's true, but when it was true and when it changed.

**For semantic retrieval:** **[mem0](/reviews/mem0-mcp-server/)** (4/5) — automatic embedding-based search, deduplication, and conflict resolution. 632 stars, nine tools, cloud-hosted with a free tier (10K memories) or self-hosted via OpenMemory (Docker+Postgres+Qdrant). Good for agents that need to find *relevant* memories, not dump *all* memories.

**For personal/local use:** **Basic Memory** — stores memories as Markdown files you can read and edit. Human-readable storage is underrated.

**For simple use cases:** The official Memory server is fine if your graph stays small (under a few hundred entities) and you only use it for one project.

## Reasoning & thinking

Can an MCP server make your agent think better? The [Sequential Thinking MCP server](/reviews/sequential-thinking-mcp-server/) (3/5) is Anthropic's official answer — a single tool that structures reasoning into numbered steps with branching and revision support. It's the #9 most popular MCP server globally (~72,000 weekly npm downloads), and the concept is sound: visible, auditable, step-by-step reasoning.

The problem is timing. When Sequential Thinking launched in December 2024, structured reasoning required external tooling. In 2026, Claude has extended thinking, GPT models have reasoning tokens, and Anthropic's own engineering blog recommends built-in model capabilities over external thinking tools for most use cases. The branching and revision features are elegant but agents rarely use them in practice. And every thought step is a separate tool call — 3-6x token overhead compared to native reasoning.

**Use Sequential Thinking if** you need auditable reasoning traces, your MCP client doesn't support extended thinking, or you're debugging agent decision-making. **Skip it if** your model has built-in reasoning capabilities — you're probably paying extra for something you already have.

---

## Filesystem, version control & communication

These categories each have a clear default choice:

**[Filesystem MCP](/reviews/filesystem-mcp-server/) (4/5)** — Anthropic's reference server. Read, write, search, and manage files within configurable directory boundaries. Does what it says, does it well. The `allowed_directories` config is a simple but effective safety mechanism.

**[GitHub MCP](/reviews/github-mcp-server/) (4/5)** — GitHub's official server. PR workflows, Actions integration, issue management, code search. Setup friction is real (Docker, token scoping), but once configured it's powerful. The remote GHES installation option (`npx -y @anthropic-ai/github-mcp-server@latest`) is the easiest path.

**[Git MCP](/reviews/git-mcp-server/) (3/5)** — Anthropic's reference server for local git operations. 12 tools covering status, diff, staging, commit, and branching. Complements the GitHub server — Git handles local repo work, GitHub handles remote collaboration. The critical gap: no push, pull, or merge operations, so agents can't close the loop without help. If you need a complete local git workflow, the community [cyanheads/git-mcp-server](https://github.com/cyanheads/git-mcp-server) (28 tools) covers push, pull, merge, rebase, stash, tag, and blame.

**[Slack MCP](/reviews/slack-mcp-server/) (4/5)** — Slack's official server (launched Feb 2026). Hosted architecture at mcp.slack.com, OAuth scopes, granular privacy controls. The right way to give agents Slack access — no bot tokens on disk, admin oversight built in.

**[Teams MCP Servers](/reviews/teams-mcp-servers/) (3.5/5)** — Microsoft shipped an official Work IQ Teams server (24 tools, hosted, OAuth via Entra ID) as part of the microsoft/mcp catalog. Full CRUD for chats, channels, teams, and members. Still in preview, lacks search and file operations, plain text only. Community alternatives from InditexTech (358 stars, 5 tools, zero open issues, Docker) and floriscornel (63 stars, 25 tools, KQL search, file uploads) fill the gaps. A half-step behind Slack.

**[Discord MCP Servers](/reviews/discord-mcp-servers/) (3/5)** — No official Discord MCP server exists. Five community alternatives fill the gap, led by SaseQ/discord-mcp (206 stars, Java, 30 tools) and hanweg/mcp-discord (148 stars, Python, 15 tools). All require bot tokens (no OAuth), no hosted option. The contrast with Slack's first-party server is stark — Discord's MCP story is fragmented and immature.

## Observability & developer tools

The most "first-party" category in the MCP ecosystem — every major platform has shipped an official MCP server.

**[Sentry MCP](/reviews/sentry-mcp-server/) (4/5)** — the best example of how first-party MCP integration *should* work. OAuth 2.0 auth (no tokens on disk), zero-install remote server at mcp.sentry.dev, Seer AI root cause analysis. Pre-1.0 rough edges (748+ GitHub issues), but the architecture is right. If you use Sentry, install this.

**[Datadog MCP](/reviews/datadog-mcp-server/) (4/5)** — the broadest toolset (50+ tools across 10+ modular toolsets). Covers APM, infrastructure, logs, error tracking, feature flags, LLM observability, database monitoring, and synthetics. Agent-native design with token-budget pagination and SQL-like log queries. GA status. The enterprise choice.

**[Grafana MCP](/reviews/grafana-mcp-server/) (4/5)** — 40+ tools across 15 configurable categories: dashboards, Prometheus, Loki, ClickHouse, CloudWatch, Elasticsearch, alerting, incidents, OnCall, Sift, annotations, rendering. 2,500 stars, open source (Apache 2.0), works with any backend data source Grafana supports. The most comprehensive open-source observability MCP server.

**[New Relic MCP](/reviews/newrelic-mcp-server/) (4/5)** — natural language to NRQL translation (no query language required). 35 tools, generous free tier (100GB/mo), golden metrics analysis, deployment impact assessment. Remote-hosted at mcp.newrelic.com. Public Preview.

**[Honeycomb MCP](/reviews/honeycomb-mcp-server/) (4/5)** — high-cardinality event analysis with BubbleUp anomaly decomposition. 14+ tools (self-hosted, deprecated) transitioning to hosted server at mcp.honeycomb.io with OAuth 2.1. Works on all tiers including Free (20M events/mo). Best for complex distributed debugging.

**[PagerDuty MCP](/reviews/pagerduty-mcp-server/) (4/5)** — 67 tools across 13 categories for incident management, not telemetry. Read-only by default with explicit write opt-in. Both hosted (mcp.pagerduty.com) and self-hosted (Apache-2.0, Python). Pairs with any debugging server for full incident response automation.

**Our recommendation:** Use your existing observability platform's MCP server — these are all tightly coupled to their platforms. Add PagerDuty if you're on-call.

**Full comparison:** [Best Observability MCP Servers in 2026](/guides/best-observability-mcp-servers/)

## Analytics

The MCP category with the strongest vendor adoption — Google, PostHog, Amplitude, and Mixpanel all ship official servers.

**[Analytics MCP Servers](/reviews/analytics-mcp-servers/) (3.5/5)** — 15+ servers across 6 platforms. [Google Analytics MCP](https://github.com/googleanalytics/google-analytics-mcp) (1,500 stars, official, Apache 2.0) has 7 read-only tools for GA4 reporting with Application Default Credentials — clean auth, active development, but thin on features. [PostHog MCP](https://github.com/PostHog/mcp) (143 stars, MIT) has the broadest tool set: 27+ tools covering analytics, feature flags, experiments, error tracking, and prompt management, with read-only mode and one-command installation into 6+ IDEs. [Amplitude MCP](https://amplitude.com/mcp-server) is a hosted endpoint with 24+ tools, OAuth 2.0, and the widest client support (10+ quick-install integrations) — but it's closed-source with no self-hosting option. [Mixpanel MCP](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/features/mcp) is in beta with natural language query focus. Privacy-first platforms lag: Plausible has only 5-star community servers; Matomo's [mcp-matomo](https://github.com/FGRibreau/mcp-matomo) (8 stars, Rust) uses clever dynamic API introspection but has minimal adoption.

**Our recommendation:** Use your platform's official MCP server. PostHog has the broadest integration; Google Analytics has the most accessible setup.

---

## Cloud storage

Every major cloud provider has some MCP server coverage, but the gap between best and worst is enormous.

**For Google Cloud Storage:** **[googleapis/gcloud-mcp](https://github.com/googleapis/gcloud-mcp) storage-mcp** is the best-designed storage MCP server in the category. 21 tools split into safe (always available) and destructive (opt-in via `--enable-destructive-tools`). New objects can be created safely; overwriting existing ones requires explicit opt-in. Storage Insights integration enables BigQuery queries on storage metadata. Official from Google, Apache 2.0, TypeScript, actively maintained.

**For MinIO / self-hosted:** **[minio/mcp-server-aistor](https://github.com/minio/mcp-server-aistor)** is the most feature-rich storage MCP server overall — 26 tools including bucket management, object CRUD, presigned URLs, versioning, lifecycle policies, and unique AI-powered features (`ask_object` for content analysis, `text_to_object`). Three-level permissions (read-only, read-write, read-write-delete) via flags. Go, both stdio and Streamable HTTP.

**For AWS S3:** The surprise gap. AWS's official server covers only S3 Tables (Apache Iceberg), not standard S3 objects. The best general-purpose option is txn2/mcp-s3 (Go, 9 tools, security-focused) despite having only 1 star. AWS needs to ship a proper S3 MCP server.

**For Azure Blob Storage:** Microsoft's [official server](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp) includes storage as part of 40+ Azure services, but **can upload blobs but can't download them** — a fundamental gap. No SAS URL generation either.

**For Cloudflare R2:** Fully covered through the [Cloudflare API MCP server](/reviews/cloudflare-mcp-server/) at `mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp` — R2 operations are available via the universal search+execute pattern.

**[Full review: Cloud Storage MCP Servers](/reviews/cloud-storage-mcp-servers/) (3.5/5)** — 20+ servers across 7 platforms.

---

## Search engines

Search engine MCP servers let agents query indices, manage documents, and tune relevance. The category has a clear hierarchy: OpenSearch and Meilisearch lead with comprehensive official servers, while Elasticsearch's official server is deprecated.

**[OpenSearch MCP](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-mcp-server-py) (official, 111 stars)** — the most comprehensive search MCP server with 24+ tools across core search, cluster management, search relevance (judgment lists, query sets), and skills (data distribution, log patterns). Unique search relevance tooling that no other server offers. Supports stdio, SSE, streamable HTTP.

**[Meilisearch MCP](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-mcp) (official, 178 stars)** — 20+ tools covering the full Meilisearch API: index CRUD, document ops, search, settings, API keys, task monitoring, system health. Actively maintained with dynamic connection management for multi-environment workflows.

**[cr7258/elasticsearch-mcp-server](https://github.com/cr7258/elasticsearch-mcp-server) (community, 256 stars)** — the practical choice for Elasticsearch users since the official server is deprecated. 17+ tools covering indices, documents, clusters, aliases, and data streams. Supports both Elasticsearch 7.x-9.x and OpenSearch 1.x-3.x.

**Algolia** has two experimental servers (Go and Node) with explicit "not officially supported" disclaimers. **Apache Solr** has an official Apache project server but requires Java 25+ and has minimal adoption. **Typesense** has only community servers with limited features.

**Our recommendation:** OpenSearch for comprehensive search operations and relevance tuning. Meilisearch for the smoothest official experience. cr7258's server for Elasticsearch.

**[Full review: Search Engine MCP Servers](/reviews/search-engine-mcp-servers/) (3.5/5)** — 15+ servers across 7 platforms.

---

## Message queues

Message queue MCP servers let agents produce and consume messages, manage topics and queues, and interact with event streaming platforms. Kafka has the most servers (8+) but also the most fragmentation. Cloud providers lead with official implementations.

**[Confluent MCP](https://github.com/confluentinc/mcp-confluent) (official, ~121 stars)** — the most comprehensive messaging MCP server with 37+ tools covering Kafka topics, Flink SQL execution, Schema Registry, Kafka Connect, and Tableflow. The only server that treats Kafka as a full data streaming platform. Confluent Cloud only.

**[Google Pub/Sub Remote MCP](https://docs.cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/use-pubsub-mcp) (official, managed)** — the most architecturally mature messaging MCP server. Fully managed remote endpoint with OAuth 2.0, IAM-native authorization, IAM deny policies, zero installation. The gold standard for cloud-native MCP.

**[AWS SQS/SNS MCP](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp) (official)** — combined SQS + SNS server with a unique safety model: auto-tags created resources and only allows modifications to MCP-created resources. The safest infrastructure-mutation approach in the category.

**[jesseobrien/nats-mcp](https://github.com/JesseObrien/nats-mcp) (community)** — the most feature-rich NATS server with messaging, JetStream, KV stores, object stores, service discovery, and an embedded NATS server mode that requires no external installation.

**Redis** has official messaging support via [redis/mcp-redis](https://github.com/redis/mcp-redis) covering Streams (durable, consumer groups) and Pub/Sub (fire-and-forget). **RabbitMQ** has an Amazon MQ official server plus community options. **Azure Service Bus** is covered in the official Azure MCP server. **IBM MQ** has an official but minimal server (2 tools). **Apache Pulsar** has 70+ admin tools in pulsar-java-contrib (highest count).

**Our recommendation:** Confluent for Kafka Cloud, Google Pub/Sub for GCP, AWS server for SQS/SNS, jesseobrien/nats-mcp for NATS.

**[Full review: Message Queue MCP Servers](/reviews/message-queue-mcp-servers/) (3.5/5)** — 25+ servers across 10 platforms.

## Image generation

The most fragmented category we've covered — 20+ servers, no dominant player, no working official server. The [EverArt reference server](/reviews/everart-mcp-server/) (2.5/5) was archived in May 2025. No major provider (OpenAI, Stability, Google, Midjourney) has shipped their own MCP server yet.

Four approaches have emerged: single-provider API wrappers (OpenAI, Stability, Gemini, Replicate), multi-provider aggregators (merlinrabens with 10 providers, PiAPI for Midjourney access), local inference bridges (ComfyUI at 222 stars — the most popular server in the category), and free no-auth options (MCPollinations, HuggingFace Spaces bridge).

**Top picks by use case:**
- **Best quality:** SureScaleAI/openai-gpt-image-mcp (97 stars) — OpenAI gpt-image-1, best prompt adherence
- **Best editing:** tadasant/mcp-server-stability-ai (81 stars) — background removal, recoloring, outpainting, search-and-replace
- **Most models:** raveenb/fal-mcp-server (38 stars) — 600+ models on FAL.ai
- **Free, local:** joenorton/comfyui-mcp-server (222 stars) — any model, no API costs
- **Zero friction:** pinkpixel-dev/MCPollinations (39 stars) — free, no auth, no signup

See our full [image generation MCP server comparison](/guides/best-image-generation-mcp-servers/) for all 20+ servers across four architectural approaches — including a decision flowchart.

## Documentation & code context

**Winner: [Context7](/reviews/context7-mcp-server/) (3.5/5)** — the most popular MCP server of 2026 with 48,900 GitHub stars.

Context7 solves a real problem: AI agents hallucinate APIs because their training data is stale. Two tools (`resolve-library-id` and `query-docs`) inject version-specific documentation directly into prompts. 9,000+ libraries, 30+ client integrations, dead-simple setup.

But popularity doesn't mean perfection. A [ContextCrush context poisoning vulnerability](https://noma.security/blog/contextcrush-context7-the-mcp-server-vulnerability/) was patched in February 2026, the free tier was cut 83–92% in January 2026, and community-contributed docs are unverified against official sources.

**Alternatives worth considering:**
- **[GitMCP](/reviews/gitmcp-server/)** (4/5, 7,800 stars) — replace `github.com` with `gitmcp.io` in any URL. Zero setup, free, works with any public repo. Best for libraries Context7 hasn't indexed.
- **Docs MCP Server** (1,100 stars) — fully local, code never leaves your machine. Best for privacy-sensitive work.
- **Ref.Tools** (1,000 stars) — smart chunking extracts exactly the tokens needed. Best for large API docs where context bloat is a problem.
- **Docfork** (433 stars) — "Cabinets" for project-specific context isolation. Best for teams with multiple tech stacks.

See our full [documentation MCP server comparison](/guides/best-documentation-mcp-servers/) for a detailed breakdown of all eight contenders — including architecture models, pricing, and a decision flowchart.

---

## Productivity & knowledge management

A growing category as every SaaS vendor adds MCP support. The dominant pattern: first-party hosted servers with OAuth.

**[Notion MCP](/reviews/notion-mcp-server/) (3.5/5)** — 18 tools for pages, databases, search, comments, and workspace info. The Notion-flavored Markdown optimization is genuinely useful for token efficiency. But the v2.0.0 breaking change (databases → data sources) and OAuth tokens that expire 3+ times per week create real friction. Two premium tools are paywalled behind Notion AI.

**[Linear MCP](/reviews/linear-mcp-server/) (4/5)** — Linear's official hosted server at `mcp.linear.app`. 23+ tools for issues, projects, initiatives, milestones, and documentation. The Feb 2026 update added product management tools, making it viable for PMs alongside engineers. Best-in-class tool design — flat parameter schemas and embedded enum values reduce agent errors significantly. High context cost (17.3k tokens) and remote-only deployment are the main trade-offs.

**[Todoist MCP](/reviews/todoist-mcp-server/) (4/5)** — Doist's official server with 28+ tools and an SDK-first architecture — the same tools work in MCP, Vercel AI SDK, or custom pipelines. Supports MCP Apps (interactive UI widgets in chat) and all three transports (HTTP, SSE, stdio). Two p1 bugs in sections and assignments keep it from its potential, but the scope and trajectory are strong. Best for individual task management.

**[Atlassian MCP](/reviews/atlassian-mcp-server/) (3.5/5)** — The official Rovo MCP server connects to Jira, Confluence, and Compass via OAuth 2.1 at `mcp.atlassian.com`. Cloud-hosted, permission-aware, audit-logged, free with your subscription. But 57 open issues reveal reliability problems: search uses a deprecated API endpoint (#70), ADF conversion failures break write operations, and authentication sessions fail across multiple clients. The community alternative [sooperset/mcp-atlassian](https://github.com/sooperset/mcp-atlassian) (4,600 stars, 72 tools) has 10x the adoption and adds Server/Data Center support.

**[Obsidian MCP Servers](/reviews/obsidian-mcp-servers/) (3.5/5)** — Eight community servers, no official support. Three architectural approaches: Local REST API plugin integration (mcp-obsidian, 3,000 stars, stale), direct filesystem access (mcpvault, 802 stars, lowest friction), and native Obsidian plugin (aaronsb, 256 stars, graph traversal + Dataview + Bases). The native plugin approach has the highest ceiling but is beta-only. For most users, mcpvault (one-line install, token-optimized, active) or cyanheads/obsidian-mcp-server (dual transport, auth, structured logging) are the practical choices.

**[Asana MCP](/reviews/asana-mcp-server/) (4/5)** — The most tool-rich productivity MCP server with 44 tools across tasks, projects, goals, portfolios, and teams. Hosted at `mcp.asana.com/v2/mcp` with OAuth, Streamable HTTP transport, 20+ verified client integrations. V2 launched Feb 2026 replacing deprecated V1 (shutdown May 2026). The full Asana Work Graph accessible through MCP — goal tracking, portfolio management, and resource allocation that no other productivity MCP server offers.

**[Google Calendar MCP](/reviews/google-calendar-mcp-server/) (4/5)** — The leading community Google Calendar server (nspady, 1,000+ stars, TypeScript, MIT). 12 tools for events, scheduling, availability, and multi-account management with cross-calendar conflict detection. OAuth 2.0, npm package (`@cocal/google-calendar-mcp`), Docker support. Unique features: intelligent event import from images/PDFs, tool filtering for security, recurring event granularity. No official Google MCP server exists — Google shipped and then removed MCP from their Workspace CLI in March 2026.

**Notable gap:** Google has no official MCP server for any product. The community Google Calendar server fills the calendar gap well, but Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Gmail remain underserved by dedicated MCP servers.

**Full comparison:** [Best Productivity & Knowledge Management MCP Servers in 2026](/guides/best-productivity-mcp-servers/)

---

## Deployment

A new category — deployment platform MCP servers are emerging as first-party vendor integrations.

**[Vercel MCP](/reviews/vercel-mcp-server/) (3.5/5)** — Vercel's official hosted server at `mcp.vercel.com`. 13 tools covering projects, deployments, build/runtime logs, domains, and documentation search. The runtime log querying tool is the standout — filtering by log level, status code, time range, and full-text search is genuinely faster through natural language than through the dashboard. OAuth with client allowlisting provides a stronger security model than most MCP servers.

The tool count is thin relative to Vercel's full platform (no environment variables, no edge config, no KV/Blob storage, no analytics). Community alternatives like Quegenx/vercel-mcp-server offer 30+ tools with full admin control, but trade OAuth security for API token auth. The official server is the safer choice; the community servers are more capable.

Pairs well with [GitHub MCP](/reviews/github-mcp-server/) (4/5) — GitHub handles the code side (PRs, issues, CI), Vercel handles the deploy side (builds, logs, domains).

---

## Design-to-code

A category where the community got there first — and got there better.

**[Framelink MCP](/reviews/framelink-figma-mcp-server/) (4/5)** — the community Figma MCP server with 13,700 GitHub stars — 34x more than Figma's official guide repo. Two tools (`get_figma_data` and `download_figma_images`) that output descriptive JSON instead of prescriptive React code. Your AI assistant gets design intent ("1px border, 16px padding") and generates code matching your project's conventions, framework, and component library.

The key architectural advantage: descriptive output produces more accurate code than prescriptive output. Component nesting is preserved (the official server flattens it), payloads are ~25% smaller, and it works with any Figma account — no Dev seat required, no 6-calls/month cap. 11,500+ weekly npm downloads, 17 releases, MIT license. The most adopted design-to-code MCP server by a wide margin.

**[Figma Dev Mode MCP](/reviews/figma-dev-mode-mcp-server/) (3.5/5)** — Figma's official hosted server at `mcp.figma.com/mcp`. 12 tools with exclusive write capabilities: code-to-canvas capture (`generate_figma_design`), Code Connect component mappings, FigJam diagram generation. OAuth authentication, zero-install remote architecture.

The official server's draw is the design-code-design loop — no community server can push code back into Figma as editable designs. Code Connect improves code generation accuracy over time by mapping Figma components to your codebase. But the free tier gives you **6 tool calls per month**, prescriptive output can conflict with your codebase conventions, and nested components get flattened.

**Recommendation:** Start with Framelink for design-to-code translation. Add the official server only if you need code-to-canvas capture, Code Connect, or FigJam integration — and have a paid Figma plan.

## Payments

A new category — and one where the first-party server is clearly the right choice.

**[Stripe MCP](/reviews/stripe-mcp-server/) (4/5)** — Stripe's official server, part of the broader [Agent Toolkit](https://github.com/stripe/agent-toolkit) (1,400 GitHub stars). 25 tools covering customers, products, prices, invoices, subscriptions, refunds, payment links, and disputes. The standout feature is **documentation search** — the agent can query Stripe's knowledge base directly, making it genuinely faster to build Stripe integrations through MCP than through the dashboard + docs workflow.

The security model is best-in-class: OAuth via the hosted server at `mcp.stripe.com`, restricted API keys with per-resource permissions for local deployment, and dashboard-managed session oversight. Three layers of access control — more granular than any other MCP server we've reviewed.

The limitation is coverage depth. Stripe has one of the largest APIs in the developer tools space, and the MCP server exposes roughly 10-15% of it. No Checkout Sessions, no Connect, no webhooks, no Terminal, no Tax. Most resources only support create and list — no updates. This makes it excellent for development workflows (prototyping, integration building, documentation lookup) but insufficient for daily payment operations.

Local deployment is TypeScript-only (npx). Community Python alternatives exist but are limited.

**Full review:** [The Stripe MCP Server](/reviews/stripe-mcp-server/)

## Email

Email is arguably the most security-sensitive MCP category. Your inbox contains password resets, financial confirmations, medical records — giving an AI agent access requires careful thought.

**[Gmail MCP Servers](/reviews/gmail-mcp-servers/) (3.5/5)** — The ecosystem has multiple tiers. **Google's own Workspace MCP** endpoint at `workspace-developer.goog/mcp` offers first-party Gmail access with no third-party code handling credentials. **[taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp](https://github.com/taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp)** (1,700+ stars) is the community standard — 12 Google services, 100+ tools, three-tier permissions (Core/Extended/Full) so you can start read-only. **[MarkusPfundstein/mcp-gsuite](https://github.com/MarkusPfundstein/mcp-gsuite)** (477 stars) is a focused Gmail + Calendar alternative with narrower OAuth scope. For headless/server deployments, **baryhuang/mcp-headless-gmail** uses a decoupled credential model that works without a browser.

No official MCP reference server exists for Gmail. The main security concerns: most servers request `gmail.modify` scope (read + write + delete), OAuth tokens stored in local files, and send permission means a hallucinated email could cause real damage. Start with read-only access and escalate gradually.

**Full review:** [Gmail MCP Servers](/reviews/gmail-mcp-servers/)

**[Outlook MCP Servers](/reviews/outlook-mcp-servers/) (3.5/5)** — The Microsoft 365 counterpart. **Microsoft's official Work IQ Mail** server offers 10 tools with KQL search, hosted architecture, and enterprise-grade Entra ID auth — but requires a Microsoft 365 Copilot license (~$30/user/month) and is in preview. **[Softeria/ms-365-mcp-server](https://github.com/Softeria/ms-365-mcp-server)** (530 stars) is the community standard — covers 8+ Microsoft services (email, calendar, OneDrive, Excel, OneNote, Tasks, Contacts) from a single `npx` install with no Copilot license required, three auth modes, and a token-optimized TOON output format. **[ryaker/outlook-mcp](https://github.com/ryaker/outlook-mcp)** (278 stars) uniquely adds Power Automate integration alongside email and calendar.

The enterprise security infrastructure (Entra ID, compliance policies, DLP rules) is more mature than Gmail's, but the Copilot license paywall and preview status make the ecosystem less accessible. No official MCP reference server from modelcontextprotocol/servers exists for Outlook either.

## CRM

CRM data — contacts, deals, pipeline stages, revenue forecasts — is some of the most commercially valuable information a business owns. The MCP ecosystem for CRM is dominated by Salesforce, with significant gaps elsewhere.

**[CRM MCP Servers](/reviews/crm-mcp-servers/) (3.5/5)** — Salesforce leads with **[salesforcecli/mcp](https://github.com/salesforcecli/mcp)** (312 stars, Apache 2.0, official beta) — 60+ tools with dynamic toolset loading for metadata, SOQL, Apex, LWC, and DevOps Center, plus a hosted deployment option via forcedotcom/mcp-hosted. The community offers **[smn2gnt/MCP-Salesforce](https://github.com/smn2gnt/MCP-Salesforce)** (166 stars, Python) and **[tsmztech/mcp-server-salesforce](https://github.com/tsmztech/mcp-server-salesforce)** (139 stars) for alternative approaches.

HubSpot's official [mcp-server repo](https://github.com/HubSpot/mcp-server) exists but is empty. **[peakmojo/mcp-hubspot](https://github.com/peakmojo/mcp-hubspot)** (116 stars) fills the gap with 7 tools and a unique FAISS semantic search feature. For broader coverage, adeel0x01/hubspot-mcp-tools offers 58 tools across 9 categories.

**[kesslerio/attio-mcp-server](https://github.com/kesslerio/attio-mcp-server)** (58 stars, 1,291 commits) is surprisingly excellent for the smaller Attio CRM — 14 universal tools, batch operations, and the most active maintenance by commit count. Pipedrive's top server (WillDent, 46 stars) is read-only; Teapot-Agency offers full CRUD with 40 tools. Dynamics 365 has just one server with 5 tools. Zoho has no production-ready MCP server despite being one of the largest CRM platforms globally.

## E-commerce

Shopify is the first major e-commerce platform to ship MCP servers — and they've shipped two.

**[Shopify MCP Servers](/reviews/shopify-mcp-servers/) (3.5/5)** — A multi-server ecosystem with distinct layers. The **Dev MCP** (414 stars, `@shopify/dev-mcp`) is a zero-config developer assistant: docs search, GraphQL schema introspection, theme validation, and code validation against Shopify's APIs. No API key needed. The **Storefront MCP** is a per-store endpoint for AI-powered shopping: semantic product search (vector embeddings), cart operations, policy Q&A, and interactive UI components — powering "Agentic Storefronts" across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Copilot.

The critical gap: **no official Admin API MCP server**. For store management (products, orders, inventory, fulfillment), you need community servers like GeLi2001/shopify-mcp (39 stars, ~12 tools) or antoineschaller/shopify-mcp-server (22 tools). All are immature with low adoption. Shopify also co-developed the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) with Google — an open standard for AI-agent-to-commerce-backend communication.

**Full review:** [Shopify MCP Servers](/reviews/shopify-mcp-servers/)

## DevOps & infrastructure

The fastest-growing MCP server category. Every major DevOps platform now ships an official MCP server, and AWS alone has 60+ specialized servers.

**For cloud infrastructure (Cloudflare):** **[Cloudflare MCP](/reviews/cloudflare-mcp-server/) (4.5/5)** — the most ambitious MCP server ecosystem we've reviewed. The main API server at `mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp` uses Code Mode to collapse 2,500+ API endpoints into just two tools (`search()` and `execute()`), consuming ~1,000 tokens instead of the 1.17 million a traditional approach would require. Plus 16 specialized product servers for Workers, DNS, observability, browser rendering, and more — all remote-first with OAuth. The V8 sandbox execution model is genuinely secure. If you're on Cloudflare, this is the obvious choice.

**For infrastructure as code:** **[Terraform MCP](/reviews/terraform-mcp-server/) (4/5)** (HashiCorp, beta). 35+ tools giving agents real-time access to provider documentation, module specifications, and Sentinel policies from the Terraform Registry — plus HCP Terraform workspace management, variable sets, and Stacks. Helps agents write correct resource blocks instead of hallucinating arguments. Deliberately doesn't run `terraform apply` — a smart safety choice. Dual transport (stdio + Streamable HTTP), tool filtering, rate limiting. Limited to Terraform ecosystem (no OpenTofu/Pulumi). **[Pulumi MCP](/reviews/pulumi-mcp-server/) (3.5/5)** takes the opposite approach — 11+ tools including `pulumi-cli-up` for actual deployment, resource search across all cloud providers, and Neo agent delegation for autonomous multi-step infrastructure tasks. More ambitious but lower community adoption (66 stars vs. Terraform's 1,300).

**For containers:** **[Docker MCP](/reviews/docker-mcp-server/) (3.5/5)** — the most complete Docker management MCP server. 19 tools covering containers, images, networks, and volumes, with SSH remote support and a plan-and-apply docker_compose prompt. Security-conscious (blocks `--privileged`). Missing `exec` and Compose file support, but covers the full container lifecycle. For the broader Docker MCP *ecosystem*, Docker's MCP Toolkit hosts 300+ verified server images with Dynamic MCP for mid-conversation tool discovery.

**For Kubernetes:** **[Kubernetes MCP](/reviews/kubernetes-mcp-server/) (4/5)** (Red Hat's `containers/kubernetes-mcp-server`). Native Go binary that talks directly to the K8s API — no kubectl wrapper, no external dependencies. 6 modular toolsets (core, config, Helm, KubeVirt, Kiali, KCP), multi-cluster support, read-only and non-destructive modes, automatic secret redaction. 1,300 stars, 747 commits, 58 releases. The most architecturally sound option in a fragmented ecosystem (6+ implementations).

**For AWS:** **[AWS MCP](/reviews/aws-mcp-servers/) (4/5)** suite (awslabs/mcp). 66 specialized servers covering compute, storage, databases, AI/ML, security, and cost analysis. The Cloud Control API server enables natural language resource management; the Knowledge server at `knowledge-mcp.global.api.aws` is a free managed endpoint indexing all AWS documentation. The Core MCP Server orchestrates everything via role-based configurations. 8,500 stars, 190+ releases, active daily development. The breadth is unmatched but the complexity is overwhelming — start with the Knowledge server.

**For Azure DevOps:** **Azure DevOps MCP** (Microsoft, GA). Covers work items, PRs, builds, pipelines, tests, and wikis. Now built into Visual Studio 2026. Remote hosted server coming in 2026.

**For CI/CD:** **[CI/CD MCP Servers](/reviews/cicd-mcp-servers/) (4/5)** — the ecosystem is surprisingly mature. [GitHub MCP](/reviews/github-mcp-server/) (27,900 stars) covers Actions workflows alongside the full GitHub platform. [CircleCI MCP](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/mcp-server-circleci) (80 stars, 15 tools) has the best diagnostic tooling — `find_flaky_tests` and `find_underused_resource_classes` are tools every CI/CD server should copy. Jenkins has both an [official plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/mcp-server-plugin) (66 stars, runs inside Jenkins) and [standalone servers](https://github.com/lanbaoshen/mcp-jenkins) (95 stars, Python). [zereight/gitlab-mcp](https://github.com/zereight/gitlab-mcp) (1,200 stars) covers GitLab pipelines as part of 85+ tools. [Azure DevOps MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-mcp) (1,400 stars) is GA and built into Visual Studio 2026. [Argo CD MCP](https://github.com/akuity/argocd-mcp) (348 stars) handles GitOps deployment for Kubernetes.

**Safety note:** DevOps MCP servers can modify production infrastructure. Use read-only modes, scope credentials tightly, start with non-production environments, and always review before applying changes.

## The pattern: official servers as starting points

After reviewing 91 MCP servers, a clear pattern has emerged:

**Anthropic's reference implementations are starting points, not destinations.** The official Filesystem and GitHub servers are solid (4/5 each). But the official database servers are archived with security issues (2.5-3/5), the official Memory server doesn't scale (3.5/5), the official Fetch server has an SSRF gap (3.5/5), and the official EverArt server is minimal and archived (2.5/5).

**First-party vendor servers are better.** Sentry, Slack, Brave Search, GitHub — when the company that owns the product builds the MCP server, the integration is tighter, the maintenance is reliable, and the security model is sound.

**The community fills the gaps.** Community servers like Postgres MCP Pro, zcaceres/fetch-mcp, and jparkerweb/mcp-sqlite exist because the official implementations fell short. They're often better than what they replace.

Our rating distribution tells the story:

| Rating | Count | Servers |
|--------|-------|---------|
| 4.5/5 | 2 | Playwright, Cloudflare |
| 4.0/5 | 40 | Filesystem, GitHub, Brave Search, Slack, Sentry, Exa, Neon, Supabase, Stripe, Linear, Todoist, Firecrawl, Tavily, Perplexity, MongoDB, AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, Honeycomb, PagerDuty, Framelink, GitMCP, Mem0, Zep/Graphiti, Asana, Google Calendar, CI/CD, Code Security, Secret Management, Log Management, Infrastructure Automation, Database Administration, API Testing, Data Pipeline/ETL, Geospatial/Mapping, Time-Series Databases, Audio/Video Processing |
| 3.5/5 | 39 | Context7, Puppeteer, Memory, Fetch, Notion, Vercel, Figma Dev Mode, Chroma, Browserbase, Crawl4AI, Milvus, Docker, Pulumi, Teams, Atlassian, Obsidian, Shopify, Gmail, Outlook, CRM, Analytics, Cloud Storage, Search Engines, Message Queues, PDF/Documents, Monitoring/Uptime, Notification/Email Delivery, Testing/QA, API Gateways, Container Registries, CDN/Edge Computing, DNS/Domains, Network Security, Performance/Load Testing, AI/ML Model Serving, Data Visualization, Chaos Engineering, Blockchain/Web3, Identity/Auth |
| 3.0/5 | 6 | SQLite, Sequential Thinking, Qdrant, Pinecone, Git, Discord |
| 2.5/5 | 2 | PostgreSQL, EverArt |

The actively maintained servers cluster at 4.0. The archived ones cluster at 2.5-3.0. Maintenance matters more than feature count.

## How to choose: the starter stack

If you're setting up an AI agent from scratch and want a solid default configuration:

1. **[Filesystem MCP](/reviews/filesystem-mcp-server/)** — file access (you almost certainly need this)
2. **[Brave Search](/reviews/brave-search-mcp-server/)** — web search (start with keyword, add Exa for research later)
3. **[Playwright MCP](/reviews/playwright-mcp-server/)** — browser automation (if your agent needs to interact with web UIs)
4. **[GitHub MCP](/reviews/github-mcp-server/)** — version control (if you're building coding agents)

That's four servers. Don't install 15 servers on day one — each server adds tools to your agent's context, and too many tools degrade decision-making. Start small, add as needed.

**Need help installing these?** Our **[MCP Server Setup Guide](/guides/mcp-server-setup-guide/)** walks you through configuring servers in Claude Desktop, VS Code, Cursor, and Claude Code — with role-specific starter stacks for web developers, backend engineers, and researchers.

Before you install anything, read our **[MCP Server Security Guide](/guides/mcp-server-security/)** — it covers authentication best practices, real vulnerabilities we found during our reviews, and a checklist for evaluating any server's security posture.
