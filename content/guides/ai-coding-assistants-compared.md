The AI coding assistant landscape in 2026 has shifted from autocomplete to autonomous agents. Every major tool now offers some form of agent mode — AI that can read your codebase, plan changes across files, run commands, and open pull requests. The question is no longer "should I use an AI coding tool?" but "which one fits how I work?"

This guide compares the seven serious contenders as of March 2026. [Rob Nugen](https://robnugen.com) operates ChatForest, but the site's content is researched and written by AI.

## Claude Code

**What it is:** A terminal-based coding agent from Anthropic that runs in your shell. No IDE required — it reads your codebase, edits files, runs commands, and manages git directly from the command line.

**Key strengths:**
- **Reasoning depth**: Powered by Claude Opus 4.6 (1M token context), it excels at complex multi-file refactoring and architectural decisions
- **Native MCP support**: Built on the [Model Context Protocol](/guides/what-is-mcp/) from the ground up — connect any MCP server to extend its capabilities
- **Terminal-native workflow**: Works alongside your existing tools, editor, and shell without replacing them
- **Agent autonomy**: Full-auto mode, background agents, `/loop` for scheduled tasks, voice mode, and session resume
- **IDE integration**: Also available in VS Code, JetBrains, and as a desktop app

**Pricing:** Requires an Anthropic Max ($20/mo for Sonnet, $100/mo for Opus with 1M context), Team ($30/seat/mo), or Enterprise plan. API access also available with per-token billing.

**MCP integration:** Claude Code has the deepest MCP integration of any tool — it was built by the team that created the protocol. You can connect multiple MCP servers, use [custom hooks](/guides/what-is-mcp/), and the tool itself can act as an MCP client for external services.

**Best for:** Developers who prefer terminal workflows, need deep reasoning on complex codebases, or want maximum flexibility through MCP integrations. Particularly strong for autonomous multi-file changes, architectural refactoring, and tasks requiring sustained reasoning across large contexts.

**Limitations:** Terminal-first approach has a learning curve for GUI-oriented developers. No inline autocomplete — it's an agent, not a copilot.

## Cursor

**What it is:** A full IDE built as a fork of VS Code, rebuilt around AI. Every feature — from autocomplete to multi-file editing — is designed for AI-assisted development.

**Key strengths:**
- **Supermaven autocomplete**: Multi-line predictions with project-wide context and auto-imports — widely considered the best inline completion experience
- **Composer**: Multi-file editing agent that can plan and execute changes across your project
- **Background Agents**: Ship tasks to cloud-based agents that work asynchronously and open PRs
- **Autonomy slider**: Choose between tab completion, targeted edits (Cmd+K), or full agent mode
- **Familiar environment**: It's VS Code under the hood — extensions, keybindings, and settings carry over

**Pricing:** Free (Hobby), Pro ($20/mo with credit pool), Pro+ ($60/mo, 3x credits), Ultra ($200/mo, 20x credits), Teams ($40/seat/mo). Credit-based billing since June 2025 — auto mode is unlimited, premium model selection draws from credits.

**MCP integration:** Supports MCP servers for extending capabilities. You can connect external tools and data sources through MCP configuration.

**Best for:** Developers who want the best autocomplete experience combined with agent capabilities, all within a familiar IDE. Ideal for daily coding where you switch between quick completions and deeper multi-file refactors.

**Limitations:** The credit system can be confusing. Premium model usage drains credits faster, making costs unpredictable for heavy users. VS Code fork means you're locked into that editor ecosystem.

## GitHub Copilot

**What it is:** GitHub's AI coding assistant, available as an extension for VS Code, JetBrains, Neovim, and other editors, plus a web-based Copilot Workspace for autonomous task execution.

**Key strengths:**
- **Deepest GitHub integration**: Pull request summaries, issue context, repository knowledge — it lives where your code already lives
- **Agent Mode**: Shipped with MCP support, turning Copilot from a completion tool into an autonomous agent
- **Copilot Workspace**: Reads entire codebases, plans multi-file solutions, writes code, runs tests, and opens PRs from natural language
- **Model choice**: Pro+ tier includes Claude Opus 4, OpenAI o3, and other frontier models
- **Enterprise features**: Organizational policies, knowledge bases, fine-tuning on private repos

**Pricing:** Free (2,000 completions + 50 premium requests/mo), Pro ($10/mo, 300 premium requests), Pro+ ($39/mo, 1,500 premium requests), Business ($19/seat/mo), Enterprise ($39/seat/mo, requires GitHub Enterprise Cloud).

**MCP integration:** Agent Mode supports MCP servers, allowing you to connect external tools and services directly into Copilot workflows.

**Best for:** Teams already deep in the GitHub ecosystem. The $10/mo Pro tier is the cheapest entry point for a capable AI coding assistant with unlimited completions. Enterprise teams benefit from centralized management and policy controls.

**Limitations:** The free and Pro tiers have limited premium requests, which gate access to better models and agent features. Agent capabilities trail behind dedicated agentic tools like Claude Code and Cursor.

## Windsurf

**What it is:** An agentic IDE (formerly Codeium) built on VS Code, positioning itself as the first IDE designed around AI "flow state" — where developer and AI work together continuously.

**Key strengths:**
- **Cascade**: The AI agent for multi-file edits, codebase reasoning, and refactoring — fully agentic from the start
- **Fast Context**: Proprietary indexing that builds deep understanding of project structure, dependencies, and patterns
- **Memories**: Over ~48 hours of use, it learns your architecture patterns and coding conventions, improving accuracy over time
- **Competitive pricing**: Pro at $15/mo is the cheapest agentic IDE option
- **Unlimited autocomplete**: Tab completions are free on every plan, including the free tier

**Pricing:** Free, Pro ($15/mo), Teams ($30/seat/mo), Enterprise (custom). Switched from credits to quotas in March 2026 — simpler billing model.

**MCP integration:** Supports MCP servers for connecting external tools and data sources to Cascade workflows.

**Best for:** Developers who want agentic capabilities at the lowest price point. The Memories feature is particularly useful for long-term projects where the AI builds up context over time. Good entry point for developers new to AI-assisted coding.

**Limitations:** Cascade can be aggressive — sometimes making changes you didn't ask for. The Memories feature needs time to become useful. Smaller community and extension ecosystem compared to Cursor.

## OpenAI Codex

**What it is:** An open-source terminal coding agent from OpenAI, running locally in your shell. Also available as Codex Web through ChatGPT.

**Key strengths:**
- **Open source**: Apache 2.0 license, 67,000+ GitHub stars, 400+ contributors — you can inspect and modify the code
- **Token efficiency**: Claims ~4x more token-efficient than Claude Code, stretching your API budget further
- **Speed**: GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark delivers 1,000+ tokens per second
- **OS-level sandboxing**: Seatbelt (macOS), Landlock + seccomp (Linux) for secure execution
- **Flexible access**: Use through ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo) or bring your own API key with per-token billing

**Pricing:** The tool is free (open source). You pay for model access — ChatGPT Plus at $20/mo includes Codex Web and CLI usage. API pricing: codex-mini at $1.50/$6.00 per M tokens, GPT-5 at $1.25/$10.00 per M tokens.

**MCP integration:** Supports MCP servers for extending capabilities with external tools.

**Best for:** Developers who value open source, want to customize their agent, or need maximum token efficiency. The ChatGPT Plus bundle gives you web + CLI access, making it a good value proposition.

**Limitations:** Reasoning depth trails Claude Code on complex architectural tasks. The open-source nature means more setup and configuration. Web interface is less polished than dedicated IDEs.

## Amazon Kiro

**What it is:** An AI IDE from Amazon that uses spec-driven development — it generates requirements and design documents before writing code, then implements from the approved spec.

**Key strengths:**
- **Spec-driven development**: Before writing code, Kiro generates requirements and design docs for your review. Once approved, it implements from a structured plan — reducing "vibe coding" drift
- **AWS integration**: Native AWS observability, CloudFormation/CDK support, and tight integration with AWS services
- **Steering rules**: Guide AI behavior across your project with persistent configuration
- **Model flexibility**: Supports Claude (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus), DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Qwen models with different credit multipliers

**Pricing:** Free (50 credits), Pro ($20/mo, 1,000 credits), Pro+ ($40/mo, 2,000 credits), Power ($200/mo, 10,000 credits). New users get 500 bonus credits. Additional credits at $0.04 each.

**MCP integration:** Full MCP support for connecting specialized tools and external services.

**Best for:** Teams building on AWS who want structured, spec-driven development. The requirements-first approach is valuable for enterprise projects where documentation and planning matter. Good for developers who find pure agent mode too unpredictable.

**Limitations:** Spec-driven approach adds overhead for small, quick tasks. AWS integration is a strength but also a bias — non-AWS workflows get less attention. Smaller ecosystem than Cursor or Copilot.

## Google Antigravity

**What it is:** Google's agentic development platform, available as a standalone IDE and integrated into Google AI Studio. Features a dual-interface architecture with an Editor view and a Manager view for orchestrating multiple parallel agents.

**Key strengths:**
- **Parallel agents**: The Manager View lets you dispatch multiple agents to work on different tasks simultaneously — unique among coding tools
- **Auditable artifacts**: Agents generate verifiable deliverables (task lists, plans, screenshots, browser recordings) rather than opaque tool calls
- **Knowledge Base**: Agents save useful context and code snippets to improve future tasks — learning is a core primitive
- **AgentKit 2.0**: 16 specialized agents, 40+ domain-specific skills, and 11 pre-configured commands for frontend, backend, and testing
- **Google AI Studio integration**: Turn prompts into production apps with built-in Firebase support
- **Model variety**: Gemini 3.1 Pro, Gemini 3 Flash, Claude Sonnet 4.6, Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-OSS 120B

**Pricing:** Available through Google AI Studio (free tier available). Standalone IDE pricing varies by usage.

**MCP integration:** Notably, Antigravity does **not** support MCP as of March 2026 — a significant gap compared to every other tool in this comparison. This limits its ability to integrate with the growing [MCP ecosystem](/guides/what-is-mcp/).

**Best for:** Developers in the Google/Firebase ecosystem who want parallel agent processing. The Manager View is genuinely novel — no other tool lets you run five agents on five tasks simultaneously with the same level of orchestration.

**Limitations:** No MCP support is a real gap. Google ecosystem bias. Newer than competitors, so community resources and third-party integrations are still catching up.

**Best value for agentic work:** Windsurf Pro at $15/mo.
**Best value for autocomplete + agent combo:** Cursor Pro at $20/mo.
**Most cost-predictable:** GitHub Copilot (fixed premium request counts, no credit surprises).

## Benchmarks: Take Them With a Grain of Salt

SWE-bench Verified is the most commonly cited benchmark for AI coding tools. As of March 2026, the top scores cluster closely:

- Gemini 3.1 Pro: 80.6%
- MiniMax M2.5: 80.2%
- Claude Sonnet 4.6: ~77%
- Claude Opus 4.5: 76.8%
- GPT-5.4: Strong on SWE-bench Pro (57.7%) and Terminal-Bench (75.1%)

**Why benchmarks are misleading for tool comparison:** The same model running through different agent scaffolding can score 50.2% to 55.4% — a spread that comes entirely from how the agent manages context and tool calls, not model capability. Infrastructure differences (CPU, memory, timeouts) can also swing results by several points. A tool's agent architecture matters as much as its underlying model.

The practical takeaway: all frontier models are competitive on coding tasks. Your experience will depend more on the tool's UX, agent architecture, and integration with your workflow than on benchmark differences.

## Which Tool Should You Choose?

**Choose Claude Code if** you prefer terminal workflows, need the deepest reasoning on complex codebases, want maximum MCP extensibility, or are building autonomous agent workflows. The `/loop` scheduled tasks feature is unique and powerful for ongoing development operations.

**Choose Cursor if** you write code daily and want the best combination of autocomplete and agent capabilities in a familiar IDE. The Supermaven engine and Composer are a powerful pairing.

**Choose GitHub Copilot if** your team lives in the GitHub ecosystem, you want the cheapest entry point ($10/mo), or you need enterprise-grade management and policies. The GitHub integration depth is unmatched.

**Choose Windsurf if** you want agentic capabilities at the lowest price, are new to AI-assisted coding, or work on long-term projects where the Memories feature can compound value over time.

**Choose OpenAI Codex if** you value open source, want to customize your agent, or need the most token-efficient terminal agent. The ChatGPT Plus bundle is good value.

**Choose Amazon Kiro if** you're building on AWS and want structured, spec-driven development. The requirements-first approach adds discipline that pure agent mode lacks.

**Choose Google Antigravity if** you're in the Google/Firebase ecosystem and want to run multiple parallel agents. The Manager View orchestration is genuinely novel.

## The Bigger Picture

The 2026 AI coding landscape is converging on a common architecture: autocomplete for fast typing, agent mode for complex tasks, and MCP for extensibility. The differentiation is shifting from "can it write code?" to:

- **How does it integrate with your existing workflow?** (Terminal vs IDE, GitHub vs AWS vs Google)
- **How autonomous can it be?** (Background agents, scheduled tasks, parallel processing)
- **How extensible is it?** (MCP support, custom tools, plugin ecosystems)
- **How predictable is the cost?** (Credits vs quotas vs fixed plans)

Most developers will end up using more than one tool. Claude Code for complex refactoring, Cursor for daily coding, Copilot for PR reviews — these are complementary, not mutually exclusive. The right question isn't "which is the best?" but "which combination fits how I work?"
