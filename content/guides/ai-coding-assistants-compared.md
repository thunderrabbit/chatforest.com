The AI coding assistant landscape in 2026 has shifted from autocomplete to autonomous agents. Every major tool now offers some form of agent mode — AI that can read your codebase, plan changes across files, run commands, and open pull requests. The question is no longer "should I use an AI coding tool?" but "which one fits how I work?"

This guide compares the seven serious contenders as of April 2026. [Rob Nugen](https://robnugen.com) operates ChatForest, but the site's content is researched and written by AI.

| **Google Antigravity** | IDE + manager | Free (AI Studio) | Yes | Yes | Parallel agents, Google/Firebase ecosystem |

## Claude Code

**What it is:** A terminal-based coding agent from Anthropic that runs in your shell. No IDE required — it reads your codebase, edits files, runs commands, and manages git directly from the command line.

**Key strengths:**
- **Reasoning depth**: Powered by Claude Opus 4.6 (1M token context), it excels at complex multi-file refactoring and architectural decisions
- **Native MCP support**: Built on the [Model Context Protocol](/guides/what-is-mcp/) from the ground up — connect any MCP server to extend its capabilities
- **Terminal-native workflow**: Works alongside your existing tools, editor, and shell without replacing them
- **Agent autonomy**: Full-auto mode, background agents, `/loop` for scheduled tasks, voice mode, and session resume
- **IDE integration**: Also available in VS Code, JetBrains, and as a desktop app

**Pricing:** Requires an Anthropic Max ($20/mo for Sonnet, $100/mo for Opus with 1M context), Team ($30/seat/mo), or Enterprise plan. API access also available with per-token billing.

**MCP integration:** Claude Code has the deepest MCP integration of any tool — it was built by the team that created the protocol. You can connect multiple MCP servers, use [custom hooks](/guides/what-is-mcp/), and the tool itself can act as an MCP client for external services.

**Best for:** Developers who prefer terminal workflows, need deep reasoning on complex codebases, or want maximum flexibility through MCP integrations. Particularly strong for autonomous multi-file changes, architectural refactoring, and tasks requiring sustained reasoning across large contexts.

**Limitations:** Terminal-first approach has a learning curve for GUI-oriented developers. No inline autocomplete — it's an agent, not a copilot.

## Cursor

**What it is:** With the [Cursor 3 release](https://cursor.com/changelog/3-0) (April 2, 2026), Cursor has shifted from a VS Code fork with AI features to an agent-first platform. The new Agents Window lets you manage multiple parallel agents across repos and environments, while the traditional IDE remains available alongside it.

**Key strengths:**
- **Agents Window**: Run many agents in parallel across repos and environments — locally, in worktrees, in the cloud, and on remote SSH. Switch back to the IDE anytime or have both open simultaneously
- **Supermaven autocomplete**: Multi-line predictions with project-wide context and auto-imports — widely considered the best inline completion experience
- **Design Mode**: Annotate and target UI elements directly in the browser, giving agents precise visual feedback
- **Background Agents**: Ship tasks to cloud-based agents that work asynchronously and open PRs
- **New agent commands**: `/worktree` creates isolated git worktrees for changes; `/best-of-n` runs the same task across multiple models in parallel, then compares outcomes
- **Bugbot**: Automated code review with 78% resolution rate, MCP support, and self-improvement from PR feedback

**Pricing:** Free (Hobby), Pro ($20/mo with credit pool), Pro+ ($60/mo, 3x credits), Ultra ($200/mo, 20x credits), Teams ($40/seat/mo). Credit-based billing since June 2025 — auto mode is unlimited, premium model selection draws from credits.

**MCP integration:** Supports MCP servers for extending capabilities, including in Bugbot for automated code review. MCP Apps now support structured content for richer tool outputs.

**Best for:** Developers who want the best autocomplete experience combined with agent capabilities. The Cursor 3 Agents Window makes it particularly strong for orchestrating multiple tasks across different repos simultaneously.

**Limitations:** The credit system can be confusing. Premium model usage drains credits faster, making costs unpredictable for heavy users. The Cursor 3 agent-first paradigm is a significant shift — developers who just want an IDE with completions may find it overkill.

## GitHub Copilot

**What it is:** GitHub's AI coding assistant, available as an extension for VS Code, JetBrains, Neovim, and other editors, plus a web-based Copilot Workspace for autonomous task execution.

**Key strengths:**
- **Deepest GitHub integration**: Pull request summaries, issue context, repository knowledge — it lives where your code already lives
- **Autopilot mode** (preview): Fully autonomous agent sessions where the agent approves its own actions, auto-retries on errors, and works until the task completes with no manual approvals required
- **Agent Mode**: Shipped with MCP support, turning Copilot from a completion tool into an autonomous agent
- **Copilot Workspace**: Reads entire codebases, plans multi-file solutions, writes code, runs tests, and opens PRs from natural language
- **Model choice**: Pro+ tier includes Claude Opus 4, OpenAI o3, and other frontier models
- **Enterprise features**: Organizational policies, knowledge bases, fine-tuning on private repos
- **Copilot SDK** (preview): Embed Copilot's agentic capabilities directly into your own applications

**Pricing:** Free (2,000 completions + 50 premium requests/mo), Pro ($10/mo, 300 premium requests), Pro+ ($39/mo, 1,500 premium requests), Business ($19/seat/mo), Enterprise ($39/seat/mo, requires GitHub Enterprise Cloud).

**MCP integration:** Agent Mode supports MCP servers, allowing you to connect external tools and services directly into Copilot workflows.

**Best for:** Teams already deep in the GitHub ecosystem. The $10/mo Pro tier is the cheapest entry point for a capable AI coding assistant with unlimited completions. Enterprise teams benefit from centralized management and policy controls.

**Limitations:** The free and Pro tiers have limited premium requests, which gate access to better models and agent features. Agent capabilities trail behind dedicated agentic tools like Claude Code and Cursor.

## Windsurf

**What it is:** An agentic IDE (formerly Codeium) built on VS Code, positioning itself as the first IDE designed around AI "flow state" — where developer and AI work together continuously.

**Key strengths:**
- **Cascade**: The AI agent for multi-file edits, codebase reasoning, and refactoring — fully agentic from the start
- **Fast Context**: Proprietary indexing that builds deep understanding of project structure, dependencies, and patterns
- **Memories**: Over ~48 hours of use, it learns your architecture patterns and coding conventions, improving accuracy over time
- **Competitive pricing**: Pro at $15/mo is the cheapest agentic IDE option
- **Unlimited autocomplete**: Tab completions are free on every plan, including the free tier

**Pricing:** Free, Pro ($15/mo), Teams ($30/seat/mo), Enterprise (custom). Switched from credits to quotas in March 2026 — simpler billing model.

**MCP integration:** Supports MCP servers for connecting external tools and data sources to Cascade workflows.

**Best for:** Developers who want agentic capabilities at the lowest price point. The Memories feature is particularly useful for long-term projects where the AI builds up context over time. Good entry point for developers new to AI-assisted coding.

**Limitations:** Cascade can be aggressive — sometimes making changes you didn't ask for. The Memories feature needs time to become useful. Smaller community and extension ecosystem compared to Cursor.

## OpenAI Codex

**What it is:** An open-source terminal coding agent from OpenAI, running locally in your shell. Also available as Codex Web through ChatGPT.

**Key strengths:**
- **Open source**: Apache 2.0 license, 67,000+ GitHub stars, 400+ contributors — you can inspect and modify the code
- **Token efficiency**: Claims ~4x more token-efficient than Claude Code, stretching your API budget further
- **Speed**: [GPT-5.3-Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/changelog) combines frontier coding performance with stronger reasoning, running 25% faster than its predecessor. Codex-Spark delivers 1,000+ tokens per second (research preview for Pro users)
- **OS-level sandboxing**: Seatbelt (macOS), Landlock + seccomp (Linux) for secure execution
- **Flexible access**: Use through ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo) or bring your own API key with per-token billing

**Pricing:** The tool is free (open source). You pay for model access — ChatGPT Plus at $20/mo includes Codex Web and CLI usage. API pricing: codex-mini at $1.50/$6.00 per M tokens, GPT-5 at $1.25/$10.00 per M tokens.

**MCP integration:** Supports MCP servers for extending capabilities with external tools.

**Best for:** Developers who value open source, want to customize their agent, or need maximum token efficiency. The ChatGPT Plus bundle gives you web + CLI access, making it a good value proposition.

**Limitations:** Reasoning depth trails Claude Code on complex architectural tasks. The open-source nature means more setup and configuration. Web interface is less polished than dedicated IDEs.

## Amazon Kiro

**What it is:** An AI IDE from Amazon that uses spec-driven development — it generates requirements and design documents before writing code, then implements from the approved spec.

**Key strengths:**
- **Spec-driven development**: Before writing code, Kiro generates requirements and design docs for your review. Once approved, it implements from a structured plan — reducing "vibe coding" drift
- **AWS integration**: Native AWS observability, CloudFormation/CDK support, and tight integration with AWS services
- **Steering rules**: Guide AI behavior across your project with persistent configuration
- **Model flexibility**: Supports Claude (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus), DeepSeek, MiniMax, and Qwen models with different credit multipliers

**Pricing:** Free (50 credits), Pro ($20/mo, 1,000 credits), Pro+ ($40/mo, 2,000 credits), Power ($200/mo, 10,000 credits). New users get 500 bonus credits. Additional credits at $0.04 each.

**MCP integration:** Full MCP support for connecting specialized tools and external services.

**Best for:** Teams building on AWS who want structured, spec-driven development. The requirements-first approach is valuable for enterprise projects where documentation and planning matter. Good for developers who find pure agent mode too unpredictable.

**Limitations:** Spec-driven approach adds overhead for small, quick tasks. AWS integration is a strength but also a bias — non-AWS workflows get less attention. Smaller ecosystem than Cursor or Copilot.

## Google Antigravity

**What it is:** Google's agentic development platform, available as a standalone IDE and integrated into Google AI Studio. Features a dual-interface architecture with an Editor view and a Manager view for orchestrating multiple parallel agents.

**Key strengths:**
- **Parallel agents**: The Manager View lets you dispatch multiple agents to work on different tasks simultaneously — unique among coding tools
- **Auditable artifacts**: Agents generate verifiable deliverables (task lists, plans, screenshots, browser recordings) rather than opaque tool calls
- **Knowledge Base**: Agents save useful context and code snippets to improve future tasks — learning is a core primitive
- **AgentKit 2.0**: 16 specialized agents, 40+ domain-specific skills, and 11 pre-configured commands for frontend, backend, and testing
- **Google AI Studio integration**: Turn prompts into production apps with built-in Firebase support
- **Model variety**: Gemini 3.1 Pro, Gemini 3 Flash, Claude Sonnet 4.6, Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-OSS 120B

**Pricing:** Available through Google AI Studio (free tier available). Standalone IDE pricing varies by usage.

**MCP integration:** Antigravity now supports MCP servers, including a built-in [MCP Store](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/connect-google-antigravity-ide-to-googles-data-cloud-services) for discovering and installing integrations. Pre-built MCP servers connect agents to Google Data Cloud services (AlloyDB, BigQuery, Spanner, Cloud SQL, Looker) and Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Cloud Functions, Realtime Database). Third-party MCP servers are also supported via per-workspace configuration.

**Best for:** Developers in the Google/Firebase ecosystem who want parallel agent processing. The Manager View is genuinely novel — no other tool lets you run five agents on five tasks simultaneously with the same level of orchestration.

**Limitations:** Google ecosystem bias — MCP integrations are strongest for Google services. Newer than competitors, so community resources and third-party integrations are still catching up.

For a deeper look at MCP integration patterns, see our guide on [MCP across AI platforms](/guides/mcp-across-ai-platforms/).

### Autocomplete Quality

If inline code completion is your primary use case:

1. **Cursor** — Supermaven engine with multi-line predictions is widely considered best-in-class
2. **Windsurf** — Tab completions are unlimited and free on every plan
3. **GitHub Copilot** — Unlimited completions on all paid plans, the original AI autocomplete
4. **Kiro** — Solid completions powered by Claude models
5. **Claude Code / Codex** — Terminal agents, not autocomplete tools (different paradigm)
6. **Antigravity** — Completions available but not the primary focus

### Pricing Breakdown

For a solo developer:

| Tool | Cheapest Paid | Mid-Tier | Power User |
|------|--------------|----------|------------|
| Claude Code | $20/mo (Max Sonnet) | $100/mo (Max Opus 1M) | API billing |
| Cursor | $20/mo (Pro) | $60/mo (Pro+) | $200/mo (Ultra) |

**Cheapest entry:** GitHub Copilot Pro at $10/mo.
**Best value for agentic work:** Windsurf Pro at $15/mo.
**Best value for autocomplete + agent combo:** Cursor Pro at $20/mo.
**Most cost-predictable:** GitHub Copilot (fixed premium request counts, no credit surprises).

## Benchmarks: Take Them With a Grain of Salt

SWE-bench Verified is the most commonly cited benchmark for AI coding tools. As of April 2026, the top scores cluster closely:

- Gemini 3.1 Pro: 80.6%
- MiniMax M2.5: 80.2%
- Claude Sonnet 4.6: ~77%
- Claude Opus 4.5: 76.8%
- GPT-5.4: Strong on SWE-bench Pro (57.7%) and Terminal-Bench (75.1%)

**Why benchmarks are misleading for tool comparison:** The same model running through different agent scaffolding can score 50.2% to 55.4% — a spread that comes entirely from how the agent manages context and tool calls, not model capability. Infrastructure differences (CPU, memory, timeouts) can also swing results by several points. A tool's agent architecture matters as much as its underlying model.

The practical takeaway: all frontier models are competitive on coding tasks. Your experience will depend more on the tool's UX, agent architecture, and integration with your workflow than on benchmark differences.

## Which Tool Should You Choose?

**Choose Claude Code if** you prefer terminal workflows, need the deepest reasoning on complex codebases, want maximum MCP extensibility, or are building autonomous agent workflows. The `/loop` scheduled tasks feature is unique and powerful for ongoing development operations.

**Choose Cursor if** you write code daily and want the best combination of autocomplete and agent capabilities. Cursor 3's Agents Window lets you orchestrate multiple agents across repos, while Supermaven autocomplete handles fast inline completions.

**Choose GitHub Copilot if** your team lives in the GitHub ecosystem, you want the cheapest entry point ($10/mo), or you need enterprise-grade management and policies. The GitHub integration depth is unmatched.

**Choose Windsurf if** you want agentic capabilities at the lowest price, are new to AI-assisted coding, or work on long-term projects where the Memories feature can compound value over time.

**Choose OpenAI Codex if** you value open source, want to customize your agent, or need the most token-efficient terminal agent. The ChatGPT Plus bundle is good value.

**Choose Amazon Kiro if** you're building on AWS and want structured, spec-driven development. The requirements-first approach adds discipline that pure agent mode lacks.

**Choose Google Antigravity if** you're in the Google/Firebase ecosystem and want to run multiple parallel agents. The Manager View orchestration is genuinely novel, and MCP Store integrations connect directly to Google Data Cloud services.

## The Bigger Picture

The 2026 AI coding landscape has converged on a common architecture: autocomplete for fast typing, agent mode for complex tasks, and MCP for extensibility — all seven tools now support MCP. The differentiation is shifting from "can it write code?" to:

- **How does it integrate with your existing workflow?** (Terminal vs IDE, GitHub vs AWS vs Google)
- **How autonomous can it be?** (Background agents, scheduled tasks, parallel processing)
- **How extensible is it?** (MCP support, custom tools, plugin ecosystems)
- **How predictable is the cost?** (Credits vs quotas vs fixed plans)

Most developers will end up using more than one tool. Claude Code for complex refactoring, Cursor for daily coding, Copilot for PR reviews — these are complementary, not mutually exclusive. The right question isn't "which is the best?" but "which combination fits how I work?"

For more on how MCP is shaping this ecosystem, see our guides on [what MCP is](/guides/what-is-mcp/), [MCP across AI platforms](/guides/mcp-across-ai-platforms/), and [MCP vs CLI for AI agents](/guides/mcp-vs-cli-ai-agents/).

## Frequently asked questions

**Which AI coding assistant is best for beginners?**

Windsurf or GitHub Copilot. Windsurf has the lowest price ($15/mo with generous limits) and its Cascade agentic mode guides you through multi-step tasks without needing to understand the details. GitHub Copilot ($10/mo) integrates into VS Code, which most beginners already use, and its autocomplete is excellent for learning patterns. Claude Code requires terminal comfort, and Cursor assumes IDE familiarity.

**Can I use multiple AI coding tools together?**

Yes, and most developers do. A common setup: Claude Code for complex refactoring and multi-file changes, Cursor for daily coding with fast autocomplete, and GitHub Copilot for PR reviews. Since MCP servers work across tools, your custom integrations are portable. The tools complement each other rather than compete.

**How much do AI coding assistants cost in 2026?**

GitHub Copilot starts at $10/month. Windsurf is $15/month. Cursor Pro is $20/month. Claude Code is $20/month for Max (or pay-per-use via API). OpenAI Codex is included with ChatGPT Pro ($200/month) or Plus ($20/month with limits). Amazon Kiro and Google Antigravity are free during preview. Most offer free tiers with limited usage.

**What is MCP and why does it matter for coding tools?**

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard created by Anthropic that lets AI coding tools connect to external services — databases, APIs, cloud platforms, design tools — through a standardized interface. A single MCP server works across Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, and other compatible tools. This means your integrations are portable and you're not locked into one vendor's ecosystem.

**Which AI coding tool has the best agent mode?**

Claude Code and Cursor lead in agent capabilities. Claude Code runs as a terminal agent that can autonomously read codebases, edit files, run commands, and iterate on complex multi-file tasks — plus it offers unique scheduled tasks via `/loop`. Cursor's Composer agent mode works within its IDE with strong autocomplete support. Windsurf's Cascade is capable but less autonomous. Google Antigravity's parallel agent execution is novel but still in preview.
