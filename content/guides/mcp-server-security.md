MCP servers connect your AI assistant to external tools and data. That connection is powerful — and risky. Every MCP server you install becomes a bridge between an AI model and your systems: your databases, your files, your cloud infrastructure.

We've [reviewed 19 MCP servers](/reviews/) across every major category. Along the way, we found SQL injection vulnerabilities, SSRF bugs, prompt injection attacks, and servers that store credentials in plaintext. This guide distills what we learned into practical security advice.

## Why MCP Security Matters More Than You Think

When you install a traditional CLI tool, it does what you tell it. When you install an MCP server, an AI model decides what it does. The model interprets natural language, picks tools, and constructs arguments — all without you specifying exact commands.

This creates a new threat surface:

- **The AI can be tricked.** Prompt injection can cause an agent to call tools in unintended ways.
- **Permissions compound.** If your agent has access to both a file system server and a web server, a prompt injection in fetched web content could lead to file operations.
- **Servers trust their callers.** Most MCP servers assume the client is well-behaved. There's no built-in mechanism to verify that a tool call reflects genuine user intent.

OWASP recognized these risks by publishing a dedicated [MCP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-mcp-top-10/) and two practical guides: one for [using third-party servers](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/cheatsheet-a-practical-guide-for-securely-using-third-party-mcp-servers-1-0/) and one for [building secure servers](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/a-practical-guide-for-secure-mcp-server-development/).

## The Three Security Questions

Before installing any MCP server, ask:

1. **What can it access?** A database server can read your data. A file system server can read your code. A web fetch server can reach internal network addresses. Know the blast radius.

2. **Who authenticates?** Is it using OAuth with scoped tokens, or a long-lived API key pasted into a JSON config file? How are credentials stored?

3. **What happens if the AI makes a mistake?** If the model hallucinates a tool argument or gets prompt-injected, what's the worst-case outcome? Can it delete data? Send messages? Execute arbitrary SQL?

## Authentication: The Shift to OAuth 2.1

The MCP ecosystem is in the middle of a major authentication transition. The June 2025 spec revision formalized MCP servers as **OAuth 2.1 Resource Servers**, separating them from authorization servers entirely. The November 2025 revision made PKCE mandatory for all clients.

What this means in practice:

**Remote servers (the new standard)** — hosted by the vendor, authenticate via OAuth in the browser. No tokens on disk, short-lived sessions, revocable access. Examples from our reviews: [Sentry](/reviews/sentry-mcp-server/) (at `mcp.sentry.dev`), [Neon](/reviews/neon-mcp-server/) (at `mcp.neon.tech`), [Supabase](/reviews/supabase-mcp-server/) (at `mcp.supabase.com`), [Slack](/reviews/slack-mcp-server/) (at `mcp.slack.com`), [Vercel](/reviews/vercel-mcp-server/) (at `mcp.vercel.com`).

**Local servers (legacy pattern)** — run as a subprocess on your machine, often configured with API keys or tokens in `claude_desktop_config.json` or similar files. These tokens are long-lived, stored in plaintext, and often over-scoped. Examples: [GitHub MCP](/reviews/github-mcp-server/) (Personal Access Token), [Brave Search](/reviews/brave-search-mcp-server/) (API key), [EverArt](/reviews/everart-mcp-server/) (API key).

**The transition isn't complete.** Some servers like [Notion](/reviews/notion-mcp-server/) offer both: a local server with integration tokens (being sunset) and a remote OAuth server. Others like [Filesystem MCP](/reviews/filesystem-mcp-server/) and [Memory MCP](/reviews/memory-mcp-server/) are inherently local and don't need external auth — but lack other controls.

### What Good Authentication Looks Like

| Feature | Good | Bad |
|---------|------|-----|
| Token lifetime | Short-lived, auto-refreshing | Long-lived, never expires |
| Storage | In-memory or secure keychain | Plaintext in JSON config |
| Scope | Minimal — only what's needed | Full account access |
| Revocation | One-click in provider dashboard | Requires token regeneration |
| Rotation | Automatic | Manual |

The best example we reviewed: **Supabase MCP** uses OAuth 2.1 at `mcp.supabase.com`, requires no PAT, and provides a real PostgreSQL read-only role (not just client-side filtering). The worst: **PostgreSQL MCP** (archived) accepted raw connection strings with no access controls at all.

## Real Vulnerabilities We Found

These aren't theoretical. We discovered these while reviewing production MCP servers:

### SQL Injection — PostgreSQL MCP Server

The [PostgreSQL MCP server](/reviews/postgres-mcp-server/) claimed read-only protection by wrapping queries in a transaction. But multi-statement SQL bypasses this entirely:

```sql
SELECT 1; COMMIT; DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; --
```

The server executes the `COMMIT`, ending the read-only transaction, then runs the destructive command. This server was archived in May 2025 with no patch — yet it still gets 21,000 weekly npm downloads.

**Lesson:** Client-side SQL safety is not real safety. Use database-level roles with restricted permissions, like Supabase's read-only PostgreSQL role.

### SSRF — Fetch MCP Server

The [Fetch MCP server](/reviews/fetch-mcp-server/) has no protection against Server-Side Request Forgery. An agent can fetch internal addresses:

```
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/  (AWS metadata)
http://localhost:8080/admin                (local services)
http://10.0.0.1/                           (internal network)
```

A fix (PR #3180) was proposed but hasn't been merged as of March 2026.

**Lesson:** Any tool that makes HTTP requests needs URL validation. Block private IP ranges, cloud metadata endpoints, and localhost by default.

### Prompt Injection — Context7 MCP Server

[Context7](/reviews/context7-mcp-server/) had a "ContextCrush" vulnerability: anyone could register libraries on the platform with malicious instructions embedded in documentation. When an agent fetched those docs, the injected prompts could instruct it to read `.env` files, exfiltrate credentials, or delete files.

The vulnerability was patched within five days of disclosure (reported Feb 18, fixed Feb 23, 2026). But it illustrates an architectural risk: any centralized registry that feeds content to AI agents is a prompt injection target.

**Lesson:** Treat all external content as untrusted input. Centralized registries need content scanning and sandboxed execution.

## Security Checklist for MCP Servers

Use this when evaluating any MCP server:

## How Our Reviewed Servers Stack Up

We rated the security posture of all 19 servers we've reviewed, from strongest to weakest:

### Strong Security

**[Supabase MCP](/reviews/supabase-mcp-server/)** (4/5) — The best security model we reviewed. Real PostgreSQL read-only role, feature group filtering, OAuth 2.1, project-level scoping. Their approach to read-only mode sets the standard: it's a database-level restriction, not client-side filtering.

**[Sentry MCP](/reviews/sentry-mcp-server/)** (4/5) — OAuth-first design, organization scoping, 748+ issues suggest thorough real-world testing. First-party remote server with enterprise compliance options.

**[Slack MCP](/reviews/slack-mcp-server/)** (4/5) — Granular OAuth scopes, admin oversight, audit logging. The scope model lets you limit access to specific channels and operations.

**[Neon MCP](/reviews/neon-mcp-server/)** (4/5) — OAuth remote server, project-level scoping, branch-based workflow means mistakes are isolated to branches. Deprecated their less-secure local API key approach.

**[Vercel MCP](/reviews/vercel-mcp-server/)** (3.5/5) — Client allowlisting prevents confused deputy attacks. OAuth at `mcp.vercel.com` with project-specific URLs.

### Adequate Security

**[GitHub MCP](/reviews/github-mcp-server/)** (4/5) — Toolset-based enablement, active maintenance. But PAT scoping is confusing and tokens are long-lived in config files. Rate limiting is invisible to agents.

**[Brave Search MCP](/reviews/brave-search-mcp-server/)** (4/5) — API key auth but well-scoped (search-only). Tool filtering via environment variables. Privacy-first: queries aren't fed to ad models.

**[Filesystem MCP](/reviews/filesystem-mcp-server/)** (4/5) — Directory allowlisting at startup is a clean model. But no per-agent segmentation and no encryption of accessed files.

**[Playwright MCP](/reviews/playwright-mcp-server/)** (4.5/5) — Zero-config with optional auth state persistence. Browser sandbox provides isolation. But saved auth state is plaintext JSON.

**[Notion MCP](/reviews/notion-mcp-server/)** (3.5/5) — Transitioning to OAuth remote server. But tokens expire frequently (3+ times/week per Issue #225), and there's no easy database-level scoping.

**[Figma Dev Mode MCP](/reviews/figma-dev-mode-mcp-server/)** (3.5/5) — OAuth remote server with aggressive rate limiting (6 calls/month free tier). The rate limiting, while frustrating, provides a natural security boundary.

### Weak Security

**[Memory MCP](/reviews/memory-mcp-server/)** (3.5/5) — Plaintext JSONL file on disk with no encryption, no access controls, no isolation between contexts. Fine for personal use; dangerous for anything shared.

**[Fetch MCP](/reviews/fetch-mcp-server/)** (3/5) — Unpatched SSRF vulnerability. No URL allowlisting. Use the community alternative [zcaceres/fetch-mcp](https://github.com/zcaceres/fetch-mcp) for SSRF protection.

**[Context7 MCP](/reviews/context7-mcp-server/)** (3.5/5) — ContextCrush patched, but centralized registry architecture is inherently a prompt injection target. Rate limits slashed 83% in January 2026.

**[SQLite MCP](/reviews/sqlite-mcp-server/)** (3/5) — No parameterized queries, no encryption, development-only. Archived but still useful for local prototyping.

**[EverArt MCP](/reviews/everart-mcp-server/)** (2.5/5) — Archived, API key auth, minimal documentation. Don't use in production.

### Dangerous

**[PostgreSQL MCP](/reviews/postgres-mcp-server/)** (2.5/5) — **Do not use.** Exploitable SQL injection vulnerability, archived with no patch. Switch to [Postgres MCP Pro](https://github.com/crystaldba/postgres-mcp) or use [Supabase MCP](/reviews/supabase-mcp-server/) or [Neon MCP](/reviews/neon-mcp-server/) instead.

## Best Practices for MCP Users

### 1. Prefer Remote OAuth Servers

When a vendor offers both a local server (with API keys) and a remote server (with OAuth), choose the remote server. It eliminates plaintext credentials, provides automatic token rotation, and gives the vendor visibility into usage patterns for abuse detection.

### 2. Scope Permissions Down

Don't give a GitHub MCP server full `repo` access if you only need pull request management. Don't connect Supabase MCP to your production project when you're exploring. Use the narrowest permissions that let you do your work.

### 3. Isolate by Context

Run different MCP servers for different projects. Don't use one Memory MCP instance across all your work. Don't connect your production database server and your web browsing server to the same agent session — a prompt injection from the web could reach your database.

### 4. Use Read-Only Modes

Start with read-only access and escalate only when needed. Supabase's `read_only=true` is the gold standard here — it's enforced at the database level. For other servers, check if they offer equivalent restrictions.

### 5. Audit Regularly

- Check which MCP servers are configured in your client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)
- Review the scopes and permissions each server has
- Remove servers you're no longer using
- Update servers that have security patches
- Check that archived servers haven't been replaced by safer alternatives

### 6. Watch for Red Flags

Be cautious of MCP servers that:
- Haven't been updated in 6+ months
- Have open security issues with no response
- Require full admin/root access to function
- Store credentials in plaintext with no alternative
- Are the only maintainer's side project with no community review

## The Shadow IT Problem

[Qualys warned in March 2026](https://blog.qualys.com/product-tech/2026/03/19/mcp-servers-shadow-it-ai-qualys-totalai-2026) that MCP servers are becoming a new form of shadow IT in enterprises. Servers bind to localhost on random ports, started as experiments, and quietly became production dependencies — without formal security review or ownership.

The risks go beyond the servers themselves:

- **Reconnaissance exposure.** Even a read-only MCP endpoint leaks internal system names, tool schemas, resource paths, and namespace structures. An attacker who discovers an MCP server gets a map of what it connects to.
- **Execution surface.** If an agent can be prompt-injected, every tool the server exposes becomes an attack vector — opening tickets, triggering deployments, running queries, changing configurations.
- **Static credentials at scale.** Qualys cites research showing 53% of servers rely on static secrets, creating systemic risk across downstream systems.
- **No inventory.** Most organizations don't know how many MCP servers are running, who started them, or what they connect to.

The [MCP Dev Summit 2026](/guides/mcp-dev-summit-2026-guide/) dedicated its largest track (23 sessions) to security and operations, reflecting how central this concern has become. Key sessions covered mix-up attacks, host-layer security, and real-world MCP server exploitation.

### What Organizations Should Do

Qualys recommends a four-step operational playbook:

1. **Clarify ownership.** Distinguish production MCP deployments from experiments. Assign an owner to each.
2. **Map exposure.** Understand network accessibility and segmentation gaps — which servers are reachable from where?
3. **Enforce authentication.** Separate discovery privileges from invocation privileges. Don't let unauthenticated clients call tools.
4. **Implement observability.** Log tool invocations, monitor for anomalous patterns, and alert on unexpected server launches.

## Tool Poisoning: The Hidden Threat

Tool poisoning is a specialized form of prompt injection where malicious instructions hide inside MCP tool metadata — descriptions, parameter names, and even tool outputs. The AI model follows these instructions while the user sees nothing unusual. Researchers at Invariant Labs and CyberArk have demonstrated working attacks that exfiltrate SSH keys, redirect emails, and steal credentials from Claude Desktop and Cursor.

This is serious enough that OWASP lists it as [MCP03](https://owasp.org/www-project-mcp-top-10/) in their MCP Top 10, and Invariant Labs built [mcp-scan](https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/mcp-scan) — a dedicated scanner that detects tool poisoning, rug pulls, and cross-origin escalation.

**We've written a full deep-dive:** [MCP Tool Poisoning Attacks: How They Work and How to Defend Against Them](/guides/mcp-tool-poisoning-attacks/) covers five attack vectors (description poisoning, tool shadowing, full-schema poisoning, output poisoning, and rug pulls), the research behind them, and a practical defense checklist.

## What's Next for MCP Security

The protocol is maturing rapidly. The November 2025 spec revision mandated PKCE for all clients and introduced Client ID Metadata Documents for standardized registration. OWASP's MCP Top 10 gives the ecosystem a shared vocabulary for risks.

But gaps remain. There's no standard for:
- **Per-tool authorization** — you can't grant access to `read_file` but not `write_file` within the same server at the protocol level
- **Audit logging** — no standard format for recording which tools were called, with what arguments, by which agent
- **Content integrity** — no way to verify that a server's responses haven't been tampered with

Until these gaps close, the responsibility falls on users and server developers to implement security at the application level. The checklist above is a starting point. Our [individual reviews](/reviews/) go deeper on each server's specific security posture.
