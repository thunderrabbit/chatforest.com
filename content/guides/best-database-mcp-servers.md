The official Anthropic database MCP servers — both SQLite and PostgreSQL — are archived. No security patches, no updates, and in Postgres's case, a [SQL injection vulnerability that bypasses read-only protection](/reviews/postgres-mcp-server/). If you're still using them, it's time to switch.

The good news: the community has built better alternatives. Here's how they compare, and which one you should use.

## The Contenders

| Server | Database | Rating | Best For |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| [Neon MCP](/reviews/neon-mcp-server/) | Neon Postgres | 4/5 | Cloud Postgres with AI workflows |
| [Official SQLite MCP](/reviews/sqlite-mcp-server/) | SQLite | 3/5 | Learning MCP only |
| [Official Postgres MCP](/reviews/postgres-mcp-server/) | PostgreSQL | 2.5/5 | Nothing (vulnerable) |
| Postgres MCP Pro (crystaldba) | PostgreSQL | — | Self-hosted production Postgres |
| MotherDuck DuckDB MCP | DuckDB | — | Analytics & data pipelines |
| DBHub (Bytebase) | Multi-database | — | Multi-database workflows |
| jparkerweb/mcp-sqlite | SQLite | — | SQLite in production |

## Why the Official Servers Failed

Both official database MCP servers share the same story: built as reference implementations, archived when the MCP ecosystem matured past them.

**The SQLite server** is clean, educational code with a clever insight memo feature. But it has zero safety guardrails — `DROP TABLE` executes without hesitation. It was never meant for production, and now it never will be. [Read our full review](/reviews/sqlite-mcp-server/).

**The PostgreSQL server** is worse. Its entire value proposition — read-only database access — is broken by a SQL injection vulnerability. `COMMIT; DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE;` escapes the read-only transaction. The npm package at v0.6.2 still gets 21,000 weekly downloads. [Read our full review](/reviews/postgres-mcp-server/).

If you're using either of these, stop. Not eventually — now.

## The Replacements

### For Cloud Postgres: Neon MCP

**[Neon MCP](/reviews/neon-mcp-server/)** (4/5) is Neon's first-party MCP server for their serverless Postgres platform. With 20 tools, OAuth authentication, and a hosted remote server at `mcp.neon.tech`, it's the most capable database MCP server we've reviewed.

**The killer feature:** branch-based migrations. When your agent runs a migration, Neon creates an instant copy-on-write branch from your production data. The migration runs on this branch first. Your agent verifies the results, then merges to the main branch — or discards the branch if something went wrong. No rollback scripts, no downtime risk.

**What it offers:**
- Project management (create, list, describe, delete projects)
- Branch-based migration workflows (prepare → verify → complete)
- SQL execution and transactions
- Query tuning with EXPLAIN analysis and branch-based optimization
- Schema inspection (tables, columns, constraints)
- OAuth 2.0 authentication (no API keys on disk)
- Built-in documentation access

**Setup (remote, recommended):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "neon": {
      "url": "https://mcp.neon.tech/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**The catch:** Neon-only. This server works exclusively with Neon's serverless Postgres. If your database is on RDS, Supabase, or self-hosted, use Postgres MCP Pro instead. [Read our full review](/reviews/neon-mcp-server/).

### For Self-Hosted PostgreSQL: Postgres MCP Pro

**[Postgres MCP Pro](https://github.com/crystaldba/postgres-mcp)** (crystaldba) is the community server that does everything the official one should have done. 2,300+ GitHub stars, actively maintained, and designed for real-world use.

**What it offers:**
- Schema exploration (list schemas, objects, table details)
- SQL execution with configurable read-only mode that actually works
- EXPLAIN plan analysis — see how PostgreSQL will execute your query before running it
- Index tuning based on an industrial-strength algorithm (originally developed for Microsoft SQL Server)
- Database health checks: unused indexes, duplicate indexes, bloated indexes, buffer cache hit rates, connection issues
- Hypothetical index simulation — test whether an index would help without creating it

**Setup:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postgres": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm",
        "crystaldba/postgres-mcp",
        "--access-mode=unrestricted",
        "--connection-string=postgresql://user:pass@host/db"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Why it wins:** It's not just a query tool — it's a database advisor. The EXPLAIN analysis and index tuning tools mean your agent can diagnose slow queries, not just run them. The health check alone justifies switching from the official server.

### For Analytics: MotherDuck DuckDB MCP

**[MotherDuck DuckDB MCP](https://github.com/motherduckdb/mcp-server-motherduck)** is the official DuckDB server, backed by MotherDuck. If your workload is analytical — aggregations, joins across large datasets, Parquet/CSV ingestion — DuckDB is purpose-built for it.

**What it offers:**
- SQL execution against local DuckDB files, in-memory databases, S3-hosted databases, or MotherDuck cloud
- Read-only by default, `--read-write` flag for write access
- Results limited to 1,024 rows / 50,000 chars by default (configurable)
- Native support for Parquet, CSV, and JSON file formats
- DuckDB's analytical SQL extensions (window functions, QUALIFY, LIST aggregates)

**Setup:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "duckdb": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-motherduck"]
    }
  }
}
```

Set the `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` environment variable for MotherDuck cloud access, or use a local `.duckdb` file path.

**Why it wins:** DuckDB handles analytical queries that would bring SQLite to its knees. SUM over a million rows, GROUP BY across ten columns, joins between Parquet files on S3 — these are DuckDB's bread and butter. The MCP server inherits all of this with sensible defaults (read-only, row limits).

### For Multiple Databases: DBHub

**[DBHub](https://github.com/bytebase/dbhub)** (Bytebase) takes a different approach: one MCP server for all your databases. PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, SQLite — all through a single interface.

**What it offers:**
- Two tools: `execute_sql` and `search_objects` — deliberately minimal for token efficiency
- Multi-connection support via TOML configuration — connect to dev, staging, and production simultaneously
- Zero external dependencies
- Built-in web interface for debugging and query inspection
- Works with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Copilot CLI

**Setup:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dbhub": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@bytebase/dbhub", "--dsn", "postgresql://user:pass@host/db"]
    }
  }
}
```

For multiple databases, use a TOML config file:
```toml
[[database]]
name = "production"
dsn = "postgresql://user:pass@prod-host/mydb"

[[database]]
name = "staging"
dsn = "postgresql://user:pass@staging-host/mydb"

[[database]]
name = "local-sqlite"
dsn = "sqlite:///path/to/local.db"
```

**Why it wins:** If your agent needs to touch more than one database — cross-reference production and staging, migrate data between MySQL and Postgres, query a local SQLite cache alongside a remote Postgres instance — DBHub handles all of it without running five separate MCP servers.

### For SQLite Specifically: jparkerweb/mcp-sqlite

**[jparkerweb/mcp-sqlite](https://github.com/jparkerweb/mcp-sqlite)** is the community replacement for the official SQLite server. TypeScript, actively maintained, with structured CRUD operations instead of raw SQL.

**What it offers:**
- Input validation and structured operations (not raw SQL strings)
- Table creation, reading, updating, deleting with proper safeguards
- Schema inspection
- Actively maintained with regular updates

**Why it wins over the official server:** It actually validates inputs. The official server runs whatever SQL you hand it. This one provides structured operations that prevent the "oops, the agent ran DROP TABLE" scenario.

## Our Recommendations

### You have a PostgreSQL database → Postgres MCP Pro

No contest. It's the most capable database MCP server available — query execution, EXPLAIN analysis, index tuning, health checks. The configurable access modes (restricted vs. unrestricted) give you actual safety controls. If you're doing anything with PostgreSQL, this is the one to install.

### You're doing data analysis → DuckDB (MotherDuck)

If your agent is analyzing data — running aggregations, processing CSVs or Parquet files, building reports — DuckDB is the right engine. It's an order of magnitude faster than SQLite or Postgres for analytical workloads, and the MCP server has sensible defaults (read-only, output limits) that prevent runaway queries.

### You work across multiple databases → DBHub

If your workflow spans databases — maybe you're comparing staging vs. production, or your data lives in both MySQL and Postgres — DBHub's single-server-multiple-connections approach saves you from managing five separate MCP configurations. The trade-off is fewer specialized features (no EXPLAIN, no health checks), but the convenience is real.

### You need local SQLite → jparkerweb/mcp-sqlite

For quick local database work — prototyping, caching, small datasets — this is the SQLite MCP server to use. Input validation keeps agents from accidentally destroying data, and it's actively maintained.

### You're learning MCP → Official SQLite (read the code, don't run it)

The official SQLite server is still worth reading as a learning resource. The insight memo pattern, the schema-first workflow, the clean Python code — it's a good example of MCP server architecture. Just don't use it for anything real.

## Decision Flowchart

**What database engine are you using?**

- **PostgreSQL (Neon)** → [Neon MCP](/reviews/neon-mcp-server/)
- **PostgreSQL (self-hosted/RDS/other)** → Postgres MCP Pro
- **SQLite** → jparkerweb/mcp-sqlite
- **DuckDB** → MotherDuck DuckDB MCP
- **MySQL / MariaDB / SQL Server** → DBHub
- **Multiple databases** → DBHub

**What's your primary use case?**

- **Cloud Postgres with AI workflows** → [Neon MCP](/reviews/neon-mcp-server/) (branch-based migrations)
- **Querying a production database** → Postgres MCP Pro (restricted mode)
- **Data analysis / reporting** → DuckDB (MotherDuck)
- **Development / prototyping** → DBHub or jparkerweb/mcp-sqlite
- **Database performance tuning** → Postgres MCP Pro or Neon MCP (both have EXPLAIN + tuning)
- **Learning MCP** → Read the official SQLite server's source code

## The Bottom Line

The official database MCP servers served their purpose as reference implementations — they showed what was possible. But they're archived, one has a security vulnerability, and the community has built significantly better alternatives.

For most developers in 2026, the answer depends on your platform. **Neon MCP** (4/5) is the best experience if you're on Neon — branch-based migrations, OAuth, 20 tools. **Postgres MCP Pro** is the pick for self-hosted or other cloud PostgreSQL. **DuckDB** for analytics. **DBHub** for multi-database support. The ecosystem has matured, and the replacements are genuinely better than what came before.
