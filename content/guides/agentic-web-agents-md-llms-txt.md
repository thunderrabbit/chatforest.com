Websites were built for humans clicking links. Then they were optimized for search engine crawlers. Now a third audience has arrived: **AI agents that browse, interpret, and act autonomously.** And the web isn't ready for them.

The gap is real. An AI agent visiting your documentation site today faces the same problem a search engine faced in 1995 — no standardized way to understand what's available, what's allowed, and how to interact. Several emerging standards aim to fix this: **AGENTS.md** for codebases, **llms.txt** for websites, and **agenticweb.md** for rich agent interactions.

This guide covers what each standard does, when to use which, how they relate to protocols like [MCP](/guides/what-is-mcp/) and [A2A](/guides/mcp-vs-a2a-protocol-comparison/), and practical steps to make your site agent-ready. Our analysis draws on official specifications, published adoption data, and community documentation — we research and analyze rather than deploying these systems ourselves.

## The Problem: Websites Weren't Built for Agents

When a human visits a website, they see visual layout, navigation cues, and design conventions that guide their actions. When an AI agent visits the same site, it sees raw HTML — a soup of divs, scripts, and CSS classes that carries almost no semantic signal about what the site *does* or how to *use* it.

This creates several concrete problems:

- **Discovery**: The agent doesn't know what actions are available. Is there an API? Can it place an order? Can it book an appointment?
- **Permission**: The agent doesn't know what it's allowed to do. robots.txt tells crawlers where they can *read*, but says nothing about where they can *act*.
- **Context**: The agent lacks the background knowledge a human user brings. It doesn't know your product terminology, your workflow conventions, or your business rules.
- **Structure**: Documentation written for humans buries key information inside tutorials, marketing copy, and navigation menus that agents struggle to parse efficiently.

Each emerging standard addresses a different slice of this problem.

## AGENTS.md: Instructions for Coding Agents

### What It Is

[AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/) is a Markdown file placed in a code repository that gives AI coding agents the context they need to work on your project. Think of it as a README written specifically for AI assistants rather than human developers.

The format emerged from collaborative efforts across the AI development ecosystem, with backing from OpenAI (Codex), Google (Jules, Gemini CLI), Anthropic (Claude Code), Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and many others. By late 2025, over 60,000 open-source repositories had adopted AGENTS.md files, and adoption has continued to accelerate in 2026.

### What It Contains

AGENTS.md is deliberately simple — it's standard Markdown with no required schema. You write whatever instructions help agents work on your code. In practice, the most common sections include:

| Section | Purpose | Example Content |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Project overview** | What this project does and how it's structured | "This is a Next.js app with a Python FastAPI backend" |
| **Build and test** | How to build, test, and validate changes | "Run `npm test` before committing; all PRs must pass CI" |
| **Code style** | Conventions the agent should follow | "Use snake_case for Python, camelCase for TypeScript" |
| **Architecture** | How the codebase is organized | "API routes are in `src/api/`, database models in `src/models/`" |
| **Security** | What the agent must never do | "Never commit `.env` files or hardcode credentials" |
| **Testing** | What test coverage is expected | "Every new endpoint needs integration tests" |

### How Agents Discover It

Agents find AGENTS.md through directory tree traversal — they look for the nearest AGENTS.md file relative to the files being edited. This means:

- A root-level AGENTS.md applies to the whole repository
- Subdirectory AGENTS.md files override the parent for that subtree
- In monorepos, each package can have its own tailored instructions

This hierarchical model is elegant: general project rules go at the root, and specific overrides go where they're needed.

### Relationship to Similar Files

Several AI tools have their own configuration files:

| File | Tool | Scope |
|------|------|-------|
| **AGENTS.md** | Cross-platform standard | Any AI coding agent |
| **CLAUDE.md** | Claude Code (Anthropic) | Claude-specific instructions |
| **.cursorrules** | Cursor | Cursor-specific rules |
| **.github/copilot-instructions.md** | GitHub Copilot | Copilot-specific context |
| **rules/** or **.windsurfrules** | Windsurf | Windsurf-specific rules |

AGENTS.md aims to be the universal standard — write once, works everywhere. Tool-specific files remain useful for instructions that only apply to a particular agent. The typical approach is: put general instructions in AGENTS.md, and tool-specific overrides in the tool-specific file.

### Example

Here's a minimal but effective AGENTS.md:

```markdown
# AGENTS.md

## Overview
E-commerce API built with FastAPI and PostgreSQL. Monorepo with
`api/` (Python), `web/` (React), and `shared/` (protobuf definitions).

## Build & Test
- API: `cd api && make test` (requires running Postgres — see docker-compose.yml)
- Web: `cd web && npm test`
- Both must pass before any commit

## Code Style
- Python: Black formatter, isort for imports, type hints on all public functions
- TypeScript: Prettier, ESLint with our custom config
- Commit messages: conventional commits (feat:, fix:, chore:)

## Important Constraints
- Never modify migration files after they've been committed
- All API endpoints require authentication — no public routes
- Price calculations happen server-side only, never in the frontend
```

## llms.txt: Website Content for Language Models

### What It Is

[llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) is a proposal by Jeremy Howard (September 2024) to give language models a clean, structured summary of a website's content. Where AGENTS.md helps coding agents work on your *code*, llms.txt helps language models understand your *website*.

The file lives at `/llms.txt` on your domain (like `robots.txt`), and it's written in Markdown — deliberately, because language models parse Markdown more reliably than XML or JSON.

### What It Contains

The specification defines a specific structure:

1. **H1 heading** — the name of your project or site (required)
2. **Blockquote** — a short summary with key information needed to understand the rest
3. **Additional sections** — paragraphs, lists, or other Markdown (no sub-headings) with more detail
4. **Optional sections with links:**
   - Links to detailed documentation pages
   - Links to "optional" supplementary content

The idea is that an LLM can read just the llms.txt file and get enough context to understand your site, then follow specific links if it needs deeper information.

### llms.txt vs llms-full.txt

Some sites also provide `/llms-full.txt` — a complete dump of all documentation content in a single file. The tradeoff:

- **llms.txt**: Concise summary with links. Good for agents that need to understand what you offer before diving deep. Fits in smaller context windows.
- **llms-full.txt**: Everything in one file. Good for agents that need comprehensive context and have large context windows. More expensive to process.

### Adoption Status

As of early 2026, llms.txt remains a community-driven proposal rather than a formal standard (not IETF or W3C). Adoption is concentrated among tech companies and documentation-heavy sites — estimated at 5-15% of tech sites. Companies like Anthropic, Cursor, and Vercel have adopted it, lending it credibility in the AI-native ecosystem.

### Example

```markdown

```

## agenticweb.md: Rich Agent Interfaces for Websites

### What It Is

agenticweb.md is a newer, more ambitious proposal that goes beyond content summaries. While llms.txt tells an agent what your site *contains*, agenticweb.md tells an agent what your site *can do* — including APIs, interactive capabilities, authentication requirements, and multi-step workflows.

### What It Covers

The protocol aims to provide:

- **API endpoints and data formats** — what services are available programmatically
- **Interactive capabilities** — what actions an agent can perform
- **Security mechanisms** — authentication methods, rate limits, permissions
- **Semantic context** — business logic and data relationships
- **Workflow descriptions** — multi-step processes an agent can execute

### Current Status

agenticweb.md is still in early development as of March 2026. It's more of a vision statement than a mature specification — the exact file format, required fields, and tooling ecosystem are still being defined. It's worth watching but not yet ready for production adoption.

### Where It Fits

Think of the progression as increasing levels of agent capability:

| Standard | What It Enables | Maturity |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| **robots.txt** | "You may crawl these URLs" | Established standard |
| **llms.txt** | "Here's what our site contains" | Community proposal, growing adoption |
| **AGENTS.md** | "Here's how to work on our code" | Widely adopted (60,000+ repos) |
| **agenticweb.md** | "Here's what you can *do* on our site" | Early-stage proposal |

## How These Standards Relate to MCP and A2A

The emerging web standards and the AI agent protocols solve different layers of the same problem. Here's how they connect:

### The Stack

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Agent-to-Agent Communication (A2A) │  Agents coordinating with each other
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Tool Access (MCP)                  │  Agents using tools and APIs
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Website Discovery (llms.txt,       │  Agents understanding what's available
│  agenticweb.md)                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Codebase Guidance (AGENTS.md)      │  Agents working on code
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Practical Connections

**llms.txt → MCP**: A language model reads your llms.txt to understand your service, then uses an [MCP server](/guides/what-is-mcp/) to actually interact with your API. llms.txt provides the *discovery* layer; MCP provides the *action* layer.

**AGENTS.md → MCP tools**: A coding agent reads AGENTS.md to understand your project, then uses MCP-connected tools (databases, APIs, test runners) to make changes. AGENTS.md provides *project context*; MCP provides *tool access*.

**agenticweb.md → MCP + A2A**: In theory, agenticweb.md could describe capabilities that an agent accesses via MCP tools or delegates to other agents via [A2A](/guides/mcp-vs-a2a-protocol-comparison/). This is the most speculative connection — the integration patterns haven't been established yet.

**A2A Agent Cards → llms.txt**: A2A uses [Agent Cards](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/) (JSON at `/.well-known/agent.json`) for agent discovery — similar in spirit to llms.txt but for agent-to-agent scenarios. An agent's Agent Card describes its skills and capabilities; a website's llms.txt describes its content and structure.

## Making Your Site Agent-Ready: Practical Steps

Whether you're running a documentation site, an API service, or a content platform, here's how to prepare for agent traffic in 2026.

### Step 1: Audit Your robots.txt

Before adding new standards, make sure you're not accidentally blocking AI agents. Key bot names to be aware of:

- **GPTBot** (OpenAI)
- **ClaudeBot** (Anthropic)
- **Google-Extended** (Gemini)
- **PerplexityBot** (Perplexity)
- **Bytespider** (ByteDance)

If you want AI agents to find and use your content, ensure these aren't blocked. If you want to block some but allow others, robots.txt supports per-bot rules.

### Step 2: Add llms.txt

Create a `/llms.txt` file at your domain root with:

1. Your site name and a concise summary
2. Links to your most important pages (documentation, API reference, getting started)
3. Optionally, a `/llms-full.txt` with comprehensive content

Focus on what an AI agent would need to *understand your service* — not marketing copy, not navigation chrome, just the substance.

### Step 3: Add AGENTS.md to Your Repositories

If you maintain open-source code or any repository where AI agents might contribute:

1. Add an AGENTS.md at the repository root
2. Include build/test commands, code style rules, and architectural context
3. Add subdirectory AGENTS.md files for complex monorepos

This pays immediate dividends — developers using AI coding tools (Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor) on your project will get better results.

### Step 4: Structure Content for Machine Readability

Beyond specific files, general content practices that help agents:

- **Use semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy, meaningful element names
- **Provide structured data**: JSON-LD, OpenGraph, schema.org markup
- **Expose APIs**: If agents can interact with your service, document the API clearly
- **Version your content**: Include dates so agents know how current information is
- **Be explicit about limitations**: State what your service does and doesn't do — agents handle explicit boundaries better than implicit ones

### Step 5: Consider MCP Server Integration

If your service has an API, consider publishing an [MCP server](/guides/build-your-first-mcp-server/) that wraps it. This gives AI agents a standardized way to interact with your service beyond just reading content:

- Database services → [database MCP server](/guides/best-database-mcp-servers/)
- Content platforms → content management MCP server
- Developer tools → [DevOps MCP server](/guides/best-devops-mcp-servers/)
- Communication services → [messaging MCP server](/guides/best-communication-mcp-servers/)

## Decision Guide: Which Standards Do You Need?

| You Are... | Add This | Why |
|------------|----------|-----|
| **Open-source maintainer** | AGENTS.md | AI coding tools work better on your project |
| **Documentation site** | llms.txt | LLMs can understand and reference your docs |
| **API provider** | llms.txt + MCP server | Agents discover your service and interact with it |
| **Content publisher** | llms.txt | AI agents can accurately summarize and cite your content |
| **SaaS product** | llms.txt + AGENTS.md (for repos) | Full coverage for both users and contributors |
| **Enterprise internal** | AGENTS.md + internal llms.txt | Help internal AI tools work with your systems |

## What's Coming Next

The agentic web is evolving fast. Several trends to watch:

**Standard convergence**: AGENTS.md, llms.txt, and agenticweb.md may eventually merge or develop clear interoperability. The Linux Foundation's [Agentic AI Foundation](https://lfaidata.foundation/) (AAIF), which already governs MCP and A2A, is a likely home for web-facing standards too.

**Agent Card expansion**: A2A's Agent Card format (`/.well-known/agent.json`) could become the machine-readable complement to llms.txt — one for agent-to-agent discovery, one for agent-to-website discovery.

**Permission granularity**: Current standards are mostly about *discovery* and *context*. The next frontier is standardized *permission* systems — structured ways for sites to declare what agents can read, write, purchase, or modify. A [proposed AGENTS.md extension](https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md/issues/105) for structured tool permissions hints at this direction.

**Agentic SEO**: Just as SEO transformed how websites are structured for search engines, "Agentic AI Optimization" (AAIO) is emerging as a discipline focused on making sites discoverable and usable by AI agents. This includes llms.txt, structured data, API documentation, and content architecture decisions.

**Agent authentication**: As agents start *acting* on websites (not just reading), standardized authentication for AI agents becomes critical. OAuth 2.0 and API keys work for developer-built integrations, but agent-initiated access needs new patterns — likely building on [MCP's OAuth implementation](/guides/mcp-authorization-oauth/) and A2A's security model.

## Key Takeaways

1. **The web is gaining a new audience**: AI agents that browse, understand, and act — not just crawl and index
2. **Three standards are emerging**: AGENTS.md (code), llms.txt (websites), agenticweb.md (rich interactions) — each for a different use case
3. **They complement MCP and A2A**: Discovery standards help agents find and understand services; protocols like MCP and A2A handle the actual interaction
4. **Start with AGENTS.md and llms.txt**: Both are simple to implement and deliver immediate value with AI tools today
5. **The agentic web is early but real**: 60,000+ repos have AGENTS.md, major AI companies support llms.txt, and the infrastructure is being built now

The shift from "websites for humans" to "websites for humans *and* agents" is happening whether individual sites prepare for it or not. The standards described here are how you make sure agents interact with your site on your terms — not by scraping and guessing.
