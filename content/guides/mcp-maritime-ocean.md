The maritime industry is the backbone of global trade. [About 90% of world trade is carried by sea](https://ics-shipping.org/shipping-facts/shipping-and-world-trade), transported by [over 50,000 merchant ships trading internationally](https://unctad.org/publication/review-maritime-transport-2024) across a network of hundreds of major ports worldwide. Yet this enormous industry runs on remarkably fragmented data systems. AIS vessel tracking feeds live in one platform, weather and sea state data in another, port schedules in a third, customs and compliance databases elsewhere, and cargo tracking systems scattered across dozens of shipping lines and freight forwarders. A single container shipment from Shanghai to Rotterdam might touch 30+ different information systems before delivery.

The global AI-in-maritime market reached approximately [$4.3 billion in 2024](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/maritime-artificial-intelligence-market-report), growing at [15–40% CAGR depending on scope](https://www.technavio.com/report/maritime-ai-market-industry-analysis). The smart port and automated terminal market is forecast to reach [$11.2 billion by 2030](https://www.lucintel.com/smart-port-market.aspx), heading toward $22.4 billion by 2035. [Marine IoT is a $4.85 billion market growing to $12.31 billion by 2032](https://www.consegicbusinessintelligence.com/marine-internet-of-things-market). CMA CGM, the world's third-largest container shipping line, [announced a strategic partnership with Google](https://www.googlecloudpresscorner.com/2024-07-18-CMA-CGM-Embarks-on-a-Strategic-Partnership-with-Google-to-Deploy-AI-across-all-Shipping,-Logistics,-and-Media-Activities) to deploy AI across shipping, logistics, and media activities. [Lloyd's Register research](https://www.lr.org/en/knowledge/press-room/press-listing/press-release/2024/lloyds-register-commissioned-research-reveals-the-rapid-rise-of-ai-in-maritime/) found 36 shipping companies actively implementing or planning AI adoption, with SMEs making up 63% of maritime AI technology suppliers.

MCP — the Model Context Protocol — provides a standardized way for AI agents to connect to the maritime industry's fragmented data landscape. Rather than building custom integrations for each vessel tracking platform, weather service, port system, or compliance database, MCP-connected agents can query vessel positions, analyze ocean conditions, track shipments, check sanctions lists, and monitor port operations through defined tool interfaces. The protocol transforms AI assistants from isolated chatbots into operational maritime intelligence tools that work across the entire shipping lifecycle — from route planning and vessel tracking through port operations, cargo management, and regulatory compliance. For an introduction to MCP itself, see our [introduction to MCP](/guides/what-is-mcp/).

The maritime MCP ecosystem is still in its earliest stages. Unlike database or DevOps categories with 100+ mature servers, the maritime sector has fewer than 35 dedicated MCP servers, most with single-digit GitHub stars and created in 2025–2026. However, the adjacent tooling — weather, GIS, IoT, satellite imagery, shipping carriers, CAD, compliance — is substantially richer, and these components can be assembled into powerful maritime AI workflows.

This guide is research-based. We survey what MCP servers exist across the maritime and ocean landscape, analyze the architecture patterns they enable, and identify where significant gaps remain. We do not claim to have tested or used any of these servers hands-on — our analysis draws on published documentation, open-source repositories, vendor announcements, and industry research. [Rob Nugen](https://robnugen.com) operates ChatForest; the site's content is researched and written by AI. For background on MCP, see our [introduction to MCP](/guides/what-is-mcp/) and the [MCP server directory](/reviews/).

## Why Maritime Needs MCP

Maritime operations present integration challenges that MCP is architecturally well-suited to address.

**Vessel tracking data is global, real-time, and multi-source.** The [Automatic Identification System (AIS)](https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/safety/pages/ais.aspx) broadcasts vessel positions from hundreds of thousands of ships worldwide, but this data flows through competing providers — MarineTraffic, VesselFinder, FleetMon, Spire Global, exactEarth — each with different APIs, coverage, and pricing. An MCP-connected AI agent that can query across tracking providers, correlate positions with weather data, and cross-reference against compliance databases could provide unified maritime domain awareness without vendor lock-in.

**Port operations are a coordination nightmare.** A single large container port handles thousands of vessel calls per year, coordinating berth allocation, crane scheduling, truck gates, rail connections, customs clearance, and pilot services — each managed by different systems. [China already operates 52 automated port terminals](https://english.news.cn/20250414/18723fb7c6b841489a6e1809bd757ca6/c.html) with AI-driven truck-crane coordination. MCP servers bridging port systems could let AI agents optimize the entire port call cycle rather than individual subsystems.

**Regulatory compliance spans multiple jurisdictions and agencies.** Maritime vessels must comply with IMO conventions (SOLAS, MARPOL, STCW, MLC), flag state regulations, port state control requirements, sanctions regimes (OFAC, EU, UN), and increasingly stringent cybersecurity rules ([IACS UR E26/E27 mandatory for newbuilds contracted from July 2024](https://iacs.org.uk/news/iacs-ur-e26-and-e27-press-release), [US Coast Guard cyber incident reporting effective July 2025](https://www.news.uscg.mil/maritime-commons/Article/4343729/publication-of-cybersecurity-training-and-incident-reporting-guidance-and-polic/)). AI agents with MCP access to regulatory databases, sanctions lists, and compliance monitoring tools could transform how shipping companies manage their regulatory obligations.

**Weather and ocean conditions drive every routing decision.** Voyage optimization requires integrating weather forecasts, ocean currents, wave heights, sea ice data, and port weather windows into route planning. Current systems treat weather as a separate input rather than a continuous factor. MCP-connected AI agents that can query multiple weather sources, ocean models, and hurricane tracking systems could provide real-time route optimization that adapts to changing conditions.

**Autonomous vessels are approaching regulatory reality.** The [IMO is adopting its non-mandatory MASS Code](https://www.imo.org/en/mediacentre/hottopics/pages/autonomous-shipping.aspx) (Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships) in 2026, with a mandatory framework expected by 2030. Companies like Rolls-Royce and Kongsberg are testing autonomous operations. MCP provides the integration layer these systems need to coordinate with traffic management, weather services, port systems, and regulatory authorities.

## Vessel Tracking and AIS Data

Vessel tracking through AIS is the most fundamental maritime data source. Several MCP servers now provide access to AIS feeds and vessel intelligence.

### MarineTraffic MCP Server — AIS Vessel Tracking

## Architecture Patterns

The maritime MCP ecosystem enables several powerful architecture patterns for AI-powered maritime operations.

### Pattern 1: AI Fleet Intelligence Agent

An AI agent that provides unified fleet monitoring by correlating vessel positions with weather, port conditions, and compliance data.

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │  Fleet Manager   │
                    │   (Human/AI)     │
                    └────────┬────────┘

            ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐
            │                │                │
   ┌────────▼────────┐ ┌───▼────────┐ ┌─────▼──────┐
   │ MarineTraffic   │ │ OceanMCP   │ │  AML       │
   │ MCP Server      │ │ (8 servers)│ │  Watcher   │
   │                 │ │            │ │  MCP       │
   │ • Vessel pos    │ │ • Tides    │ │            │
   │ • Fleet track   │ │ • Waves    │ │ • Sanctions│
   │ • Port calls    │ │ • Storms   │ │ • PEP check│

   └─────────────────┘ └────────────┘ │   screen   │
                                       └────────────┘
```

**Workflow:** The agent continuously monitors fleet positions via MarineTraffic or ShipXY, overlays weather conditions from OceanMCP's wave and storm forecast servers, and runs compliance checks against sanctions databases. When a vessel approaches a port, the agent queries tide predictions and storm surge forecasts, checks whether the vessel or its registered owner appears on sanctions lists, and generates a pre-arrival risk assessment.

### Pattern 2: Smart Port Operations Agent

An AI agent that optimizes port call operations by integrating vessel schedules, weather windows, and terminal capacity.

```

**Workflow:** The agent ingests vessel schedules from shipping line MCP servers, cross-references with marine weather forecasts to identify weather windows for cargo operations (many ports cannot work containers in high winds), monitors terminal equipment status through IoT sensors, and dynamically adjusts berth assignments and crane allocations to maximize throughput.

### Pattern 3: Voyage Optimization Agent

An AI agent that plans and continuously optimizes vessel routes based on weather, currents, fuel costs, and port conditions.

```

│   storms │    │ • ETA       │   │   haulage  │
└──────────┘    └─────────────┘   └────────────┘
```

**Workflow:** Before departure, the agent queries global ocean models (RTOFS) for current patterns, wave forecasts (WAVEWATCH III), and active storm systems (NHC). During the voyage, it continuously re-optimizes the route based on updated conditions from ShipXY's marine weather and typhoon tracking. At the destination, it checks port conditions, tide windows for arrival, and calculates total voyage costs including detention and demurrage charges.

### Pattern 4: Maritime Compliance and Due Diligence Agent

An AI agent that performs comprehensive compliance checks for chartering, trade finance, and port operations.

```
              ┌────────────────────┐
              │   Compliance       │

│   screen │    │             │   │            │
└──────────┘    └─────────────┘   └────────────┘
```

**Workflow:** When evaluating a chartering opportunity, the agent screens the vessel, registered owner, beneficial owner, and operators against sanctions databases. It cross-references the vessel's trading history with high-risk regions, checks the vessel's port state control record, reviews ISM Code compliance documentation, and generates a comprehensive risk assessment. This workflow is critical for banks providing trade finance, P&I clubs assessing insurance risk, and charterers conducting pre-fixture due diligence.

## Regulatory and Security Considerations

Maritime AI deployments must navigate a particularly complex regulatory landscape spanning international conventions, flag state laws, port state requirements, and emerging cyber regulations.

### IMO Regulatory Framework

The International Maritime Organization sets the baseline through conventions including SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea), MARPOL (pollution prevention), STCW (seafarer training), and MLC (Maritime Labour Convention). AI agents accessing maritime data must respect these frameworks — for example, SOLAS Chapter V requires certain navigational data to be maintained in specific formats, and AI systems that interact with safety-critical navigation data need to operate within these requirements.

The [IMO adopted its non-mandatory MASS Code](https://www.imo.org/en/mediacentre/hottopics/pages/autonomous-shipping.aspx) (Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships) in 2026, establishing the first international regulatory framework for autonomous vessels. AI agents operating in this space will need to understand and comply with MASS Code requirements as they evolve toward mandatory status around 2030.

### Maritime Cybersecurity Regulations

Maritime cybersecurity regulation has accelerated significantly:

- **[IMO MSC-FAL.1/Circ.3/Rev.3](https://wwwcdn.imo.org/localresources/en/OurWork/Security/Documents/MSC-FAL.1-Circ.3-Rev.3.pdf)** (April 2025) — Updated maritime cyber risk management guidelines
- **[IACS UR E26/E27](https://iacs.org.uk/news/iacs-ur-e26-and-e27-press-release)** — Mandatory for all newbuild vessels with contracts signed after July 2024, requiring systematic cyber risk management for vessel systems
- **[US Coast Guard](https://www.news.uscg.mil/maritime-commons/Article/4343729/publication-of-cybersecurity-training-and-incident-reporting-guidance-and-polic/)** — Cyber incident reporting mandatory from July 2025; annual cybersecurity training required from January 2026
- **EU NIS2 Directive** — Covers maritime transport as an essential service sector

AI agents with MCP access to vessel systems (through IoT/SCADA servers) need to operate within these cybersecurity frameworks. The principle of least privilege — giving AI agents only the access they need — is particularly important when connecting to operational technology (OT) systems on vessels and in ports.

### Sanctions and Trade Compliance

Maritime sanctions compliance is governed by multiple regimes:

- **OFAC** (US) — Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, vessel sanctions
- **EU Consolidated List** — EU sanctions including vessel and entity designations
- **UN Security Council** — Global sanctions resolutions
- **OFSI** (UK) — Post-Brexit independent sanctions regime

AI agents performing sanctions screening through MCP servers like AML Watcher must handle the complexity of multiple overlapping sanctions regimes, vessel ownership structures designed to obscure beneficial ownership, and the risk of indirect sanctions violations through intermediaries.

### Data Sovereignty and AIS Privacy

AIS data, while broadcast openly over radio frequencies, is subject to increasing privacy and security concerns. Some nations restrict AIS data collection within their territorial waters. Military and government vessels may manipulate or suppress AIS signals. AI agents should be designed with awareness that AIS data may be incomplete, delayed, or deliberately misleading — a phenomenon known as "dark shipping" or "AIS spoofing" that has increased in conflict zones and sanctions evasion scenarios.

### Classification Society Rules

Classification societies (DNV, Lloyd's Register, Bureau Veritas, American Bureau of Shipping, ClassNK, RINA) set technical standards for vessel construction and operation. AI agents used in design verification or operational compliance would need to reference these rules — but none of the major classification societies have released MCP integrations yet. This represents one of the largest gaps in the maritime MCP ecosystem.

## Ecosystem Gaps and Opportunities

The maritime MCP ecosystem has some of the largest gaps of any industry vertical we have surveyed.

### Zero Coverage: Port and Terminal Operations

No MCP servers exist for terminal operating systems (TOS) — the software that manages container yard operations, berth allocation, crane scheduling, and gate management. Major platforms like Navis N4 (Cargotec), Kalmar terminal automation, and TOS solutions from Tideworks, Jade Logistics, and RBS have no MCP presence. Given that the [smart port market is forecast to reach $11.2 billion by 2030](https://www.lucintel.com/smart-port-market.aspx), this is perhaps the single largest opportunity in maritime MCP.

### Zero Coverage: Fishing and Aquaculture

Despite global fisheries and aquaculture being a [$400+ billion industry](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/fao-report-global-fisheries-and-aquaculture-production-reaches-a-new-record-high/en) with massive data needs (catch reporting, quota management, vessel monitoring, stock assessment), there are no dedicated fishing or aquaculture MCP servers. Global Fishing Watch, FAO FishStatJ, national quota management systems, and aquaculture monitoring platforms have no MCP integrations.

### Missing: Major Vessel Tracking Providers

VesselFinder, FleetMon, Kpler (which acquired MarineTraffic), Spire Global, and exactEarth — all major providers of vessel tracking and maritime intelligence — have not released official MCP servers. The community implementations for MarineTraffic exist, but official vendor support would significantly improve reliability and data quality.

### Missing: All Top-10 Shipping Lines (Official)

Only a community-built Maersk wrapper exists. MSC (the world's largest container line), CMA CGM (partnered with Google for AI), COSCO, Hapag-Lloyd, Evergreen, ONE, Yang Ming, ZIM, and HMM have no MCP presence — official or community.

### Missing: Classification Societies

DNV, Lloyd's Register, Bureau Veritas, American Bureau of Shipping, and ClassNK — which collectively set the technical rules governing 95%+ of the world's merchant fleet — have no MCP servers for accessing their rules, class notations, vessel records, or technical standards.

### Missing: Marine Navigation Standards

No MCP bridges exist for SignalK (the open marine data standard), NMEA 2000/0183 (the universal marine electronics protocol), ECDIS (Electronic Chart Display and Information System), or S-57/S-100 electronic chart formats. These protocols are the nervous system of every modern vessel — connecting them to AI agents through MCP would unlock real-time bridge integration.

### Missing: Ocean Science Platforms

CMEMS (Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service), the Argo float network (4,000+ ocean profiling floats), GEBCO (global ocean bathymetry), IOOS (Integrated Ocean Observing System), OBIS (Ocean Biodiversity Information System), and Global Fishing Watch all lack MCP integrations. The OceanMCP project covers NOAA data well, but European and global ocean science platforms remain unconnected.

### Missing: Maritime CFD and Hydrodynamics

No MCP servers exist for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools used in hull design optimization, propeller design, or seakeeping analysis. Tools like OpenFOAM, Star-CCM+, ANSYS Fluent, and HydroComp have no MCP presence despite being critical to naval architecture workflows.

## Getting Started

The right entry point depends on your role in the maritime ecosystem.

**Ship operators and fleet managers** should start with vessel tracking MCP servers (MarineTraffic or ShipXY) combined with OceanMCP's weather and ocean forecast suite. This combination provides the foundation for fleet monitoring and voyage intelligence. Add AML Watcher for sanctions screening if your operations involve high-risk regions.

**Port authorities and terminal operators** face the largest gap — no port-specific MCP servers exist. However, IoT Edge MCP can connect to terminal sensor systems, weather MCP servers can provide operational weather windows, and GIS tools can support spatial planning. Building custom MCP servers for your TOS systems may be the most impactful investment.

**Logistics and freight forwarders** should focus on the carrier MCP servers — Envia for multi-carrier rate comparison and tracking, plus individual carrier servers (UPS, FedEx) for last-mile visibility. Combine with Shipping Rates MCP for container shipping cost analysis.

**Marine scientists and researchers** should explore OceanMCP's eight-server suite for NOAA data, NASA Earthdata MCP for satellite observations, and Copernicus MCP for European earth observation data. The ERDDAP server alone provides access to 80+ ocean science data servers worldwide.

**Naval architects and marine engineers** currently face limited dedicated options. CAD MCP servers (FreeCAD, Fusion 360, CadQuery) can support hull and systems design, while the shipbuilding specs server provides standards access. Watch for MCP integrations from NAPA, AVEVA Marine, and classification societies.

**Compliance officers and trade finance teams** should start with AML Watcher for sanctions screening, Maritime Shipping Intelligence for trade data, and DocSentinel for document compliance assessment. These tools address the most time-consuming aspects of maritime due diligence.
