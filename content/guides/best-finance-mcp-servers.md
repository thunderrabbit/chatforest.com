Finance MCP servers are where AI agents meet real money. These servers let AI assistants process payments, manage invoices, reconcile books, pull market data, and interact with banking APIs — all through natural language instead of dashboard-hopping or manual API calls.

We've researched 40+ finance and payment MCP servers across the entire fintech landscape. This guide synthesizes all of that into one page: what's worth using, what's not, and where the gaps are.

> **⚠ April 2026 update:** The x402 protocol has been contributed to the Linux Foundation as the [x402 Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/), with founding members including Stripe, Visa, Mastercard, AWS, Google, Microsoft, and Coinbase. Visa launched its Agent Payments Program in Europe with 21 bank partners. Mercury Bank launched an official MCP server. The gap between "experimental" and "production" agentic payments is closing fast.

*Note: Our recommendations are based on documentation review, GitHub analysis, and community feedback — not hands-on testing of every server. Star counts were verified in April 2026.*

## Why finance MCP servers matter

Money touches every business process. Finance MCP servers add three capabilities that transform how teams work:

1. **Natural language payment operations.** Instead of navigating Stripe dashboards or writing API calls, tell your agent: "Refund order #12345" or "Create a payment link for $500 with a 7-day expiration." The agent translates that into the right API calls with proper authentication.
2. **Cross-platform financial visibility.** An agent with access to Stripe, QuickBooks, and Plaid can answer questions like "What's our net revenue this month after refunds?" by combining data from multiple sources — something that normally requires exporting CSVs and spreadsheet work.
3. **Automated financial workflows.** "Find all overdue invoices, send reminders, and flag anything over $10,000 for manual review" becomes a natural language instruction. AI agents can manage billing cycles, reconciliation, and reporting programmatically.

The landscape splits into seven categories: **payment processors** (Stripe and PayPal dominate with official toolkits), **commerce platforms** (Square and Adyen with full API access), **accounting** (Xero and QuickBooks with official MCP support), **market data** (stock and crypto data providers), **banking** (Mercury and Plaid with official MCP servers), **crypto/agentic payments** (Coinbase leading the x402 protocol via the new Linux Foundation-backed x402 Foundation), and **insurance** (Socotra and Fenris as first movers).

## Payment processors

Payment processing is the most mature category in finance MCP. Both Stripe and PayPal have invested heavily in official agent toolkits, with remote hosted MCP servers and multi-framework support.

### The winner: stripe/ai (formerly stripe/agent-toolkit)

**Stars:** 1,434 | **Language:** TypeScript, Python | **Status:** Production

[stripe/ai](https://github.com/stripe/ai) is the gold standard for AI-powered payment processing. Stripe was one of the earliest major fintech companies to embrace MCP, and it shows. *(Note: the repo was renamed from `stripe/agent-toolkit` to `stripe/ai`; npm/PyPI packages still use the `@stripe/agent-toolkit` name.)*

**Why it wins:** Stripe offers both a **remote hosted MCP server** at `mcp.stripe.com` (OAuth authentication, zero local setup) and a local server via `npx @stripe/mcp`. The toolkit supports every major agent framework — OpenAI Agent SDK, LangChain, CrewAI, Vercel AI SDK, plus native SDK support for Anthropic and Google Gemini. Permission control through Restricted API Keys (RAK) lets you scope exactly which API operations agents can perform.

**Key features:** Payment processing, customer management, subscription handling, invoice operations, refunds and disputes, product catalog management. The toolkit integrates with Stripe's broader AI infrastructure including token metering for usage-based pricing.

**The strategic angle:** Stripe's **Agentic Commerce Suite** is now live, with major brands onboarding: URBN (Anthropologie, Free People, Urban Outfitters), Etsy, Ashley Furniture, Coach, Kate Spade, and Revolve. The **Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)** — co-maintained with OpenAI — has 1,319 stars and four releases covering fulfillment, capability negotiation, and extensions/discounts. Stripe also co-authored the **Machine Payments Protocol (MPP)** with Tempo for autonomous agent-to-agent payments. Agent-mediated payments are now a core Stripe product.

**The catch:** The toolkit "is not exhaustive of the entire Stripe API." Complex operations like Connect platform management or advanced reporting may require direct API access. But for the most common payment workflows, it covers the ground.

### Runner-up: paypal/agent-toolkit

**Stars:** 183 | **Language:** TypeScript, Python | **Status:** Production

[paypal/agent-toolkit](https://github.com/paypal/agent-toolkit) — 30+ tools across 7 categories: invoices (7 tools), payments (5), dispute management (3), shipment tracking (3), catalog management (3), subscriptions (7), and reporting/insights (2).

**Why it's strong:** PayPal's toolkit covers the full commerce lifecycle — not just payments, but invoicing, disputes, subscriptions, and shipping. It supports the same major frameworks as Stripe (OpenAI, LangChain, Vercel, MCP). Both sandbox and production environments are supported with configurable tool activation per use case.

**Remote MCP support:** PayPal offers both local MCP servers and cloud-hosted remote servers with authentication integration, following the same pattern as Stripe.

**Best for:** Teams already in the PayPal ecosystem, or those needing dispute management and invoicing alongside payments. The subscription tools (7 dedicated functions) are more granular than what Stripe's MCP toolkit exposes.

## Commerce platforms

Commerce platform MCP servers go beyond payment processing to cover the full business stack — orders, inventory, customers, and catalog management.

### The winner: square/square-mcp-server

**Stars:** 95 | **Language:** TypeScript | **Status:** Beta

[square/square-mcp-server](https://github.com/square/square-mcp-server) — 3 meta-tools that provide access to 40+ Square API services.

**Why it wins:** Square takes a clever architectural approach. Instead of exposing dozens of individual tools (which can overwhelm LLM context windows), it provides three meta-tools: `get_service_info` (discover available API methods), `get_type_info` (retrieve parameter requirements), and `make_api_request` (execute calls). This means the server covers Square's entire API surface — payments, orders, catalog, customers, inventory, loyalty, gift cards, and more — through a discoverable interface.

**Remote MCP:** Square hosts a remote server at `mcp.squareup.com/sse` with OAuth authentication, giving more granular permissions than API key-based local servers.

**The catch:** Beta status means the API surface may change. The meta-tool approach requires more back-and-forth with the LLM compared to dedicated per-operation tools.

### Runner-up: Adyen/adyen-mcp

**Stars:** 20 | **Language:** TypeScript | **Status:** Active

[Adyen/adyen-mcp](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-mcp) — 21 tools across 6 categories covering checkout sessions, payment links, payment modifications, merchant accounts, terminal management (9 tools), and webhook configuration.

**Best for:** Enterprise merchants on Adyen who need terminal fleet management and in-person payment capabilities. The 9 terminal management tools are unique — no other payment MCP server covers physical POS integration this deeply. The webhook management tools (added February 2026) let agents configure and monitor payment notifications programmatically.

## Accounting platforms

Accounting is where finance MCP gets genuinely useful for day-to-day operations. Both major cloud accounting platforms now have official MCP servers.

### The winner: XeroAPI/xero-mcp-server

**Stars:** 230 | **Language:** TypeScript | **Status:** Production

[XeroAPI/xero-mcp-server](https://github.com/XeroAPI/xero-mcp-server) — 48 tools covering accounting operations, payroll management, and financial reporting. Official, maintained by the Xero API team.

**Why it wins:** The broadest tool coverage of any accounting MCP server. 48 commands span contact management, invoice operations, chart of accounts administration, payroll employee and timesheet management, and financial reporting (profit/loss, balance sheets, trial balance). OAuth2 authentication with custom connections and bearer token support gives flexible deployment options.

**The practical value:** An agent with Xero MCP access can handle tasks like "Create an invoice for Client X for 40 hours of consulting at $150/hour, due in 30 days" or "Show me the P&L for Q1 2026" — operations that normally require logging into the Xero dashboard and navigating multiple screens.

**2026 context:** Xero replaced its broad OAuth 2.0 scopes with ten granular scopes for apps created after March 2, 2026. Existing apps have until September 2027 to migrate. This is good for security — agents get only the permissions they need.

### Runner-up: intuit/quickbooks-online-mcp-server

**Stars:** 138 | **Language:** TypeScript | **Status:** Early Preview

[intuit/quickbooks-online-mcp-server](https://github.com/intuit/quickbooks-online-mcp-server) — 11 entities with full CRUD operations: accounts, bills, bill payments, customers, employees, estimates, invoices, items, journal entries, purchases, and vendors.

**Why it matters:** QuickBooks dominates US small business accounting. Having an official Intuit-maintained MCP server is significant. The OAuth flow with automatic browser redirect and token management makes setup straightforward.

**The bigger picture:** In February 2026, Intuit and Anthropic announced a multi-year partnership to bring MCP integrations across TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp directly into Anthropic products (Claude.ai, Cowork, Claude for Enterprise). Businesses will be able to build custom AI agents using Claude Agent SDK on the Intuit platform. The rollout began spring 2026 — QuickBooks MCP is becoming a first-class experience inside Claude.

**The catch:** Still labeled "Early Preview" with no public repo commits since October 2025 — the entity coverage (11 types) is narrower than Xero's 48 tools. The partnership with Anthropic suggests the real QuickBooks MCP experience may live inside Claude rather than as a standalone open-source server.

### Also notable: Lago agent-toolkit

[getlago/lago-agent-toolkit](https://github.com/getlago/lago-agent-toolkit) — 11 stars, Rust, 40+ tools. For teams using Lago's open-source metering and usage-based billing platform, this toolkit provides invoice management, customer queries, metrics, coupons, and payment operations. Niche but well-built — Rust implementation with Docker multi-architecture support.

## Market data

Market data MCP servers are the most popular finance category by GitHub stars. Developers and traders want AI assistants that can pull stock prices, financial statements, and market news on demand.

### The winner: financial-datasets/mcp-server

**Stars:** 1,744 | **Language:** Python | **Status:** Production (stable)

[financial-datasets/mcp-server](https://github.com/financial-datasets/mcp-server) — 10 tools covering financial statements (income, balance sheets, cash flow), stock prices (current and historical), company news, and cryptocurrency data.

**Why it wins:** The most popular finance MCP server by far, with clean architecture and broad data coverage. It covers both traditional equities and crypto in a single interface. The API provides income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements, SEC filings, stock prices, and market news.

**Best for:** Investors, analysts, and developers who need AI-assisted financial research. "Compare Apple's gross margins over the last 5 years" or "What's the latest news on NVIDIA?" become single-turn queries.

**Note:** The repo hasn't been updated since mid-2025, suggesting maturity rather than abandonment — the feature set is stable.

### Runner-up: Alpha Vantage MCP

**Stars:** 114 | **Language:** Python | **Status:** Active

[alphavantage/alpha_vantage_mcp](https://github.com/alphavantage/alpha_vantage_mcp) — Official vendor-hosted remote MCP server also available at [mcp.alphavantage.co](https://mcp.alphavantage.co/). Covers stocks, options, forex, crypto, commodities, technical indicators, and economic data.

**Key advantage:** Both self-hosted (via GitHub) and vendor-hosted (zero local setup) options. Uses "Progressive Tool Discovery" to minimize token consumption — a smart design choice for LLM efficiency. Actively maintained with commits as recent as April 2026.

### Also notable

- **Yahoo Finance MCP** — [Alex2Yang97/yahoo-finance-mcp](https://github.com/Alex2Yang97/yahoo-finance-mcp) (256 stars, actively developed) is the standout community implementation. Free access to stock data, financials, options, and news. Good for personal use; Yahoo's terms of service may limit commercial applications.
- **Massive.com MCP** ([massive-com/mcp_massive](https://github.com/massive-com/mcp_massive)) — 291 stars, v0.8.7 (March 2026). 4 composable tools covering the entire API surface with in-memory DataFrames, SQL queries, and built-in financial functions. Very actively maintained.
- **EODHD MCP** ([EodHistoricalData/EODHD-MCP-Server](https://github.com/EodHistoricalData/EODHD-MCP-Server)) — Major March 2026 update: now 75 tools, 100+ documentation resources, 3 prompt templates. Supports OAuth (v2) and API key (v1). Official from EODHD. Covers stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, and economic data.

## Banking & expense management

Banking MCP servers have matured significantly in early 2026. Multiple banks now offer official MCP access — a major shift from the community-only landscape of late 2025.

### The winner: Mercury MCP (official)

[Mercury MCP](https://docs.mercury.com/docs/supported-tools-on-mercury-mcp) — Official MCP server from Mercury Bank with OAuth 2.0 authentication and read-only access.

**Why it wins:** Mercury is the first major US business banking platform with an official MCP server. Read-only access with time-limited tokens strikes the right balance between utility and security for banking data. Community implementations ([jbdamask/mcp-mercury-banking](https://github.com/jbdamask/mcp-mercury-banking), [dragonkhoi/mercury-mcp](https://github.com/dragonkhoi/mercury-mcp)) extend the official offering.

**Best for:** Startups and tech companies banking with Mercury who want AI-assisted treasury management, transaction analysis, and financial reporting.

### Also notable: Plaid Dashboard MCP (official)

Plaid released its official Dashboard MCP Server at `https://api.dashboard.plaid.com/mcp` — but it's a **developer diagnostics** tool, not a personal finance data server. It helps developers manage their Plaid integrations with 4 tools: `plaid_debug_item`, `plaid_get_link_analytics`, `plaid_get_usages`, and `plaid_list_teams`. OAuth authentication with `mcp:dashboard` scope and 15-minute token expiry.

**Important distinction:** This does NOT give AI agents access to end-user bank accounts. It's for developers debugging and monitoring their Plaid integrations. The personal finance data gap remains — community implementations like [Harshaan-Chugh/FinAgent-MCP](https://github.com/Harshaan-Chugh/FinAgent-MCP) still fill that role.

Plaid secured an $8 billion valuation in February 2026, with IPO speculation ongoing for 2026.

### Also notable

- **Griffin Bank MCP** ([griffinbank/griffin-mcp-server](https://github.com/griffinbank/griffin-mcp-server)) — 13 stars. First UK bank with full **read-write** MCP capabilities (sandbox). PRA/FCA regulated. Account opening, payments, and transaction analysis. Open beta.
- **Slash (US)** — Read + write MCP access, live. Account data, card management, payment initiation. Hosted MCP server with SSE transport; virtual Visa card management.
- **Grasshopper Bank (via Narmi)** — Read-only, beta. First US bank with MCP server implementation. Account data, transaction analysis, cash flow insights.
- **GoCardless MCP** — Official MCP server for bank payment integration (direct debit). Payment implementation guidance, real-time payment data queries, code generation.
- **Brex MCP** ([crazyrabbitLTC/mcp-brex-server](https://github.com/crazyrabbitLTC/mcp-brex-server)) — Expense tracking and corporate card management. Read-only, optimized for safe small responses.
- **Wise MCP** ([sergeiledvanov/mcp-wise](https://github.com/sergeiledvanov/mcp-wise)) — International money transfer via Wise API. Recipient management with sandbox and production support.

## Crypto & agentic payments

Crypto MCP servers are pioneering **agentic payments** — where AI agents don't just query financial data but autonomously send and receive money. The x402 protocol's contribution to the Linux Foundation in April 2026 marks the transition from experiment to industry standard.

### The winner: coinbase/payments-mcp

**Stars:** 51 | **Language:** TypeScript | **Status:** Active

[coinbase/payments-mcp](https://github.com/coinbase/payments-mcp) combines wallets, onramps, and payments via the **x402 protocol** into a single solution for agentic commerce.

**Why it wins:** This is the first tool that lets popular LLMs like Claude, Gemini, and Codex access a wallet, onramp, and payment system — no API key required. Users sign up with just an email. The x402 protocol enables AI agents to autonomously discover and pay for services.

**April 2026 update:** On April 2, 2026, Coinbase contributed the x402 protocol to the Linux Foundation as the **x402 Foundation**. Founding members include Adyen, AWS, American Express, Circle, Cloudflare, Coinbase, Fiserv, Google, KakaoPay, Mastercard, Microsoft, Polygon Labs, PPRO, Shopify, Sierra, Solana Foundation, Stripe, thirdweb, and Visa. The protocol has processed 100M+ payments in approximately 6 months, running on Base and Solana with expansion planned. V2 of the protocol has launched. This is no longer experimental — it's backed by every major payment network.

### Runner-up: base/base-mcp

**Stars:** 342 | **Language:** TypeScript | **Status:** Active

[base/base-mcp](https://github.com/base/base-mcp) — Onchain tools for LLMs with 155 commits and active development. Wallet management, fund transfers, smart contract deployment, and protocol interactions on Base blockchain. Powered by Base Developer Tools + AgentKit. Extensible with custom third-party protocols, tools, and data sources. Base's 2026 strategy is explicitly agent-native: smart accounts, CLI/MCP access, x402 integration.

### Also notable

- **Philidor-Labs/philidor-mcp** — Search 700+ DeFi vaults, compare risk scores across Morpho, Aave, Spark, Yearn, Beefy, Compound, and Uniswap.
- **arcadia-finance/mcp-server** — Uniswap + Aerodrome liquidity management with leverage, rebalancing, and yield optimization on Base/Unichain.
- **tatumio/blockchain-mcp** — 14 stars. 130+ blockchain networks, 59-65 tools across 8 categories. The broadest multi-chain MCP server.
- **coinpaprika/dexpaprika-mcp** — Real-time DEX/DeFi data: pools, tokens, trades, OHLCV charts.

## Insurance

Insurance is a new addition to the finance MCP landscape. Two vendors launched MCP servers in 2025-2026, breaking open a category that was previously listed as a gap.

### Best available: Socotra MCP

[Socotra](https://www.socotra.com/) launched its MCP server in September 2025 — described as "the most mature MCP server in the insurance industry." 10-minute setup instructions for Claude/Cursor. Available to all Socotra customers across all insurance lines. The Socotra Insurance Suite covers policy administration, claims, and billing.

### Also notable

- **Fenris Digital MCP** (March 2026) — Standardized access to enrichment and predictive intelligence for insurance workflows: intake, quoting, underwriting triage, lead routing, and renewal outreach. Supports tens of millions of insurance transactions annually.
- **Policy Penguin MCP** — Developer preview for structured insurance data: coverage details, limits, deductibles, discounts, and renewal history.

→ Fenris Digital for enrichment and predictive intelligence

## Four trends to watch

**1. Agentic payments are production-ready.** The x402 Foundation (Linux Foundation, April 2026) has Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, AWS, Google, and Microsoft as founding members. Visa's Agent Payments Program is live in Europe with 21 bank partners — Banco Santander completed an end-to-end test where an AI agent bought a book using a tokenized Visa credential with no manual consumer input. Mastercard's Agent Suite has completed live agentic payment transactions across Latin America. This is no longer experimental.

**2. Banks are joining the MCP ecosystem.** Mercury, Griffin (UK), Slash, and Grasshopper (via Narmi) all launched official MCP servers. Plaid released its Dashboard MCP for developer diagnostics. GoCardless launched MCP for direct debit. Banking went from "the least mature category" to one showing rapid institutional adoption.

**3. Official toolkits dominate.** Stripe, PayPal, Square, Adyen, Xero, QuickBooks, Coinbase, Mercury, Plaid, and GoCardless all have official MCP servers. The ACP protocol (co-maintained by Stripe and OpenAI) now has major brand deployments. In finance, official support is table stakes — you're dealing with real money.

**4. Multi-protocol convergence.** Stripe's ACP, Coinbase's x402, Google's Agent Payments Protocol, and Visa's Agent Payments Program all launched within months of each other. These aren't competing — they're layering. x402 handles the payment rail, ACP handles the commerce workflow, and Visa/Mastercard provide the institutional trust layer. The question is no longer "will AI agents handle payments?" but "which protocol stack?"

## What's missing

- **Plaid personal finance MCP.** Plaid's official MCP is developer diagnostics only — there's still no official way for AI agents to access end-user bank accounts, transactions, and balances through Plaid. This remains the biggest consumer-facing gap.
- **Tax preparation.** The Intuit-Anthropic partnership (spring 2026 rollout) should bring TurboTax capabilities into Claude, but no standalone tax MCP server exists yet.
- **Payroll beyond Xero.** Xero's MCP covers payroll, but standalone payroll platforms (Gusto, Rippling, ADP) lack official MCP support. A community Rippling MCP server exists (2 stars) but it's not official.
- **Multi-platform reconciliation.** No MCP server connects Stripe + QuickBooks + Plaid to automate end-to-end reconciliation. This is the workflow teams actually want. The closest is Accounting Practice MCP Server (pricepertoken.com) with QuickBooks sync and AI-powered categorization.
- **Ramp.** Despite a $32B valuation and rapid growth, Ramp has no MCP server yet — a notable absence in expense management.
