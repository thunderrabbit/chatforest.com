IoT is where MCP servers get physical. Instead of managing databases or deploying code, these servers control lights, read sensors, manage industrial equipment, and orchestrate smart homes — all through natural language. The category spans everything from a Raspberry Pi temperature sensor to AWS-scale industrial asset monitoring.

We've researched 50+ IoT MCP servers across the full landscape. This guide covers what's production-ready, what's experimental, and where significant gaps remain. **April 2026 update:** Home Assistant shipped native MCP support in core, Matter protocol servers appeared (partially filling the biggest gap), and the industrial IoT category expanded significantly with Siemens S7 and multi-protocol servers.

*Note: Our recommendations are based on documentation review, GitHub analysis, and community feedback — not hands-on testing of every server. Star counts were verified in April 2026.*

## Why IoT MCP servers matter

IoT device management is a pain. Different protocols (MQTT, Zigbee, Z-Wave, Matter), different platforms (Home Assistant, AWS, ThingsBoard), different APIs for every vendor. MCP servers collapse this complexity into conversational commands.

The value comes in three forms:

1. **Smart home control.** "Turn off all the lights downstairs" or "Set the thermostat to 20°C when I'm away" — instead of navigating through apps and dashboards. Home Assistant MCP servers make this natural.
2. **Industrial monitoring.** "Show me the temperature readings from sensor bank 3 over the last 24 hours" or "Are any alarms active on the production floor?" — agents query telemetry data, manage alarms, and monitor equipment without custom dashboards.
3. **Embedded development.** "Build and flash this firmware to the ESP32" or "Create a new PlatformIO project for the Arduino Mega" — MCP servers wrap development toolchains, making hardware projects accessible through AI assistants.

The landscape splits into ten categories: **Home Assistant** (the most mature, 5+ servers), **MQTT** (the protocol layer), **AWS IoT** (industrial-scale), **IoT platforms** (ThingsBoard, Node-RED, Tuya), **ESP32** (development + on-device), **Arduino/robotics** (hardware control), **PlatformIO** (board-agnostic development), **Apple HomeKit** (iOS ecosystem), **industrial IoT** (Modbus, OPC UA), and **smart lighting** (Hue, LIFX).

## Home Assistant servers

Home Assistant is the clear leader in smart home MCP integration — and it just got stronger. With 5+ community servers, a rapidly growing flagship project, **and native MCP support now built into Home Assistant Core**, it's the safest entry point for AI-controlled smart homes.

**Major development (since HA 2025.2):** Home Assistant Core now includes native MCP integrations — both an **MCP Server** (lets external AI clients control your HA instance) and an **MCP Client** (lets HA consume external MCP tools). This is built-in, not a third-party add-on. Currently used by ~1.5% of active installations.

### The winner: homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp

**Stars:** 2,044 | **Language:** Python | **License:** MIT | **Tools:** 92+ | **Latest:** v7.2.0 (April 1, 2026)

[homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp](https://github.com/homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp) is the most comprehensive Home Assistant MCP server by every metric: tool count, client compatibility, and community adoption. It covers search/discovery, device control, automation management, camera snapshots, ZHA (Zigbee Home Automation) devices, backups, add-ons, and dashboards. Supports Claude Desktop, Gemini, ChatGPT, VS Code, and Cursor. Includes OAuth and can be deployed as a Home Assistant OS add-on.

**v7.x highlights (March–April 2026):** v7.0.0 added SSRF/XSS fixes, Nabu Casa webhook proxy, and bundled HA skills as MCP resources. v7.1.0 brought reactive best-practice warnings on write calls, zone CRUD consolidation, and HA 2026.3 color_temp_kelvin migration. v7.2.0 (April 1) added YAML config editing, a tool explorer with taxonomy/auto-docs, add-on API proxy, Python 3.14 support, and search-based tool discovery. Daily commits continue with system logs, repairs, and ZHA radio metrics.

**Why it wins:** 92+ tools and 2,044 stars make it the most battle-tested option. The breadth is unmatched — from turning on a light to managing backups and ZHA devices. Active daily development with three major releases in the last month.

**The catch:** The sheer number of tools (92+) means high token consumption per request. If you only need basic device control, the HA Core native MCP integration may be sufficient.

**Best for:** Anyone who wants full Home Assistant coverage from an AI assistant.

### Runner-up: Coolver/home-assistant-vibecode-agent

**Stars:** 512 | **Language:** Python | **License:** MIT

[Coolver/home-assistant-vibecode-agent](https://github.com/Coolver/home-assistant-vibecode-agent) is a significant new entrant focused on IDE integration for "vibe-coding" Home Assistant automations, dashboards, and themes. Supports Cursor, VS Code, and Claude Code. Rather than just controlling devices, this server helps you *build* your HA configuration through AI-assisted development.

**Why it's notable:** 512 stars makes it the second most popular HA MCP server. The IDE focus is unique — it's about building HA configurations, not just controlling devices at runtime.

**Best for:** Developers who want AI-assisted Home Assistant configuration and automation development.

### Also notable

**[tevonsb/homeassistant-mcp](https://github.com/tevonsb/homeassistant-mcp)** (562 stars, TypeScript, MIT, 4 tool groups) — Structured approach with Control, Addon, Package, and Automation tool categories. SSE transport for real-time updates. Note: dormant since January 2026.

**[voska/hass-mcp](https://github.com/voska/hass-mcp)** (283 stars, Python, MIT, 11 tools + 7 prompts) — Token-efficient design with lean JSON responses. The 7 guided conversation prompts help with common tasks. Note: dormant since August 2025.

**[jango-blockchained/advanced-homeassistant-mcp](https://github.com/jango-blockchained/advanced-homeassistant-mcp)** (49 stars, TypeScript, MIT, 34 tools) — Enterprise-grade security with JWT auth, rate limiting, and IP allowlisting. Unique Aurora sound-to-light synchronization feature. Runs on Bun runtime.

**[ganhammar/hass-mcp-server](https://github.com/ganhammar/hass-mcp-server)** (23 stars, last pushed March 31, 2026) — Custom Component providing an MCP server via HTTP transport directly inside HA. Runs natively as an HA integration.

**[allenporter/mcp-server-home-assistant](https://github.com/allenporter/mcp-server-home-assistant)** (67 stars, Python, Apache 2.0) — Archived. Its WebSocket-based approach contributed to the native Home Assistant Core MCP integration that has now shipped.

---

## MQTT servers

MQTT is the backbone protocol of IoT. These servers let AI agents publish messages to devices and subscribe to sensor data — the lowest-level but most flexible approach to IoT control.

### The winner: ezhuk/mqtt-mcp

**Stars:** 12 | **Language:** Python | **License:** MIT | **Tools:** 2 core + prompts/resources

[ezhuk/mqtt-mcp](https://github.com/ezhuk/mqtt-mcp) is a lightweight MCP server connecting AI agents to any MQTT broker. Two core tools: Receive Message and Publish Message. Supports building automation, industrial control, and smart home use cases. Docker-ready with AuthKit authentication. Actively maintained (v0.3.1, March 2026).

**Why it wins:** Simplicity and active maintenance. MQTT is inherently a publish/subscribe protocol — a 2-tool server that does pub/sub well is exactly right. The March 2026 update shows ongoing development.

**The catch:** Generic by design. You'll need to know your MQTT topic structure and message formats. No device-specific abstractions.

**Best for:** Developers who already have MQTT infrastructure and want to add AI agent access.

### Also notable

**[Benniu/emqx-mcp-server](https://github.com/benniu/emqx-mcp-server)** (23 stars, Python, Apache 2.0, 5 tools) — EMQX broker integration with client management, QoS control, message retention, and real-time SSE subscription. Supports both EMQX Cloud and self-hosted. Best for EMQX users.

**[tspspi/mcpMQTT](https://github.com/tspspi/mcpMQTT)** (1 star, Python, BSD-3-Clause, 4 tools) — Fine-grained topic-level access control with wildcard pattern matching. Supports stdio, HTTP, and Unix Domain Socket transports. Argon2id API key authentication. Best for security-sensitive MQTT deployments.

**[mqtt-ai/mcp-over-mqtt](https://github.com/mqtt-ai/mcp-over-mqtt)** — A different concept: uses MQTT as the transport layer for MCP itself, rather than controlling MQTT devices through MCP. Interesting for distributed agent architectures where MCP clients and servers communicate over MQTT.

## AWS IoT (industrial scale)

### The winner: awslabs/mcp — IoT SiteWise server

**Stars:** 8,684 (monorepo) | **Language:** Python | **License:** Apache 2.0 | **Tools:** 50+ | **Latest:** v11.0.11

[awslabs/mcp (IoT SiteWise)](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/tree/main/src/aws-iot-sitewise-mcp-server) is the official AWS MCP server for industrial IoT asset management. Part of the AWS MCP monorepo (8,684 stars, actively committed daily). Covers asset creation/management, hierarchies, models, properties, data ingestion, historical retrieval with aggregations, bulk export, ML-powered anomaly detection, gateway management, and SQL-like queries. Built-in industrial knowledge with domain validation.

**Why it wins:** It's official AWS, backed by Amazon's engineering team. 50+ tools cover the full IoT SiteWise surface. ML anomaly detection is a standout — most IoT MCP servers just read data, this one actively identifies problems. Now at v11.0.11 with expanded features.

**The catch:** AWS-only. Requires IoT SiteWise setup, which is a significant investment. Overkill for hobbyist or small-scale IoT.

**Best for:** Enterprise teams already on AWS who need AI-assisted industrial IoT management.

**Azure IoT gap:** No dedicated Azure IoT Hub or Digital Twins MCP server exists. Microsoft's [Azure MCP Server](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp) covers broad Azure services (AKS, Container Apps, Cosmos DB, Storage, monitoring) but not IoT-specific tooling. One community read-only server exists (tlaukkanen/azure-iothub-mcp-server, 0 stars).

**Google IoT gap:** No official or substantial Google Home/Nest MCP server exists. Google Cloud MCP servers cover GCP services (BigQuery, Cloud Run, etc.) but not consumer smart home. One minimal auto-generated community server exists (ag2-mcp-servers/google-home, 1 star). This remains the biggest gap given Google's smart home market share.

---

## IoT platform servers

### The winner: thingsboard/thingsboard-mcp

**Stars:** 94 | **Language:** Java 17+ | **License:** Apache 2.0 | **Tools:** 120+

[thingsboard/thingsboard-mcp](https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard-mcp) is the official ThingsBoard MCP server with the highest tool count of any IoT MCP server (120+ across 10 tool groups). Covers device management, asset/customer CRUD, alarm management, time-series telemetry with TTL, OTA package management, entity relationships, and complex data queries. STDIO and SSE transports. Docker support with configurable tool groups.

**Why it wins:** 120+ tools is extraordinary coverage. Official vendor support means it stays in sync with the ThingsBoard platform. The configurable tool groups let you load only what you need — important given the token cost of 120+ tool definitions.

**The catch:** Requires Java 17+. ThingsBoard-specific — not useful without a ThingsBoard instance.

**Best for:** ThingsBoard platform users who want comprehensive AI agent access to their IoT infrastructure.

### Node-RED servers

**[karavaev-evgeniy/node-red-mcp-server](https://github.com/karavaev-evgeniy/node-red-mcp-server)** (31 stars, JavaScript, MIT, 20+ tools) — The most popular Node-RED MCP server. Retrieve/update flows, manage tabs/nodes, search, trigger inject nodes, and visualize flows. Best for Node-RED users managing complex flow-based IoT automations.

**[fx/mcp-node-red](https://github.com/fx/mcp-node-red)** (2 stars, TypeScript, MIT, 17 tools) — Flow CRUD, runtime control, node module management, context store operations, and system diagnostics. Safety-focused with validation before deployment. Best for teams that want deployment guardrails.

### Also notable

**[tuya/tuya-mcp-sdk](https://github.com/tuya/tuya-mcp-sdk)** (16 stars, Python + Go + C#, Apache 2.0) — Official Tuya SDK for MCP integration with Tuya Cloud. Added C# SDK with examples in March 2026. If you use Tuya-based smart devices (many white-label products run on Tuya), this is the way in.

---

## ESP32 servers

### The development winner: horw/esp-mcp

**Stars:** 143 | **Language:** Python | **License:** Not specified | **Tools:** 7+

[horw/esp-mcp](https://github.com/horw/esp-mcp) is the most popular ESP32 MCP server, focused on the ESP-IDF development workflow. Install ESP-IDF, create projects, set targets, build, list serial ports, flash firmware, and run pytest. Multi-target chip support (ESP32, ESP32-C3, ESP32-S3, and more).

**Why it wins:** The most adopted ESP32 MCP server. Covers the full development cycle from project creation to flashing. Multi-chip support means you're not locked to one ESP32 variant.

**The catch:** PoC phase (as of February 2025). Development tool, not a runtime server — it helps you build firmware, not control a running ESP32.

**Best for:** ESP-IDF developers who want AI-assisted firmware development.

### The hardware winner: navado/ESP32MCPServer

**Stars:** 39 | **Language:** C++ | **Tools:** 10+

[navado/ESP32MCPServer](https://github.com/navado/ESP32MCPServer) is a fundamentally different approach: the MCP server runs ON the ESP32 itself. Auto-scans I2C sensors (BME280, MPU6050, ADS1115, SHT31, BH1750, INA219), parses NMEA GPS/marine data, decodes NMEA 2000 CAN bus, and reads OBD-II vehicle diagnostics. Supports 8 hardware platforms including ESP32-S3, ESP32-C3, and nRF52840.

**Why it's notable:** Running MCP directly on embedded hardware is a paradigm shift. Instead of a bridge server on a PC, the microcontroller IS the MCP server. The auto-scanning I2C support means plug-in-and-go for common sensors.

**Best for:** Embedded engineers building sensor networks who want direct AI access to hardware.

### Also notable

**[rzeldent/esp32-cam-ai](https://github.com/rzeldent/esp32-cam-ai)** (23 stars, C++, 4 tools) — ESP32-CAM as an MCP server. Camera capture with flash, OTA updates, watchdog timer, and mDNS discovery. Optimized for <4KB base64 images. Best for vision-enabled IoT projects.

---

## Arduino and robotics servers

### The winner: vishalmysore/choturobo

**Stars:** 78 | **Language:** C++ + TypeScript | **License:** MIT | **Tools:** 13

[vishalmysore/choturobo](https://github.com/vishalmysore/choturobo) bridges Arduino robotics with AI. LED, buzzer, motor, servo, fan, and relay control. Temperature and distance sensing. Supports both wired (Arduino Nano 368) and wireless (ESP32) modes.

**Why it wins:** The only robotics-focused MCP server with meaningful adoption. Direct hardware actuator control through natural language — "turn the motor clockwise" or "read the distance sensor."

**The catch:** Hardware-specific. You need the matching Arduino/sensor setup.

**Best for:** Educational robotics, maker projects, and hardware prototyping.

### Also notable

**[Volt23/mcp-arduino-server](https://github.com/Volt23/mcp-arduino-server)** (10 stars, Python, MIT) — FastMCP bridge to arduino-cli. Sketch management, build/deploy, library operations, serial monitoring. Unique: WireViz schematic generation for AI-powered circuit diagrams.

## Four trends worth watching

**1. Home Assistant has won.** With 2,044 stars on ha-mcp, native MCP support built into HA Core (both server and client integrations), and a new 512-star IDE-focused MCP server, Home Assistant is no longer "pulling ahead" — it's the definitive smart home MCP platform. The HA Core native integration means every HA installation is now a potential MCP server, no third-party add-on required.

**2. Industrial IoT is expanding fast.** What was a sparse category (3 servers, max 22 stars) has grown significantly: Siemens S7 PLC control (s7-mcp-bridge), a 10-protocol collection (IndustriConnect-MCPs covering Modbus, OPC UA, BACnet, PROFINET, EtherCAT, and more), official Litmus Edge support, and Universal Robots arm control. Industrial MCP is moving from experiment to ecosystem.

**3. On-device MCP is real.** Projects like ESP32MCPServer and esp32-cam-ai prove that MCP servers can run directly on microcontrollers. This eliminates the bridge server — the hardware itself speaks MCP. As edge computing grows, expect more embedded MCP servers.

**4. Gaps are closing — slowly.** Matter protocol now has two small MCP servers (7 and 6 stars). SmartThings has community servers (5 stars). Ring has a 3-star server. But Google Home/Nest, Azure IoT Hub, Z-Wave, LoRaWAN, and Thread remain unserved. The practical bridge for all of these is Home Assistant — which, via its native MCP integration, effectively fills these gaps indirectly. Matter itself has reached version 1.5 with cameras, energy management, and 750+ products — see our [Matter Meets MCP deep dive](/guides/mcp-matter-smart-home-protocol/) for the full picture.

## What's missing

The IoT MCP landscape still has notable gaps, though several have narrowed since our last review:

- **Google Home / Nest** — Still no official or substantial MCP server. One minimal auto-generated community server exists (1 star). Given Google's smart home market share, this remains the biggest gap.
- **Azure IoT Hub / Digital Twins** — No dedicated server from Microsoft. Their Azure MCP Server covers broad Azure services but not IoT-specific tooling. One community read-only server exists (0 stars).
- **Matter protocol** *(partially filled)* — Two small MCP servers now exist: [MatterCoder/matter-mcp-server](https://github.com/MatterCoder/matter-mcp-server) (7 stars, uses Open Home Foundation's Python Matter Server) and [0x1abin/matter-controller-mcp](https://github.com/0x1abin/matter-controller-mcp) (6 stars, BLE commissioning, device control). Both are functional but small and not actively maintained. The gap is narrowing but not yet closed. For a deep dive on Matter 1.5, Thread 1.4, bridges, and the emerging AI control stack, see our [Matter Meets MCP guide](/guides/mcp-matter-smart-home-protocol/).
- **Z-Wave** — Only accessible through Home Assistant. No dedicated server.
- **LoRaWAN / Thread / BLE** — No MCP servers for these protocols.
- **SmartThings** *(partially filled)* — [veonua/smartthings-mcp](https://github.com/veonua/smartthings-mcp) (5 stars) and [langowarny/smartthings-mcp](https://github.com/langowarny/smartthings-mcp) (2 stars) exist. No Samsung official server.
- **Ring** *(partially filled)* — [jpcors/ring-mcp](https://github.com/jpcors/ring-mcp) (3 stars) covers doorbells, cameras, lights, and alarm systems.
- **Arlo** — No MCP server found. Gap persists.
- **Wyze** *(partially filled)* — [aldilaff/mcp-wyze-server](https://github.com/aldilaff/mcp-wyze-server) exists (~2 stars) for basic device control.

The practical workaround for most of these gaps is Home Assistant — which, via its native MCP integration, bridges virtually every smart home protocol and platform into a single MCP interface.
