Kubernetes MCP servers let AI assistants manage clusters, debug pods, deploy workloads, and read logs — all through natural language. The ecosystem has matured fast: there are now 70+ Kubernetes-related MCP servers on registries like PulseMCP.

But they take fundamentally different approaches. Some interact directly with the Kubernetes API. Others wrap kubectl commands. Some focus on Docker containers. Others bundle kubectl, Helm, Istio, and ArgoCD into one package.

The architecture matters more than the feature count. A native API server is faster and needs no external binaries. A kubectl wrapper gives you the full CLI surface but adds overhead and dependencies. A read-only server is safer for production. We've researched all the major options to help you choose.

**Disclosure:** Our recommendations are based on research — analyzing documentation, GitHub repositories, community feedback, and published benchmarks. We have not hands-on tested every server in this guide.

## Kubernetes Native API Servers

These servers interact directly with the Kubernetes API server — no kubectl binary needed. They're faster, have lower latency, and don't require external CLI tools on your system.

### containers/kubernetes-mcp-server — The Winner

**Stars:** 1,200 | **Language:** Go | **License:** Apache 2.0

This is the most mature native Kubernetes MCP server. Originally created by Marc Nuri (manusa), it was adopted by the [containers](https://github.com/containers) organization (the same group behind Podman). It talks directly to the Kubernetes API server — no kubectl, no helm, no external dependencies.

**What makes it stand out:**
- **Native API access** — Go client talks directly to the API server. No subprocess overhead, no parsing CLI output
- **Generic resource CRUD** — works with any Kubernetes or OpenShift resource, including CRDs. Not limited to pods and deployments
- **Multi-cluster** — switch between clusters defined in your kubeconfig via a `context` parameter on each tool call
- **OpenShift support** — first-class support for OpenShift-specific resources (Routes, DeploymentConfigs, etc.)
- **OpenTelemetry** — optional distributed tracing and metrics with custom sampling rates
- **Multiple distributions** — single binary (Linux/macOS/Windows), npm package, pip package, Docker image, Helm chart

**Limitations:**
- No built-in safety modes (read-only or non-destructive) — you rely on Kubernetes RBAC for access control
- Fewer convenience prompts compared to kubectl wrappers
- The generic approach means tool names are abstract (`resources_list`, `resources_get`) rather than domain-specific

**Best for:** Teams that want a fast, dependency-free Kubernetes MCP server with direct API access and OpenShift compatibility.

### strowk/mcp-k8s-go — Lightweight Alternative

**Language:** Go | **License:** MIT

A simpler Go-based alternative with a narrower scope. Supports listing contexts, namespaces, nodes, pods, services, and deployments, plus getting events, pod logs, and running commands in pods. Supports `--allowed-contexts` for restricting which clusters are accessible. Multi-arch Docker images available.

**Best for:** Teams that want a minimal, no-frills Go server with explicit context restrictions.

## Kubernetes kubectl Wrapper Servers

These servers wrap the kubectl CLI (and sometimes Helm). They're easier to understand if you think in kubectl commands, but they require kubectl installed and add subprocess overhead.

### Flux159/mcp-server-kubernetes — The Winner

**Stars:** 1,041 | **Language:** TypeScript | **License:** MIT

The most popular TypeScript Kubernetes MCP server. It wraps kubectl but adds thoughtful safety features that the native API servers lack.

**What makes it stand out:**
- **Non-destructive mode** — disable all delete operations (pods, deployments, namespaces) with one flag. Read and create/update still work. This is the safest way to give an AI agent cluster access
- **Secrets masking** — automatically masks sensitive data when retrieving secrets. Other servers return secrets in plain base64
- **Troubleshooting prompts** — guides the AI through systematic Kubernetes debugging flows based on pod keywords and optional namespace
- **Kubeconfig flexibility** — loads from multiple sources in priority order (explicit path, env var, default location)
- **Helm v3 support** — install, upgrade, list, and uninstall Helm releases directly

**Limitations:**
- Requires kubectl (and optionally Helm) installed on the system
- Subprocess overhead — every operation shells out to kubectl
- TypeScript/Node.js runtime required

**Best for:** Teams that want safety features (non-destructive mode, secrets masking) and don't mind the kubectl dependency.

### rohitg00/kubectl-mcp-server — Feature-Rich Alternative

**Stars:** 850 | **Language:** TypeScript | **License:** MIT

The most feature-packed Kubernetes MCP server with 270+ tools, 8 resources, and 8 prompts. Goes beyond cluster management into visualization territory.

**What makes it stand out:**
- **270+ tools** — covers virtually every kubectl operation you could want
- **3D cluster topology** — an interactive Three.js-based visualization of your entire cluster
- **Interactive dashboards** — standalone web UI via the `kubectl-mcp-app` npm package
- **Multiple install options** — npx, npm, pip, Docker, GitHub releases

**Limitations:**
- The sheer number of tools can overwhelm AI assistants — some models struggle with 270+ tool definitions in context
- The visualization features are impressive but orthogonal to MCP's core purpose

**Best for:** Developers who want maximum coverage and like visual cluster exploration.

## Multi-Tool Servers

These bundle multiple Kubernetes ecosystem tools into one MCP server.

### alexei-led/k8s-mcp-server — kubectl + Helm + Istio + ArgoCD

**Language:** Go | **License:** MIT

Unique because it packages four Kubernetes CLI tools in a single Docker container: kubectl, Helm, istioctl, and argocd. Supports AWS EKS, Google GKE, and Azure AKS natively.

**Key features:**
- **Four tools in one** — kubectl, helm, istioctl, argocd all accessible through MCP
- **Cloud provider auth** — native support for EKS, GKE, AKS credential flows
- **Command validation** — validates commands before execution for safety
- **Transport flexibility** — stdio, streamable-http, and SSE (deprecated) transport protocols
- **Containerized** — runs as non-root user in Docker, with strict command validation

**Best for:** Platform engineers running service meshes (Istio) and GitOps (ArgoCD) who want one server for the full stack.

### Azure/mcp-kubernetes — Microsoft's Entry

**Language:** Go | **License:** MIT

Microsoft's Kubernetes MCP server uses a single `call_kubectl` tool that consolidates all kubectl operations, reducing context consumption. Supports configurable access levels (readonly, readwrite, admin) and optional Helm, Cilium, and Hubble tools.

**Key features:**
- **Unified tool** — one `call_kubectl` tool instead of dozens, which some AI models handle better
- **Access levels** — readonly, readwrite, or admin modes built-in
- **Namespace restrictions** — comma-separated list of allowed namespaces
- **Azure ecosystem** — pairs with [Azure/aks-mcp](https://github.com/Azure/aks-mcp) for AKS-specific operations

**Best for:** Azure/AKS shops that want integrated access control without configuring RBAC separately.

## Read-Only & Diagnostic Servers

For production clusters where you want AI to observe but never modify.

### patrickdappollonio/mcp-kubernetes-ro — Purpose-Built Read-Only

**Language:** Go | **License:** MIT

This server is read-only by design, not by configuration. There are no write tools — it's architecturally impossible for it to modify your cluster.

**Capabilities:**
- List any Kubernetes resources (with label and field selectors)
- Get complete resource details
- Retrieve pod logs (with grep patterns, time filtering, previous container logs)
- Discover available API resources and their capabilities
- Base64 encode/decode (useful for reading Kubernetes secrets)
- Per-command context switching for multi-cluster queries
- SSE support for remote/web-based integrations

**Best for:** Production observability, incident response, and environments where AI should never write.

### Other read-only options

- **Flux159** with `--non-destructive` flag: disables deletes but still allows creates and updates
- **containers/kubernetes-mcp-server** with a read-only RBAC service account: native API speed with Kubernetes-enforced access control

## AI Dashboard

### weibaohui/k8m — Kubernetes Dashboard with Built-in MCP

**Stars:** 629 | **Language:** Go (backend) + Baidu AMIS (frontend)

k8m is different from the other entries — it's a full Kubernetes dashboard that happens to include an MCP server with 49 built-in tools. Think Portainer or Lens, but with AI integration.

**Key features:**
- **49 MCP tools** — multi-cluster management through MCP protocol
- **AI-powered diagnostics** — word explanation, YAML attribute translation, describe interpretation, log diagnosis, command recommendations
- **Visual management** — web UI for managing MCP tool permissions
- **Pod file management** — browse, edit, manage files inside pods
- **Helm marketplace** — install and manage Helm applications from the UI
- **Single binary** — one executable, cross-platform, easy deployment

**Limitations:**
- The AI features depend on connecting to an LLM provider
- Chinese-first documentation (English README available but less detailed)
- More "dashboard with MCP" than "MCP server" — different use case

**Best for:** Teams that want a visual Kubernetes dashboard with AI assistance built in.

## Docker Container Management

For managing Docker containers, images, networks, and volumes through AI.

### ckreiling/mcp-server-docker — The Winner

**Stars:** 690 | **Language:** Python | **License:** MIT

The most established Docker MCP server. Manages containers, images, networks, and volumes through a type-safe API with Docker Compose support.

**Key features:**
- Container lifecycle management (create, start, stop, remove)
- Docker Compose stack deployment and management
- Image management (pull, build, list, remove)
- Network and volume operations
- Container log retrieval
- Safety controls for destructive operations

**Best for:** Developers who want to manage Docker containers through AI without kubectl or Kubernetes.

### QuantGeekDev/docker-mcp — Compose-Focused Alternative

**Stars:** 428 | **Language:** TypeScript | **License:** MIT

Focuses on Docker container creation and Compose stack management. Simpler than ckreiling's server but covers the core workflow of creating containers, deploying stacks, and reading logs.

**Best for:** Quick Docker container and Compose management when you don't need the full Docker API surface.

## Docker Infrastructure

### docker/mcp-gateway — MCP Server Orchestration

Docker's official MCP Gateway isn't a Kubernetes server — it's a proxy that orchestrates multiple MCP servers, each running in isolated Docker containers. Every MCP client (VS Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop) connects to one Gateway, which manages configuration, credentials, and server isolation.

**Key features:**
- Container-based server isolation
- Secure secrets management via Docker Desktop
- OAuth integration
- Server catalog management with dynamic tool discovery
- Built-in logging and call tracing
- Open source, included in Docker Desktop

**Best for:** Teams running multiple MCP servers who want unified management and container isolation.

### docker/hub-mcp — Docker Hub Integration

Docker's official MCP server for Docker Hub. Search images, find tags, compare versions, create repositories, manage namespaces. Useful when your AI assistant needs to find the right base image or check for updates.

**Best for:** Image discovery and Docker Hub repository management.

## Container Platform

### portainer/portainer-mcp — Portainer Integration

**Stars:** 116 | **Language:** Go | **License:** MIT

Bridges AI assistants to the Portainer container management platform. Since Portainer manages Docker hosts, Docker Swarm clusters, and Kubernetes clusters, this MCP server gives you access to all of them through one interface.

**Key features:**
- Environment monitoring across Docker and Kubernetes
- Stack deployment (Edge Stacks and local Docker Compose stacks)
- Docker and Kubernetes API proxying through Portainer
- Read-only mode for safe operation
- User and access control management
- Customizable tool definitions via YAML

**Limitations:**
- Requires a running Portainer instance
- Still "work in progress" — feature set is growing
- Proxied access adds latency compared to direct API servers

**Best for:** Teams already using Portainer who want to add AI management without changing their infrastructure.

## Helm Package Management

### zekker6/mcp-helm — Helm Repository Tools

**Stars:** 12 | **Language:** Go | **License:** MIT

A focused MCP server for Helm chart discovery and inspection. Lists charts in repositories, retrieves chart values, and supports authentication for both OCI registries and HTTP repositories.

**Tools:**
- `list_repository_charts` — list all charts in a Helm repository
- `get_latest_version_of_chart` — find the latest version of a specific chart
- `get_chart_values` — retrieve values.yaml for a chart (latest or specific version)

**Note:** This server is for Helm repository operations only — not for installing or managing releases. For Helm release management, use Flux159/mcp-server-kubernetes (which includes Helm v3 support) or alexei-led/k8s-mcp-server (which bundles the Helm CLI).

**Best for:** Teams that need AI assistance browsing Helm charts and comparing configurations.

## Three Trends Shaping This Space

### 1. Native API servers are winning over kubectl wrappers

The containers/kubernetes-mcp-server (native Go, direct API) surpassed Flux159 (kubectl wrapper) in stars despite launching later. The pattern is clear: shelling out to kubectl adds latency, parsing overhead, and a binary dependency. As the MCP ecosystem matures, expect more servers to talk directly to the Kubernetes API.

### 2. Safety modes are becoming table stakes

Every serious Kubernetes MCP server now offers some form of access restriction — read-only mode, non-destructive mode, namespace restrictions, or configurable access levels. The community learned early that giving an AI agent unrestricted cluster access is dangerous. The question isn't whether to restrict access, but how: built-in flags (Flux159), architectural guarantees (patrickdappollonio), or Kubernetes RBAC (containers/).

### 3. Multi-tool bundling for platform engineers

The Kubernetes ecosystem isn't just kubectl. Platform engineers need Helm, Istio, ArgoCD, Cilium, and cloud provider CLIs. Servers like alexei-led and Azure/mcp-kubernetes are responding by bundling multiple tools into single containers. This reduces the number of MCP servers to configure and keeps related tools co-located.

## What's Missing

- **No official Kubernetes MCP server** — unlike AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, the Kubernetes project itself hasn't shipped an MCP server. The containers/ organization server is the closest to "official" but isn't part of the CNCF
- **No Rancher/SUSE integration** — Rancher is widely used for multi-cluster management but has no MCP server
- **No service mesh beyond Istio** — Linkerd and Consul have no dedicated MCP servers
- **No GitOps beyond ArgoCD** — Flux CD lacks MCP integration
- **No cost optimization** — no MCP server for Kubernetes cost analysis (Kubecost, OpenCost)
- **No backup/disaster recovery** — Velero, Kasten, and other backup tools have no MCP presence
- **Thin Helm coverage** — the dedicated Helm server (zekker6) is repository-only with 12 stars; full Helm lifecycle management is only available as a feature within larger servers
