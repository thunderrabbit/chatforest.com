Most MCP interactions flow in one direction: the client calls the server. Sampling flips that. It lets an MCP server ask the client to generate an LLM completion — a text response from whatever model the client is connected to — and return the result. This enables sophisticated agentic behaviors where servers can reason, summarize, and make decisions without needing their own API keys or model access.

This guide explains how sampling works, when to use it, and what security considerations matter. Our analysis is based on the [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/client/sampling) and published implementations — we haven't built production sampling systems ourselves.

## Why Sampling Exists

Without sampling, MCP servers are pure tools — they receive requests, do some work, and return structured data. The intelligence lives entirely in the client. That's fine for simple operations like "read this file" or "query this database," but it limits what servers can do on their own.

Consider a code review server. Without sampling, it can parse code and return syntax information, but the client has to do all the reasoning about code quality. With sampling, the server can ask the client's LLM: "Here's a diff — summarize the key changes and flag potential issues." The server becomes an intelligent agent, not just a data pipe.

Common use cases for sampling include:

- **Multi-step agentic workflows** — a server completes one step, asks the LLM to reason about results, then decides the next step
- **Content generation** — a server gathers data, then asks the LLM to synthesize it into a summary, report, or draft
- **Decision making** — a server presents options to the LLM and uses the response to choose a path forward
- **Translation and transformation** — a server asks the LLM to convert data between formats or languages

## How the Flow Works

Sampling uses a request-response pattern initiated by the server but controlled by the client. Here's the full flow:

### 1. Server Sends a createMessage Request

The server sends a `sampling/createMessage` request to the client. This includes the prompt (as a list of messages), a maximum token count, and optional parameters:

```json
{
  "method": "sampling/createMessage",
  "params": {
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Summarize the key security findings from this scan report: ..."
        }
      }
    ],
    "maxTokens": 1024,
    "systemPrompt": "You are a security analyst. Be concise and specific.",
    "temperature": 0.3
  }
}
```

### 2. Client Reviews the Request

This is the critical security step. The client receives the request and **may modify it** before sending it to the LLM. The client can:

- Inspect the prompt for prompt injection attempts
- Add or remove context
- Change the model, temperature, or token limit
- Show the request to the user for approval (human-in-the-loop)
- Reject the request entirely

The client is always in control. The server cannot bypass this review step.

### 3. Client Samples from the LLM

The client sends the (possibly modified) request to whatever LLM it's connected to. The server has no direct access to the model — it only sees the final result.

### 4. Client Reviews the Completion

Before returning the result, the client can review, filter, or modify the LLM's response. This is another guardrail — the client can redact sensitive information or block responses that violate policies.

### 5. Server Receives the Result

The server gets back a `CreateMessageResult` with the model's response:

```json
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": {
    "type": "text",
    "text": "The scan identified three critical findings: ..."
  },
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
  "stopReason": "endTurn"
}
```

The `model` field tells the server which model actually generated the response (which may differ from what was requested), and `stopReason` indicates why generation stopped.

## Request Parameters

The `createMessage` request supports several parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `messages` | Yes | Array of message objects with `role` and `content` |
| `maxTokens` | Yes | Maximum tokens to generate (client may generate fewer) |
| `systemPrompt` | No | System-level instructions for the LLM |
| `temperature` | No | Controls randomness (0.0 = deterministic, 1.0 = creative) |
| `stopSequences` | No | Strings that stop generation when encountered |
| `modelPreferences` | No | Hints about desired model capabilities |
| `includeContext` | No | Whether to include context from MCP servers |
| `metadata` | No | Additional metadata for the request |

### Model Preferences

Servers can express preferences about model capabilities without specifying exact model names. This uses a priority-based system:

```json
{
  "modelPreferences": {
    "hints": [
      { "name": "claude-sonnet-4-6" }
    ],
    "costPriority": 0.3,
    "speedPriority": 0.8,
    "intelligencePriority": 0.5
  }
}
```

Priority values range from 0 to 1. The client uses these as guidance — it's free to choose any model. This keeps servers model-agnostic while letting them express what matters for the task.

### Include Context (Soft-Deprecated)

The `includeContext` parameter can be set to `"none"` (default), `"thisServer"`, or `"allServers"` to request that the client attach context from MCP servers to the prompt. However, `"thisServer"` and `"allServers"` are **soft-deprecated** in the current spec. Servers should only use these values if the client declares `ClientCapabilities.sampling.context`. These values may be removed in future spec releases.

## Tool Calling in Sampling

The [November 2025 spec update](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-11-25-first-mcp-anniversary/) added support for tool calling within sampling requests. This was a significant gap — without it, sampling was limited to text-in, text-out interactions.

With tool calling, servers can now:

- **Include tool definitions** in sampling requests, so the LLM can call tools as part of its response
- **Specify tool choice behavior** — auto, required, or none
- **Support parallel tool calls** for concurrent execution
- **Implement server-side agent loops** where the server orchestrates multi-step reasoning with tool use

This turns sampling from a simple completion API into a full agentic capability. A server can send a sampling request with tools, get back a tool call, execute it, send the results back in another sampling request, and continue until the task is complete — all without the client needing to orchestrate the loop.

## Security Model

Sampling's security model is built on a key principle: **the client always controls model access**. The server never directly touches the LLM. This has several important implications:

### Human-in-the-Loop

The spec recommends that clients implement human-in-the-loop controls for sampling. In practice, this means:

- Clients **should** show sampling requests to users before forwarding them
- Users **should** be able to approve, modify, or reject requests
- Clients **should** provide UI for reviewing both requests and responses

Not all clients implement this yet, but it's the intended design. The more autonomous the system, the more important these controls become.

### No Server API Keys Needed

Because the client handles model access, servers don't need their own LLM API keys. This is a deliberate design choice — it prevents servers from making arbitrary model calls and keeps the client as the billing and access control point.

### Prompt Injection Risks

Sampling opens a new attack surface. Research from [Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/model-context-protocol-attack-vectors/) has identified prompt injection vectors specific to MCP sampling:

- **Malicious servers** can craft sampling requests that try to manipulate the LLM into calling other tools or leaking context from other servers
- **Data poisoning** — if a server feeds tainted data into a sampling request, the LLM may act on it
- **Context manipulation** — the `includeContext` parameter (when supported) could expose data from other connected servers to a malicious one

Mitigations include:

- Clients reviewing all sampling requests before forwarding
- Limiting what context is shared across servers
- Rate-limiting sampling requests per server
- Implementing content filtering on both requests and responses

### Capability Negotiation

Sampling is an optional capability. Clients declare support during initialization:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "sampling": {}
  }
}
```

If the client doesn't declare sampling support, the server knows not to attempt `createMessage` requests. This prevents errors and lets servers adapt their behavior based on available capabilities.

## Client Support Status

As of early 2026, sampling support varies across MCP clients:

- **Claude Desktop** — does not yet support sampling
- **Claude Code** — does not yet support sampling
- **Some open-source clients** — partial support (often without human-in-the-loop UI)
- **Custom SDK implementations** — full support is available in the official TypeScript and Python SDKs

This is still an emerging feature. If you're building an MCP server that depends on sampling, check your target clients' capability declarations and have a fallback plan for clients that don't support it.

## When to Use Sampling (and When Not To)

**Use sampling when:**
- Your server needs to reason about data it has gathered
- You're building multi-step workflows where each step informs the next
- You want servers to generate human-readable output (summaries, reports, explanations)
- The task requires judgment calls that benefit from LLM reasoning

**Avoid sampling when:**
- The client can handle the reasoning directly (simpler, fewer round-trips)
- You need deterministic, reproducible results (LLM outputs are inherently variable)
- The server already has all the logic it needs without AI assistance
- Your target clients don't support sampling yet

## What's Next for Sampling

The [2026 MCP roadmap](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-mcp-roadmap/) signals continued investment in agentic capabilities. The Tasks primitive (shipping as an experimental feature) and agent communication patterns will likely interact with sampling in new ways — imagine a server that spawns a long-running task, uses sampling to reason about intermediate results, and reports back when done.

As more clients implement sampling with proper human-in-the-loop controls, this feature will become central to how MCP servers operate. The key shift is from servers as passive tools to servers as active agents — capable of reasoning, deciding, and acting, all within the safety boundaries the client sets.
