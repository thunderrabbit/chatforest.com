card_description: "On March 5, 2026, OpenAI released GPT-5.4 — the first general-purpose AI model with native computer-use capabilities that surpass human performance. It scores 75.0% on OSWorld-Verified, beating the human baseline of 72.4%, while offering a 1M-token context window and a new tool search feature that cuts agent costs nearly in half. Three model variants ship: the base model for general tasks, GPT-5.4 Thinking for extended chain-of-thought reasoning, and GPT-5.4 Pro for parallel reasoning threads. Integrated into Codex, it enables end-to-end autonomous coding workflows. But the model fabricates answers 89% of the time when it does not know something, and its computer-use capabilities raise fundamental questions about autonomous agent safety. Here is what GPT-5.4 actually delivers, what it costs, how it compares to Claude Opus 4.6 and Gemini 3.1 Pro, and where the limitations are."

On [March 5, 2026](https://techcrunch.com/2026/03/05/openai-launches-gpt-5-4-with-pro-and-thinking-versions/), OpenAI released [GPT-5.4](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-4/) — the first general-purpose AI model with native computer-use capabilities that [surpass human performance](https://aihaven.com/news/openai-gpt-5-4-launch-computer-agents/) on desktop tasks. The model [scores 75.0% on OSWorld-Verified](https://www.roborhythms.com/gpt-5-4-release-march-2026/), beating the [72.4% human baseline](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/gpt-5-4). It ships with a [1M-token context window](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.4). And it introduces [tool search](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-4/), a feature that [cuts agent token costs nearly in half](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.4).

This is not a marginal upgrade. GPT-5.2 [scored 47.3%](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/gpt-5-4) on the same benchmark. The jump to 75.0% in a single generation represents the kind of capability leap that changes what autonomous agents can actually do.

This analysis draws on reporting from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-4/), [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2026/03/05/openai-launches-gpt-5-4-with-pro-and-thinking-versions/), [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/gpt-5-4), [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/openai-in-desperate-need-of-a-win-launches-gpt-5-4-2000730268), [The Verge](https://www.facebook.com/verge/posts/openais-new-gpt-54-model-is-a-big-step-toward-autonomous-agents/1307842721205198/), and [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/openais-gpt-5-4-pro-and-gpt-5-4-thinking-challenge-googles-gemini-3-1-pro-preview-as-best-all-around-ai-model/) — we research and analyze rather than testing products hands-on.

## Computer Use: The Headline Feature

GPT-5.4's [computer-use capability](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-4/) operates through a perception-action loop. The model [receives a screenshot](https://www.creativeainews.com/blog/gpt-5-4-computer-use-launch/) of the current screen state, reasons about what action to take, and issues structured commands — mouse clicks at specific coordinates, keyboard inputs, scroll actions, or application switches. After the actions execute, a new screenshot is sent back so the model can observe results and decide what to do next.

This means GPT-5.4 can [operate applications that have no API](https://www.nxcode.io/resources/news/gpt-5-4-release-date-features-pricing-2026), navigate unfamiliar interfaces, and recover from unexpected states like pop-up dialogs or error messages. The model [writes code to operate computers via libraries like Playwright](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/latest-model), and it can also issue direct mouse and keyboard commands in response to screenshots.

### OSWorld-Verified: First Model to Beat Humans

The benchmark that matters here is [OSWorld-Verified](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-4/), which measures a model's ability to navigate a desktop environment through screenshots and keyboard/mouse actions. GPT-5.4 [scores 75.0%](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/gpt-5-4), surpassing the [human performance baseline of 72.4%](https://aihaven.com/news/openai-gpt-5-4-launch-computer-agents/).

For context, GPT-5.2 [scored 47.3%](https://www.roborhythms.com/gpt-5-4-release-march-2026/). That is a 27.7-percentage-point improvement in a single model generation — roughly a [59% relative improvement](https://www.nxcode.io/resources/news/gpt-5-4-release-date-features-pricing-2026).

**Note:** H Company's Holo3, released March 31, 2026, subsequently [set a new state of the art at 78.85%](https://www.buildfastwithai.com/blogs/best-ai-models-april-2026) on OSWorld-Verified with a specialized 10B-active-parameter model. See our [Holo3 analysis](/guides/holo3-desktop-agent-osworld-record/) for how an open model overtook GPT-5.4 within weeks.

## The 1M-Token Context Window

GPT-5.4 supports up to [1,050,000 input tokens](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.4) with a [maximum output of 128,000 tokens](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.4). This is not just a bigger context for chatting — it enables agents to [plan, execute, and verify tasks](https://www.nxcode.io/resources/news/gpt-5-4-complete-guide-features-pricing-models-2026) across long horizons without losing track of what they are doing.

For practical agent workflows, this means a GPT-5.4-powered agent can [hold an entire codebase, a full document set, or a long multi-step task plan](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/gpt-5-4) in context simultaneously. Previous models forced agents to work in shorter bursts, constantly re-reading and re-orienting.

There is a [cost consideration](https://help.apiyi.com/en/gpt-5-4-1m-context-272k-pricing-threshold-performance-guide-en.html): once you cross the [272K token mark](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing), the input token rate [doubles from $2.50 to $5.00](https://community.openai.com/t/gpt-5-4-deep-dive-pricing-context-limits-and-tool-search-explained/1375800) per million tokens.

## Tool Search: Cutting Agent Costs

GPT-5.4 introduces [tool search](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-4/), a new API feature that addresses a real pain point for complex agent deployments. Instead of loading all available tool schemas into the prompt upfront — which consumes tokens and adds cost — the model [receives a lightweight tool list and looks up full definitions on demand](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.4).

In an [evaluation of 250 tasks from Scale's MCP Atlas benchmark](https://community.openai.com/t/gpt-5-4-deep-dive-pricing-context-limits-and-tool-search-explained/1375800) with all 36 MCP servers enabled, the tool-search configuration [reduced total token usage by 47%](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.4) while achieving the same accuracy. For teams building agents with dozens or hundreds of available tools, this is a meaningful cost reduction.

## Three Model Variants

GPT-5.4 ships in [three variants](https://techcrunch.com/2026/03/05/openai-launches-gpt-5-4-with-pro-and-thinking-versions/):

| Variant | Purpose | [Pricing](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing) (per 1M tokens) |
|---------|---------|------------------------|
| **GPT-5.4** | General tasks, computer use | [$2.50 input / $15 output](https://openrouter.ai/openai/gpt-5.4) |
| **GPT-5.4 Thinking** | Extended chain-of-thought reasoning | [Similar to base](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing) |
| **GPT-5.4 Pro** | Parallel reasoning threads, highest performance | [$30 input / $180 output](https://www.glbgpt.com/hub/gpt-5-4-pricing/) |

The base model handles most use cases. The [Thinking variant](https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-4-thinking-system-card/) adds structured reasoning for complex problems. The Pro variant is 12x the input cost of the base model — [justified only for tasks](https://www.nxcode.io/resources/news/gpt-5-4-complete-guide-features-pricing-models-2026) where the additional reasoning depth meaningfully improves outcomes.

## Codex Integration: End-to-End Autonomous Coding

With GPT-5.4 as its engine, OpenAI's [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/models) can now handle programming tasks end-to-end with [substantially more autonomy](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/gpt-54-is-a-big-step-for-codex). A developer can describe an entire feature in plain language — "build an authentication system with two-factor verification" — and Codex will [generate the code, create tests, identify potential security flaws, and suggest performance improvements](https://metodoviral.com/en/news/openais-gpt-5-4-brings-autonomous-agents-closer-with-codex/) within a continuous flow.

GPT-5.4 is the [first mainline reasoning model that incorporates the coding capabilities of GPT-5.3-Codex](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-4/) while adding computer-use and tool management features. This positions Codex not just as a code-completion tool but as a [full autonomous coding agent](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex/). For comparison, see our [AI coding assistants comparison](/guides/ai-coding-assistants-compared/) for how Codex stacks up against Claude Code, Cursor, and other tools.

## Competitive Positioning: GPT-5.4 vs. Claude Opus 4.6 vs. Gemini 3.1 Pro

No single model wins across all tasks in March 2026. The frontier model landscape has [fragmented by specialization](https://www.digitalapplied.com/blog/gpt-5-4-vs-opus-4-6-vs-gemini-3-1-pro-best-frontier-model):

**Overall intelligence:** GPT-5.4 and Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview [tie at 57.17-57.18](https://officechai.com/ai/gpt-5-4-tied-with-gemini-3-1-pro-on-artificial-analysis-intelligence-index-first-time-a-new-openai-model-hasnt-topped-index-outright/) on the [Intelligence Index](https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/artificial-analysis-intelligence-index) — [statistically indistinguishable](https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/gpt-5-4).

**Coding:** GPT-5.4 leads. It integrates the [GPT-5.3-Codex capabilities](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex/) and adds tool management features that [improve agent-based development workflows](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-4/).

**Reasoning and science:** Gemini 3.1 Pro leads on [GPQA Diamond (94.3% vs. GPT-5.4's 92.8%)](https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/gpqa-diamond) and [ARC-AGI-2 (77.1% vs. 73.3%)](https://www.buildfastwithai.com/blogs/gpt-5-4-vs-gemini-3-1-pro-2026).

**Nuanced reasoning and writing:** Claude Opus 4.6 [outperforms on tasks requiring careful reasoning and writing quality](https://www.mindstudio.ai/blog/gpt-54-vs-claude-opus-46-vs-gemini-31-pro-benchmarks).

**Computer use:** GPT-5.4 [scored 75.0% on OSWorld-Verified](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-4/) at launch, making it the [first general-purpose model to exceed human performance](https://aihaven.com/news/openai-gpt-5-4-launch-computer-agents/) — though specialized models have since surpassed it.

**Knowledge work:** GPT-5.4 scores [83% on GDPval](https://openai.com/index/gdpval/), [matching industry professionals across 44 occupations](https://thenextweb.com/news/openai-gpt-54-launch-computer-use-benchmarks).

**Multimodal:** Gemini 3.1 Pro is the [only model with native multimodal input](https://www.buildfastwithai.com/blogs/gpt-5-4-vs-gemini-3-1-pro-2026) supporting text, image, audio, and video. Claude and GPT support image input but not audio or video natively at the API level.

**Cost efficiency:** [Gemini wins on reasoning-to-cost ratio](https://www.digitalapplied.com/blog/gpt-5-4-vs-opus-4-6-vs-gemini-3-1-pro-best-frontier-model). GPT-5.4's base pricing at [$2.50/$15 per million tokens](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing) is competitive, but the Pro variant at [$30/$180](https://www.glbgpt.com/hub/gpt-5-4-pricing/) is expensive for high-volume use.

The practical implication: the best engineering teams are [adopting multi-model strategies](https://www.mindstudio.ai/blog/gpt-5-4-vs-claude-opus-4-6-comparison), routing tasks to the model best suited for each workflow.

## What GPT-5.4 Gets Wrong

### The 89% Fabrication Rate

When GPT-5.4 does not know the answer to a question, it [fabricates a response 89% of the time](https://www.ability.ai/blog/gpt-5-4-operational-risks) instead of admitting ignorance. For a model marketed for autonomous workflows, this is a [serious operational risk](https://www.ability.ai/blog/gpt-5-4-operational-risks). An agent that [confidently produces wrong answers](https://www.openaitoolshub.org/en/blog/gpt-5-4-review) is worse than one that stops and asks for help.

### Autonomous Agent Safety

OpenAI classifies GPT-5.4 as ["High cyber capability"](https://deploymentsafety.openai.com/gpt-5-4-thinking) under its [Preparedness Framework](https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-4-thinking-system-card/) and deploys it with an [expanded cyber safety stack](https://deploymentsafety.openai.com/gpt-5-4-thinking), monitoring systems, trusted access controls, and [asynchronous blocking for higher-risk requests](https://deploymentsafety.openai.com/gpt-5-4-thinking/cybersecurity).

The [system card](https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-4-thinking-system-card/) notes there is "no evidence that GPT-5.4 Thinking demonstrates propensities for misalignment" and the model does not possess the "long-range autonomy capabilities" that self-exfiltration or sabotage would require. But this is measured against current capabilities. As these models improve at long-range planning, the safety margins narrow.

### Refusal Enablement Gaps

A pattern [identified in earlier GPT-5.x models](https://repello.ai/blog/security-robustness-in-agentic-ai-a-comparative-study-of-gpt-5.1-gpt-5.2-and-claude-opus-4.5) persists: the model sometimes refuses a request in natural language while still [leaking data, staging artifacts, or providing executable attack steps](https://repello.ai/blog/security-robustness-in-agentic-ai-a-comparative-study-of-gpt-5.1-gpt-5.2-and-claude-opus-4.5). The refusal is cosmetic, not functional. This is a [known issue in the model family](https://novaknown.com/2026/03/07/gpt-5-4-vulnerabilities/).

### Agent Brittleness

LLM agents built on GPT-5.4 can [demonstrate brittle generalization](https://forgecode.dev/blog/gpt-5-4-agent-improvements/) when faced with repeated, long-horizon, or slightly varied tasks. Agents may succeed on a task demonstration but [fail on minor variations](https://www.ability.ai/blog/gpt-5-4-operational-risks) — a challenge for production deployments where edge cases are the norm.

## What This Means for Agentic AI

GPT-5.4 represents a concrete milestone: the [first general-purpose model where computer-use capabilities exceed human baseline performance](https://aihaven.com/news/openai-gpt-5-4-launch-computer-agents/). Combined with the [1M-token context window](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.4) and [tool search](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-4/), it makes certain categories of autonomous agent workflows practical for the first time.

But "practical" and "reliable" are different things. The [89% fabrication rate](https://www.ability.ai/blog/gpt-5-4-operational-risks), [agent brittleness](https://forgecode.dev/blog/gpt-5-4-agent-improvements/) on varied tasks, and [refusal enablement gaps](https://repello.ai/blog/security-robustness-in-agentic-ai-a-comparative-study-of-gpt-5.1-gpt-5.2-and-claude-opus-4.5) mean that GPT-5.4-powered agents require human oversight, particularly in high-stakes workflows. The computer-use capability removes a bottleneck — models can now [interact with software that has no API](https://www.nxcode.io/resources/news/gpt-5-4-release-date-features-pricing-2026) — but it does not remove the need for verification.

The competitive landscape is also moving fast. Within four weeks of GPT-5.4's launch, [H Company's Holo3 surpassed it on OSWorld-Verified](https://www.buildfastwithai.com/blogs/best-ai-models-april-2026) with a specialized open-source model at a fraction of the parameter count and cost. The computer-use frontier is not static.

For developers and organizations evaluating agent infrastructure, GPT-5.4 [expands what is possible](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/gpt-5-4). Whether it is ready for [unsupervised deployment](https://www.ability.ai/blog/gpt-5-4-operational-risks) depends entirely on the cost of errors in your specific use case.
