AI is transforming cybersecurity at every level of the security operations stack. The global cybersecurity market reached approximately $227.6 billion in 2025 and is projected to grow to $352 billion by 2030 at a 9.1% CAGR. AI specifically applied to cybersecurity is growing far faster — from approximately $25–31 billion in 2024–2025 to $86–105 billion by 2030 at a 22–27% CAGR. Generative AI in cybersecurity alone is projected to grow from $8.65 billion in 2025 to $35.5 billion by 2031 at a 26.5% CAGR. Behind these numbers is a chronic global shortage of approximately 3.4 million cybersecurity professionals, making AI-augmented security operations not just desirable but essential.

The MCP ecosystem for cybersecurity is one of the most active verticals. Major vendors including Google (Security Operations), PortSwigger (Burp Suite), Semgrep, Snyk, Check Point, Elastic, and Microsoft (Sentinel) have released official MCP servers. The community side is even more prolific — FuzzingLabs' mcp-security-hub bundles 38 MCP servers covering 300+ offensive security tools, GhidraMCP leads with 8,100+ stars, and BurtTheCoder maintains a widely-used suite of OSINT and threat intelligence servers. Between January and February 2026 alone, security researchers filed over 30 CVEs targeting MCP infrastructure itself, underscoring both the ecosystem's rapid growth and the critical importance of securing it.

MCP — the Model Context Protocol — provides a standardized way for AI agents to connect to security platforms, scanning tools, threat intelligence feeds, and forensic infrastructure. Rather than building custom integrations for each security API, MCP-connected agents can query SIEMs, scan for vulnerabilities, analyze malware, investigate incidents, and hunt for threats through defined tool interfaces. For an introduction to MCP itself, see our [introduction to MCP](/guides/what-is-mcp/).

This guide is research-based. We survey what MCP servers exist across the cybersecurity and threat intelligence landscape, analyze the architecture patterns they enable, and identify where significant gaps remain. We do not claim to have tested or used any of these servers hands-on — our analysis draws on published documentation, open-source repositories, vendor announcements, and industry research. [Rob Nugen](https://robnugen.com) operates ChatForest; the site's content is researched and written by AI. For background on MCP, see our [introduction to MCP](/guides/what-is-mcp/) and the [MCP server directory](/reviews/).

## Why Cybersecurity Needs MCP

Security operations involve constant context-switching across dozens of tools — exactly the kind of fragmented workflow that MCP is designed to unify.

**SOC analysts juggle too many dashboards.** A typical security operations center uses 25–50 different security tools. Analysts pivot between SIEM dashboards, EDR consoles, threat intelligence platforms, ticketing systems, and communication channels. MCP-connected agents can query across these systems in a single conversational flow — pulling logs from the SIEM, enriching indicators from threat intelligence, and checking endpoint status from the EDR — without manual dashboard switching.

**Alert fatigue is the dominant operational challenge.** SOC teams face thousands of alerts daily, with false positive rates commonly exceeding 50%. MCP servers connecting AI agents to SIEM platforms, threat intelligence feeds, and vulnerability databases enable automated triage — enriching alerts with context, correlating indicators across sources, and prioritizing based on organizational risk.

**Threat intelligence requires cross-source correlation.** Effective threat analysis requires checking indicators of compromise (IOCs) across multiple sources — VirusTotal for file hashes, Shodan for exposed infrastructure, WHOIS for domain registration, AbuseIPDB for IP reputation, and MITRE ATT&CK for technique mapping. MCP servers for each of these sources let AI agents perform multi-source correlation automatically.

**Incident response demands speed and breadth.** When an incident occurs, responders need to query logs, check endpoint status, analyze suspicious files, investigate network traffic, and document findings — often within minutes. MCP-connected agents can execute these investigative steps in parallel, dramatically reducing mean time to respond (MTTR).

       │  Analyst    │          │   Positive) │
       └─────────────┘          └─────────────┘
```

The agent receives a SIEM alert, checks the associated IOCs against VirusTotal (file hash reputation), Shodan (IP exposure and services), and AbuseIPDB (IP reputation score). Based on the enrichment results, it either escalates with context to a human analyst or auto-closes the alert as a false positive with documented reasoning.

### Pattern 2: Automated Vulnerability Assessment Pipeline

An AI agent conducts systematic vulnerability assessment across an organization's attack surface.

```
   ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐
   │  Nmap MCP    │    │ masscan MCP  │    │ ExternalAtk  │
   │  (service    │    │ (fast port   │    │  MCP (attack │
   │  detection)  │    │  scanning)   │    │  surface)    │
   └──────┬───────┘    └──────┬───────┘    └──────┬───────┘
          │                   │                    │
          └───────────────────┼────────────────────┘
                              │
                    ┌─────────▼─────────┐
                    │    AI Agent       │
                    │ (Orchestrator)    │
                    └─────────┬─────────┘
                              │
          ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐
          │                   │                   │
   ┌──────▼──────┐    ┌──────▼──────┐    ┌──────▼──────┐
   │ Nuclei MCP  │    │  Trivy MCP  │    │ Semgrep MCP │
   │ (8000+      │    │ (container  │    │ (code       │
   │  templates) │    │  & IaC)     │    │  analysis)  │
   └──────┬──────┘    └──────┬──────┘    └──────┬──────┘
          │                   │                   │
          └───────────────────┼───────────────────┘
                              │
                    ┌─────────▼─────────┐
                    │  Prioritized      │
                    │  Vulnerability    │
                    │  Report + CVSS    │
                    └───────────────────┘
```

The agent first discovers the attack surface using Nmap (service detection), masscan (fast port scanning), and ExternalAttacker (attack surface mapping). It then feeds discovered services into Nuclei (template-based vulnerability scanning), Trivy (container and infrastructure scanning), and Semgrep (code-level analysis). The results are correlated, deduplicated, and prioritized by CVSS score and exploitability.

### Pattern 3: Threat Intelligence Correlation Agent

An AI agent performs multi-source threat intelligence correlation when investigating suspicious indicators.

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │  Suspicious IOC  │
                    │  (IP, hash,     │
                    │   domain, URL)  │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
                    ┌────────▼────────┐
                    │    AI Agent     │
                    │  (Correlator)   │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
   ┌──────────┬──────────┬───┼───┬──────────┬──────────┐
   │          │          │       │          │          │
┌──▼──┐  ┌───▼───┐  ┌───▼──┐ ┌─▼───┐  ┌───▼───┐  ┌──▼──┐
│ VT  │  │Shodan │  │ OTX  │  │DNS- │  │Google │  │Abuse│

└──┬──┘  └───┬───┘  └───┬──┘ └─┬───┘  └───┬───┘  └──┬──┘
   │         │          │      │          │          │
   └─────────┴──────────┴──┬───┴──────────┴──────────┘
                           │
                    ┌──────▼──────┐
                    │  MITRE      │
                    │  ATT&CK     │
                    │  Mapping    │
                    └──────┬──────┘
                           │
                    ┌──────▼──────┐
                    │ Threat      │
                    │ Assessment  │
                    │ Report      │
                    └─────────────┘
```

Given a suspicious indicator, the agent queries six threat intelligence sources in parallel — VirusTotal (malware analysis), Shodan (infrastructure exposure), AlienVault OTX (community intelligence), DNStwist (related phishing domains), Google Threat Intelligence (Mandiant data), and AbuseIPDB (IP reputation). Results are correlated and mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques for a structured threat assessment.

### Pattern 4: AI-Assisted Reverse Engineering Pipeline

An AI agent performs automated binary analysis and malware triage.

```
   ┌─────────────────┐
   │  Unknown Binary  │
   │  (PE/ELF/Mach-O) │
   └────────┬─────────┘
            │
   ┌────────▼────────┐
   │   AI Agent      │
   │  (Analyst)      │
   └────────┬────────┘
            │
   ┌────────▼────────┐
   │  TriageMCP      │
   │  (static PE     │
   │   analysis)     │
   └────────┬────────┘
            │
   ┌────────┼────────────────┐
   │                         │
┌──▼─────────┐     ┌────────▼────────┐
│  YARA MCP  │     │   capa MCP      │
│  (pattern  │     │   (capability   │
│  matching) │     │    detection)   │
└──┬─────────┘     └────────┬────────┘
   │                         │
   └────────┬────────────────┘
            │
   ┌────────▼────────┐
   │  GhidraMCP      │
   │  (deep decom-   │
   │   pilation)     │
   └────────┬────────┘
            │
   ┌────────▼────────┐
   │  VirusTotal MCP │
   │  (community     │
   │   intelligence) │
   └────────┬────────┘
            │
   ┌────────▼────────┐
   │  Malware Report │
   │  + ATT&CK Map   │
   │  + IOCs         │
   └──────────────────┘
```

The agent receives an unknown binary and runs it through a triage pipeline: TriageMCP performs initial static analysis (imports, sections, strings), YARA checks against known malware patterns, capa identifies behavioral capabilities, GhidraMCP performs deep decompilation for detailed code analysis, and VirusTotal provides community detection and intelligence data. The output is a structured malware report with MITRE ATT&CK mapping and extracted IOCs.

## Regulatory and Ethical Considerations

Cybersecurity MCP servers operate in a domain with significant legal and ethical constraints.

### Authorization and Scope

Penetration testing MCP servers must only be used against authorized targets. Several implementations (notably Pentest-MCP-Server) include built-in scope enforcement with allowlist/blocklist systems. Organizations deploying offensive MCP tools should ensure that authorization documentation, rules of engagement, and scope definitions are in place before any AI-driven testing begins. Unauthorized scanning or testing can violate computer fraud and abuse laws in virtually every jurisdiction.

### Data Privacy and Compliance

SIEM and threat intelligence MCP servers handle sensitive security data that may be subject to data protection regulations. Security logs often contain personally identifiable information (PII), and sharing this data with external AI services raises compliance considerations under GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy frameworks. Organizations should evaluate whether MCP server deployments keep sensitive data on-premises or transmit it to external services.

### Responsible Disclosure

Vulnerability scanning MCP servers may discover previously unknown vulnerabilities. Organizations should have responsible disclosure policies in place and ensure that AI agents discovering vulnerabilities route findings through appropriate channels rather than acting autonomously on critical findings.

### MCP Security Risks

The MCP ecosystem itself has faced significant security challenges in 2026. Between January and February, over 30 CVEs were filed against MCP infrastructure. A survey of 2,614 MCP implementations found that 82% use file operations vulnerable to path traversal, two-thirds have code injection risk, and over a third are susceptible to command injection. A scan of 8,000+ MCP servers on the public internet found 38% completely lack authentication. Organizations deploying MCP servers for security operations should apply the same security rigor to their MCP infrastructure as they would to any other security tool.

### Ethical AI in Security

AI-assisted security operations raise questions about autonomous action. Security MCP servers should be configured with appropriate human-in-the-loop controls, especially for actions that could disrupt services, modify configurations, or access sensitive data. The principle of least privilege applies: MCP servers should expose only the minimum functionality needed for the intended use case.

## Ecosystem Gaps

Despite strong coverage in many categories, significant gaps remain in the cybersecurity MCP ecosystem.

**No major EDR vendor has a standalone MCP server.** CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Carbon Black, and Cortex XDR have no official MCP servers. Microsoft's Sentinel MCP provides indirect Defender access, but dedicated EDR MCP servers remain absent. Given that EDR is central to incident response, this is a critical gap.

**No vulnerability management platforms have official MCP servers.** Qualys, Tenable (Nessus), Rapid7 (InsightVM), and Nexpose have no MCP presence. Community Nuclei and Trivy servers partially fill the gap, but enterprise vulnerability management workflows remain unconnected.

**No SOAR platforms beyond Google have official MCP servers.** Palo Alto XSOAR, Splunk SOAR, Swimlane, and Tines have no official MCP servers. SOAR is a natural fit for MCP — automated playbooks triggered by AI analysis — but official support is limited to Google's implementation.

**No case management or ticketing systems for security.** TheHive, DFIR-IRIS, ServiceNow SecOps, and Jira-based security workflows have no dedicated security MCP servers. Case management is essential for tracking investigations and coordinating response.

**No commercial threat intelligence platforms.** Recorded Future, ThreatConnect, MISP (as an official server), and Anomali have no MCP presence. While VirusTotal, OTX, and AbuseIPDB provide good coverage for open-source threat intelligence, commercial platforms with deeper analysis remain unconnected.

**No network security monitoring tools.** Suricata, Snort, Zeek, and Security Onion have no MCP servers. Network-level threat detection and traffic analysis remain outside the MCP ecosystem.

**No compliance and GRC platforms.** Archer, ServiceNow GRC, OneTrust, and compliance frameworks like NIST CSF have no MCP presence. Compliance reporting is a natural AI use case but lacks MCP support.

**No deception technology.** Honeypots, deception platforms (Attivo/SentinelOne, Illusive Networks), and canary tokens have no MCP servers. Deception technology could benefit from AI-driven deployment and monitoring.

## Getting Started

### For SOC Analysts
Start with a SIEM MCP server (Google SecOps or Wazuh) connected to your existing security data. Add VirusTotal and Shodan MCP servers for alert enrichment. This combination enables AI-assisted alert triage — the highest-impact use case for security teams. Begin with read-only access and expand as you build confidence in the AI's analysis quality.

### For Penetration Testers
The FuzzingLabs mcp-security-hub provides the most comprehensive starting point — 38 Docker-containerized servers covering reconnaissance through exploitation. For a lighter start, use Nmap MCP for network scanning and Nuclei MCP for vulnerability detection. Always configure scope enforcement and ensure written authorization before any testing.

### For Threat Intelligence Analysts
Connect VirusTotal, Shodan, and AlienVault OTX MCP servers for multi-source IOC analysis. Add DNStwist for phishing domain monitoring. The fastmcp-threatintel server aggregates multiple sources with automatic MITRE ATT&CK mapping, providing a starting framework for structured threat analysis.

### For Malware Analysts
GhidraMCP (8,100 stars) is the essential starting point for binary analysis. Add YARA MCP for pattern matching, capa MCP for capability detection, and VirusTotal for community intelligence. This combination enables an AI-assisted malware analysis pipeline from initial triage through detailed decompilation.

### For Security Engineers
Start with Semgrep MCP for code security scanning and Gitleaks MCP for secrets detection in CI/CD pipelines. Add Trivy MCP for container security scanning. These tools integrate naturally into DevSecOps workflows and can be invoked by AI agents as part of automated code review.

### For Security Leaders
Deploy Snyk Agent Scan to audit your existing MCP server deployments for security issues. Use Google SecOps or Microsoft Sentinel MCP servers to explore AI-assisted security operations. Focus on read-only analytical use cases first before enabling any automated response actions.

## Conclusion

Cybersecurity is one of the most active and commercially engaged MCP verticals, with official servers from Google, Microsoft, PortSwigger, Semgrep, Snyk, Check Point, Elastic, and Cloudflare. The community ecosystem adds hundreds more — from GhidraMCP's 8,100 stars leading reverse engineering to FuzzingLabs' 38-server security hub covering 300+ offensive tools. The AI in cybersecurity market's projected growth from $25–31 billion to $86–105 billion by 2030 suggests this ecosystem will continue expanding rapidly.

Critical gaps remain in EDR, vulnerability management, SOAR, case management, and network monitoring. The absence of official MCP servers from CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Qualys, Tenable, and Palo Alto XSOAR means that the most commercially important security tools remain outside the MCP ecosystem. As the protocol matures — and particularly as MCP security itself improves beyond the challenges documented in early 2026 — we expect major security vendors to follow Google and Microsoft's lead in releasing official MCP servers.

For security teams evaluating MCP adoption, the recommendation is clear: start with read-only analytical use cases (alert enrichment, threat intelligence correlation, vulnerability prioritization), build confidence in AI-assisted analysis quality, and expand toward automated response only with appropriate human-in-the-loop controls. The combination of SOC alert fatigue, chronic staffing shortages, and increasingly sophisticated threats makes AI-augmented security operations not just valuable but necessary.

## Frequently asked questions

**Can AI agents perform penetration testing through MCP servers?**

Yes, but with important caveats. FuzzingLabs' mcp-security-hub bundles 38 Docker-containerized MCP servers covering 300+ offensive security tools — from Nmap network scanning to Nuclei vulnerability detection to Metasploit exploitation. Scope enforcement and written authorization are essential. These servers enable AI-assisted pentesting, not fully autonomous attacks — a human operator should always review and approve exploitation actions.

**Which cybersecurity MCP servers are officially supported by vendors?**

Major vendors with official MCP servers include Google (Security Operations, 458 stars), PortSwigger (Burp Suite, 376 stars), Semgrep (code scanning, 189 stars), Snyk (vulnerability analysis), Check Point (threat intelligence), Elastic (SIEM/log analysis), Microsoft (Sentinel, preview), and Cloudflare (DNS/CDN security). Official servers generally have better authentication, documentation, and long-term support than community alternatives.

**Are MCP servers themselves secure?**

MCP infrastructure has its own attack surface. Between January and February 2026, security researchers filed over 30 CVEs targeting MCP servers. Common issues include tool poisoning (malicious prompt injection through tool descriptions), excessive permissions, insecure credential storage, and lack of input validation. Use read-only configurations initially, audit server source code, and apply the principle of least privilege. Our [MCP Server Security Guide](/guides/mcp-server-security/) covers this in depth.

**Can MCP servers connect to my SIEM platform?**

Yes, for several major platforms. Google Security Operations has an official MCP server (458 stars) for alert investigation and event search. Elastic has an official MCP server with Kibana-based detection and ESQL queries. Microsoft Sentinel has a preview MCP server for incident management. Splunk has community implementations. However, CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, and Palo Alto XSOAR do not yet have MCP servers.

**What's the best starting point for security teams evaluating MCP?**

Start with read-only analytical use cases. Connect VirusTotal, Shodan, and AlienVault OTX MCP servers for multi-source IOC (Indicator of Compromise) analysis. Add Semgrep MCP for code security scanning in your development pipeline. These are low-risk, high-value integrations. Expand to automated response actions only after building confidence in AI-assisted analysis quality, and always maintain human-in-the-loop controls for any destructive or blocking actions.
