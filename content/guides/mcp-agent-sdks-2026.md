The AI agent SDK landscape in 2026 looks nothing like it did a year ago. While [LangChain, CrewAI, and the OpenAI Agents SDK](/guides/mcp-agent-framework-integrations/) remain popular, a new wave of SDKs has emerged — each with a different philosophy about how agents should work, how they should connect to tools via MCP, and how production systems should be built.

This guide covers five SDKs that represent distinct approaches to agent development: **Claude Agent SDK**, **Microsoft Agent Framework** (the AutoGen + Semantic Kernel merger), **AG2** (the community AutoGen fork), **Mastra** (TypeScript-native), and **mcp-agent** (workflow-first). Our analysis draws on published documentation, benchmarks, and community reports — we research and analyze rather than building production systems with each SDK ourselves.

## The Landscape Shift

Three things changed in late 2025 and early 2026 that reshaped the SDK landscape:

**MCP became table stakes.** With over 97 million monthly SDK downloads and 10,000+ indexed MCP servers, every serious agent framework now supports MCP natively. The question isn't whether to use MCP — it's how deeply the SDK integrates with it.

**Agent-to-agent coordination matured.** The [A2A protocol](/guides/mcp-vs-a2a-protocol-comparison/) moved from proposal to adoption, and the [Agentic AI Foundation](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-mcp-roadmap/) (AAIF) brought MCP and A2A under shared governance. SDKs now need strategies for both tool access (MCP) and agent coordination (A2A).

**Context window management became a first-class concern.** As documented in our [MCP cost optimization guide](/guides/mcp-cost-optimization/), MCP tool schemas can consume 40-50% of context windows. SDKs that solve this problem — through code execution patterns, context editing, or dynamic tool discovery — have a significant production advantage.

## Claude Agent SDK

**Language:** Python
**Source:** [github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python)
**Model support:** Claude models only
**MCP integration:** Native, deep

The Claude Agent SDK is Anthropic's opinionated take on agent development. Its core philosophy is a tight loop: **gather context → take action → verify work → repeat.** Rather than exposing complex orchestration primitives, it makes simple things simple and handles the hard problems (context management, tool discovery, multi-agent coordination) at the infrastructure level.

### Architecture

The SDK builds on three key ideas:

**MCP as the universal integration layer.** Rather than defining a custom tool format, the SDK uses MCP servers for all external integrations — Slack, GitHub, Asana, databases, and custom tools. Pre-built MCP servers handle authentication and connection management automatically. Custom tools are implemented as in-process MCP servers, meaning you don't need to run a separate process for each tool.

**Subagents for parallel execution.** The orchestrator agent can spawn subagents that run in parallel with isolated context windows. Only relevant results return to the orchestrator, which keeps the main context clean. This is structurally similar to the supervisor/worker pattern described in our [multi-agent architectures guide](/guides/mcp-multi-agent-architectures/), but implemented as a first-class SDK feature rather than something you wire up yourself.

**Context editing.** This is the SDK's most distinctive feature. In long agent sessions, stale tool call outputs accumulate in the context window, wasting tokens and degrading performance. Context editing automatically clears old outputs while preserving the conversation flow. According to Anthropic's published evaluations, this reduces token consumption by 84% in 100-turn sessions — a dramatic improvement for long-running workflows.

### When to Use It

The Claude Agent SDK is the natural choice when you're already committed to Claude models and want the fastest path to production-quality agents. The tight MCP integration and context editing give it a real efficiency advantage for long-running, tool-heavy workflows. The tradeoff is vendor lock-in — you can't swap in GPT-4 or Gemini without switching SDKs entirely.

## Microsoft Agent Framework

**Language:** Python, .NET
**Source:** Part of the broader Microsoft AI ecosystem
**Model support:** Multi-model (Azure OpenAI, others)
**MCP integration:** Protocol-level support
**Status:** RC 1.0 released February 19, 2026; GA targeted end of Q1 2026

The Microsoft Agent Framework is the result of merging AutoGen and Semantic Kernel into a unified platform. It represents the enterprise approach to agent development — graph-based workflows, checkpointing, human-in-the-loop patterns, and deep integration with the Azure ecosystem.

### Architecture

The framework is built around several core concepts:

**Graph-based workflows.** Agent interactions are modeled as directed graphs. Nodes represent agents, tools, or decision points. Edges define flow control — sequential, parallel, or conditional. This gives you explicit control over execution order, which matters in regulated industries where you need auditable, deterministic workflows.

**Protocol-native.** The framework supports both MCP (for tool access) and A2A (for agent coordination) at the protocol level. This means you can connect to any MCP server for tools while using A2A to coordinate with agents running on different frameworks entirely.

**Streaming and checkpointing.** Long-running workflows can stream intermediate results and checkpoint state. If a workflow fails at step 47, you can resume from step 46 rather than starting over. Combined with human-in-the-loop patterns, this enables workflows where agents and humans alternate control.

**Cross-language support.** Python and .NET are first-class citizens, which matters for organizations with mixed-language codebases — a common situation in enterprise environments.

### When to Use It

The Microsoft Agent Framework is purpose-built for enterprise teams already invested in Azure. If you need audit trails, deterministic workflows, checkpointing, and compliance controls, this is the most mature option. The learning curve is steep, and the framework carries significant complexity. If you're building a simple tool-calling agent, this is overkill.

## AG2 (Formerly AutoGen, Community Fork)

**Language:** Python
**Source:** [ag2.ai](https://www.ag2.ai/)
**Model support:** Multi-model
**MCP integration:** Native
**Origin:** Community fork from the original AutoGen creators

When Microsoft merged AutoGen into the Agent Framework, the original AutoGen team forked the project as AG2 — an open-source "AgentOS" focused on interoperability between agent frameworks.

### Architecture

AG2's distinctive feature is its **universal runtime**: it can connect agents from AG2, Google ADK, OpenAI, and LangChain into a single coordinated team. This means you're not locked into one framework per project — you can have a LangChain agent handling retrieval, an OpenAI agent handling generation, and an AG2 agent orchestrating both.

**A2A and MCP support** means AG2 agents can access tools via MCP servers and coordinate with external agents via A2A. Enterprise security features (authentication, authorization, audit logging) are built into the runtime rather than bolted on.

**Conversational agent model.** Like the original AutoGen, AG2 models multi-agent interaction as conversations. Agents send messages to each other, and the runtime manages turn-taking, tool calls, and state. This is more intuitive than graph-based approaches for many developers, though it can be harder to debug in complex workflows.

### When to Use It

AG2 makes sense when you need to compose agents from multiple frameworks into a single system. If you have existing LangChain agents and want to add Google ADK agents without rewriting everything, AG2's universal runtime solves that problem. The open-source governance model also matters for organizations that won't accept vendor-controlled dependencies.

## Mastra

**Language:** TypeScript
**Source:** [mastra.ai](https://mastra.ai/)
**Model support:** Multi-model
**MCP integration:** Native (client and server)
**Origin:** From the team behind Gatsby

Mastra is the TypeScript-native option in the agent SDK space. Built by the team behind Gatsby, it brings web development patterns to agent development — including a graph-based workflow engine that reads like modern JavaScript.

### Architecture

**Fluent workflow syntax.** Mastra workflows use a chainable API: `.then()`, `.branch()`, `.parallel()`. If you've built web applications, this feels familiar. Each step can access MCP tools, call LLMs, or delegate to sub-workflows. The syntax trades some flexibility for readability.

```
// Conceptual example — not tested by us
workflow
  .then(fetchData)
  .branch({
    complex: analyzeDeep,
    simple: summarize
  })
  .parallel([notify, log])
```

**Bidirectional MCP.** Mastra provides both `MCPClient` (connect to existing MCP servers) and `MCPServer` (expose Mastra tools and agents as MCP servers). This means a Mastra agent can both consume and provide MCP tools — useful for building composable agent systems.

**Elicitation support.** Mastra implements MCP's [elicitation feature](/guides/mcp-elicitation-explained/), allowing MCP servers to pause mid-execution and request structured input from users. This enables human-in-the-loop patterns without custom UI code.

**Pause/resume storage.** Workflow state can be persisted, allowing long-running workflows to pause (for human input, external events, or scheduled delays) and resume later. This is essential for workflows that span hours or days rather than seconds.

### When to Use It

Mastra is the clear choice for TypeScript teams. If your backend is Node.js and your frontend is React, Mastra integrates naturally. The workflow syntax is more approachable than graph-based alternatives, though it's less battle-tested in production than Python-based options. The bidirectional MCP support is a genuine differentiator if you're building composable agent infrastructure.

## mcp-agent (LastMile AI)

**Language:** Python
**Source:** [github.com/lastmile-ai/mcp-agent](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/mcp-agent)
**Model support:** Multi-model
**MCP integration:** MCP-first design
**Philosophy:** "Write code, not graphs"

mcp-agent from LastMile AI takes the opposite approach from graph-based frameworks. Its philosophy is that agent workflows should be regular Python code — branching with `if` statements, looping with `while` loops, composing with function calls.

### Architecture

**Composable workflow patterns.** mcp-agent provides pre-built patterns as building blocks:

- **Orchestrator** — decomposes tasks and delegates to sub-agents
- **Evaluator-Optimizer** — two LLMs in a loop, one generating and one critiquing
- **Router** — classifies inputs and routes to specialized handlers
- **Map-Reduce** — fans out work across parallel agents, then aggregates
- **Parallel** — runs multiple agents simultaneously

Each pattern is a Python class you can compose, nest, and extend. An orchestrator can contain evaluator-optimizers; a router can delegate to map-reduce workflows.

**Deep Orchestrator.** The most ambitious pattern: an adaptive planning system inspired by Anthropic's multi-agent research. It dynamically creates sub-agents, accumulates knowledge across steps, and replans when results differ from expectations. Designed for long-horizon research tasks where the plan evolves as the agent learns.

**Code over configuration.** Where other frameworks define workflows as graphs, YAML, or DSLs, mcp-agent workflows are just Python. This means you get the full power of the language — exception handling, conditional logic, library imports — without learning a framework-specific abstraction.

### When to Use It

mcp-agent is ideal for developers who want to build complex agent workflows without learning a new abstraction layer. If you're comfortable writing Python and want composable patterns you can understand by reading the code, mcp-agent delivers. It's less suitable if you need visual workflow editing, built-in checkpointing, or enterprise-grade audit trails.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Claude Agent SDK | Microsoft Agent Framework | AG2 | Mastra | mcp-agent |
|---------|-----------------|--------------------------|-----|--------|-----------|
| **Language** | Python | Python, .NET | Python | TypeScript | Python |
| **Model lock-in** | Claude only | Multi-model | Multi-model | Multi-model | Multi-model |
| **MCP depth** | Deep (in-process servers) | Protocol-level | Native | Bidirectional | MCP-first |
| **A2A support** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| **Multi-agent** | Subagents | Graph-based | Universal runtime | Workflow delegation | Composable patterns |

| **Learning curve** | Low | High | Medium | Low-Medium | Low |
| **Best for** | Claude-native production | Enterprise/Azure | Multi-framework composition | TypeScript teams | Developers who want code, not frameworks |

## Choosing the Right SDK

The decision tree is shorter than it looks:

**Are you building on Claude models?** The Claude Agent SDK's context editing and deep MCP integration give it a meaningful production advantage. The vendor lock-in is real, but if you're already committed to Claude, this is the most efficient path.

**Do you need enterprise compliance and audit trails?** Microsoft Agent Framework is designed for this. The complexity is the cost of deterministic, auditable workflows.

**Do you have agents from multiple frameworks that need to work together?** AG2's universal runtime is the only option that lets you compose LangChain, OpenAI, and Google ADK agents into a single system without rewriting them.

**Is your team TypeScript-first?** Mastra. There's no close second in the TypeScript agent space.

**Do you want maximum control with minimum abstraction?** mcp-agent gives you composable patterns as Python classes. You write the orchestration logic yourself, using standard language features.

**None of the above?** Start with the SDK that matches your primary model provider. If model flexibility matters more than anything else, AG2 or mcp-agent are the safest bets.

## Production Considerations

Regardless of which SDK you choose, the same production challenges apply:

### Cost Management

Multi-agent systems cost 2-5x more than single-agent approaches — typically $2-$5 per task versus $0.10-$0.50 for single agents. As documented in our [cost optimization guide](/guides/mcp-cost-optimization/), MCP tool schemas are the primary cost driver. SDKs that address this (Claude Agent SDK's context editing, mcp-agent's code execution patterns) have a significant cost advantage at scale.

### Security

Every MCP connection is a potential attack surface. [Tool poisoning attacks](https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-security-notification-tool-poisoning-attacks), where malicious instructions are embedded in tool descriptions, affect all SDKs equally — the model reads the tool description regardless of which framework manages the connection. Our [MCP attack vectors guide](/guides/mcp-attack-vectors-defense/) covers defenses in detail.

### Context Window Exhaustion

Long-running agent sessions inevitably hit context limits. Only the Claude Agent SDK addresses this at the framework level (context editing). With other SDKs, you'll need to implement your own strategies: conversation summarization, sliding windows, or the code execution pattern where agents write scripts that call tools as APIs rather than passing results through the context.

Anthropic's published benchmarks for the code execution pattern show token reduction from ~150,000 to ~2,000 — a 98.7% decrease. This pattern works with any SDK, but you'll need to implement it yourself outside the Claude Agent SDK.

### Timeline Expectations

Realistic timelines to production-ready agent systems are 4-6 months, not weeks. The SDK is the easy part — the hard work is tool design, error handling, observability, security hardening, and cost optimization. Choose your SDK based on where you want to spend your engineering time, not which one has the flashiest demo.

## What's Next

The agent SDK landscape will continue consolidating through 2026. The [MCP 2026 roadmap](/guides/mcp-2026-roadmap-whats-coming/) prioritizes transport evolution, async task support, and enterprise readiness — all of which will flow into SDK capabilities. The AAIF's joint governance of MCP and A2A should drive better integration between tool access and agent coordination.

For now, the best SDK is the one that matches your team's language, model provider, and production requirements. The protocol layer (MCP + A2A) is converging; the SDK layer remains fragmented. Choose the SDK that lets you focus on your application logic rather than fighting framework complexity.
