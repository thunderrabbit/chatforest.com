The automotive industry sits at the intersection of several converging revolutions: electrification, software-defined vehicles, autonomous driving, and AI-assisted operations. Each of these creates data — enormous amounts of it — and each requires tools to make sense of that data. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is beginning to bridge the gap between AI agents and the automotive ecosystem, though coverage remains uneven.

Tesla is the standout: three separate MCP server implementations allow AI agents to monitor, analyze, and even control Tesla vehicles through the Fleet API. Vehicle diagnostics have two impressive implementations — one that virtualizes an entire CAN bus for LLM interaction, another that runs MCP firmware directly on an OBD-II dongle. Automotive cybersecurity compliance has a dedicated server mapping R155, R156, and ISO 21434 with 87 cross-framework mappings.

But large swaths of the industry remain untouched. No MCP servers exist for AUTOSAR toolchains, dealership management systems, autonomous driving simulators, major fleet telematics platforms, or most OEM APIs beyond Tesla. The contrast between Tesla's API openness and every other manufacturer's closed ecosystem defines the current landscape.

This guide is research-based. We survey what MCP servers exist for automotive applications, what adjacent tools are relevant, how major platforms are approaching agentic AI, and how architecture patterns can tie these pieces together. We do not claim to have tested or used any of these servers hands-on. [Rob Nugen](https://robnugen.com), the operator of this site, has established ChatForest as a research and documentation resource for the AI ecosystem. For background on MCP itself, see our [introduction to MCP](/guides/what-is-mcp/) and the [MCP server directory](/guides/mcp-server-directory/).


## Why Automotive Needs MCP

The automotive industry generates more data per vehicle than almost any other consumer product. A modern connected car produces up to 25 GB of data per hour from sensors, telematics, infotainment, and drivetrain systems. Fleet operators managing thousands of vehicles face data volumes that overwhelm traditional dashboards. AI agents that can reason about this data — diagnosing faults, optimizing routes, predicting maintenance, checking compliance — need structured access to automotive systems.

Four structural characteristics explain why MCP matters here.

**Protocol fragmentation across vehicle systems.** A single vehicle contains dozens of electronic control units (ECUs) communicating over CAN bus, LIN, FlexRay, and automotive Ethernet. Diagnostic tools speak OBD-II (with manufacturer-specific extensions). Fleet management platforms use proprietary APIs. Charging infrastructure speaks OCPP. Navigation services expose REST APIs. An AI agent that needs to diagnose a vehicle fault, check its charging history, and verify compliance must navigate multiple protocols and data formats. MCP provides a standard interface layer.

**Regulatory complexity across markets.** Automotive is one of the most heavily regulated industries on earth. UNECE R155 mandates cybersecurity management systems for type approval in the EU, Japan, and South Korea. ISO/SAE 21434 defines the engineering process. R156 covers software update management. AUTOSAR defines software architecture standards. Regional emissions standards, safety regulations, and data privacy laws (GDPR for connected car data) add further layers. AI agents assisting with compliance must access and cross-reference multiple regulatory frameworks simultaneously.

**The software-defined vehicle transition.** OEMs are moving from hardware-centric to software-centric vehicle architectures. BMW's Neue Klasse platform, Mercedes-Benz's MB.OS, Volkswagen's partnership with Rivian, and Stellantis's STLA Brain represent billions of dollars of investment in vehicle software platforms. This transition creates new categories of automotive work — software configuration, OTA update management, feature activation, digital twin modeling — that AI agents can assist with, but only if they can access vehicle software systems through standardized interfaces.

**Multi-stakeholder data needs.** The automotive value chain spans OEMs, tier-1 suppliers, dealers, fleet operators, aftermarket service providers, insurance companies, and regulators — each needing different views of the same vehicle data. A fleet operator needs real-time telemetry. A mechanic needs diagnostic codes. A compliance officer needs cybersecurity audit trails. MCP's tool-based architecture lets different agents access shared vehicle data through appropriate interfaces with appropriate access controls.


## Vehicle Diagnostics and CAN Bus

Vehicle diagnostics represent the most technically ambitious MCP implementations in the automotive space — directly bridging AI agents with the internal communication networks of vehicles.

### MCP-CAN: Virtual CAN Bus for AI

**MCP-CAN** (GitHub: farzadnadiri/MCP-CAN, Python, MIT) is purpose-built to surface vehicle CAN/OBD data to large language models. It simulates ECUs on a virtual CAN bus, decodes signals via DBC files, and exposes MCP tools over SSE — no vehicle hardware required by default.

The architecture is notable: rather than just wrapping an API, MCP-CAN virtualizes the entire vehicle communication network. The ECU simulator streams multiple CAN messages plus demo OBD-II responses, while the DBC-driven encoding/decoding (via cantools) translates raw CAN frames into human-readable signal values.

Key capabilities:
- Virtual CAN backend (python-can) out of the box; optional SocketCAN/vCAN on Linux for real hardware
- ECU simulator streaming engine RPM, vehicle speed, oil temperature, and other signals
- MCP server (SSE) exposing tools for frame capture, signal filtering, monitoring, and DBC schema information
- OBD-II request simulation (service/PID queries)
- CLI tools: `mcp-can simulate`, `mcp-can server`, `mcp-can frames`, `mcp-can decode`, `mcp-can monitor`, `mcp-can obd-request`
- Docker + docker compose for server and simulator
- Unit tests, type hints, ruff/mypy lint configuration

For developers building automotive AI agents, MCP-CAN provides a complete development environment without requiring access to a physical vehicle. An AI agent can query engine parameters, decode diagnostic data, and monitor vehicle state — all through standard MCP tool calls against a simulated vehicle.

### Embedded-MCP-ELM327: MCP on the OBD-II Dongle

**Embedded-MCP-ELM327** (GitHub: castlebbs/Embedded-MCP-ELM327, C, hackathon project) takes the opposite approach: instead of simulating a vehicle, it puts an MCP server directly on the OBD-II hardware. Running on FreeRTOS/lwIP on a W600 WiFi SoC, it replaces the firmware of the secondary MCU in commodity OBD-II dongles, allowing AI agents to communicate with the dongle without any intermediary server.

Features include:
- Complete ELM327 OBD-II command interface with UART communication
- Built-in OBD-II simulation mode for testing without a vehicle
- WiFi connectivity (access point or station mode)
- RESTful HTTP endpoint for MCP communication
- Over-the-air firmware updates
- Non-blocking UDP syslog for remote monitoring

This is significant because it demonstrates MCP running on embedded hardware — not a cloud service, not a desktop application, but firmware on a $10 OBD-II dongle. The hackathon origins mean it is experimental, but the concept of embedded MCP servers in automotive hardware points toward a future where every diagnostic tool speaks MCP natively.

### Vehicle-Diagnostic-Assistant

**Vehicle-Diagnostic-Assistant** (GitHub: castlebbs/Vehicle-Diagnostic-Assistant, Python, hackathon project) is the companion AI agent for Embedded-MCP-ELM327. Built with LangGraph for stateful conversation management with streaming support, it demonstrates the end-to-end workflow: a user describes a vehicle symptom in natural language, the agent queries the OBD-II dongle through MCP, reads diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs), decodes VINs, retrieves vehicle specs, and provides diagnostic guidance.

The agent handles:
- Reading real-time PID data (RPM, speed, temperatures) via OBD-II commands
- VIN decoding to identify make, model, year, and engine specifications
- DTC analysis with explanation and repair guidance
- Historical PID data retrieval and trend analysis

Together, these three projects — MCP-CAN for development/simulation, Embedded-MCP-ELM327 for hardware, and Vehicle-Diagnostic-Assistant for the agent layer — represent the most complete MCP diagnostic stack in any industry.


## Tesla Integration

Tesla has the most developed MCP ecosystem of any automaker, reflecting both the openness of Tesla's Fleet API and the enthusiasm of the Tesla developer community. Three implementations cover different use cases.

### tesla-mcp: Fleet API Control

**tesla-mcp** (GitHub: scald/tesla-mcp, ~13 stars, TypeScript) connects to the Tesla Fleet API, allowing AI assistants to monitor and control Tesla vehicles. It uses Tesla's OAuth 2.0 authentication flow, requiring a Client ID and Client Secret from the Tesla Developer Portal.

Current capabilities include waking vehicles from sleep, retrieving detailed vehicle information, and refreshing vehicle data. The server is designed for Claude, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible clients.

Important limitation: as of late 2023, Tesla deprecated many vehicle command endpoints in their REST API. Commands like honking the horn now require the Tesla Vehicle Command Protocol rather than the REST API. This MCP server currently supports only REST API endpoints that remain functional, which means read operations and basic commands work, but many direct vehicle control operations require the newer protocol.

### teslamate-mcp: Analytics and History

**teslamate-mcp** (GitHub: cobanov/teslamate-mcp, 103 stars, Python) connects to a TeslaMate PostgreSQL database, enabling natural language queries about Tesla vehicle data and analytics. TeslaMate is a popular self-hosted data logger for Tesla vehicles with 6,000+ stars.

The server provides 18 predefined queries covering:
- Battery health and degradation tracking
- Charging history and efficiency
- Driving patterns and trip analysis
- Energy consumption and efficiency metrics
- Location analytics
- Software update history

It also supports custom SQL queries with built-in validation (safe SELECT queries only) and database schema exploration. Optional bearer token authentication supports remote deployments.

At 103 stars, this is the most popular automotive MCP server by GitHub metrics — reflecting that many Tesla owners already run TeslaMate and want AI-powered analysis of their accumulated data.

### mcp-teslamate-fleet: Analytics + Live Control

**mcp-teslamate-fleet** (GitHub: lodordev/mcp-teslamate-fleet, TypeScript) is the first MCP server to combine both TeslaMate historical analytics and Tesla Fleet API live commands in a single server. Users can configure just one data source or both.

Analytics tools: `tesla_status`, `tesla_drives`, `tesla_charging_history`, `tesla_battery_health`, `tesla_efficiency`, `tesla_location_history`, `tesla_state_history`, `tesla_software_updates`

Command tools: `tesla_climate_on/off`, `tesla_set_temp`, `tesla_charge_start/stop`, `tesla_set_charge_limit`, `tesla_lock`, `tesla_unlock`, `tesla_honk`, `tesla_flash`, `tesla_trunk`

Safety features include requiring `confirm=True` for unlock and trunk commands, with all commands rate-limited to 40 per day. This rate limiting is important — Tesla's API has its own rate limits, and excessive polling can drain vehicle batteries.

The combined analytics-plus-commands approach enables workflows like: "Show me my charging efficiency over the last month, and if the car is at home, start charging at the off-peak rate."


## Vehicle Data APIs

### CarsXE MCP Server

**CarsXE MCP Server** (GitHub: carsxe/carsxe-mcp-server, TypeScript/Node.js) provides a modular, extensible MCP interface for querying and analyzing vehicle data from the CarsXE API, with Markdown-formatted output designed for LLM consumption.

Available tools include:
- **VIN decoding** — comprehensive vehicle specifications (year, make, model, engine, dimensions, colors, equipment)
- **License plate decoding** — converts plate to VIN, then fetches full specs
- **Vehicle history reports** — accident history, title information, odometer readings
- **Recall information** — safety recalls by VIN
- **Market value estimates** — current market pricing
- **OBD code lookup** — diagnostic trouble code descriptions
- **Vehicle image search** — stock and real photos
- **OCR plate recognition** — decode plates from images with confidence scores and bounding boxes

A remote variant (carsxe/carsxe-remote-mcp-server) is also available for cloud deployment. The API requires a CarsXE API key.

This is valuable for automotive agents that need to identify, value, or assess vehicles without direct OBD-II access — useful for dealers, insurance adjusters, fleet purchasers, and aftermarket researchers.


## EV Charging

### MCP EV Assistant Server

**mcp_ev_assistant_server** (GitHub: Abiorh001/mcp_ev_assistant_server, Python) provides tools for managing EV charging stations and trip planning:

- **Charge Station Locator** — finds nearby charging stations using the OpenChargeMap API
- **EV Trip Planner** — plans routes with charging stops using Google Maps API

The server requires OpenChargeMap and Google Maps API keys. While focused on the consumer use case (finding chargers and planning trips), it demonstrates how MCP can bridge the gap between AI agents and charging infrastructure.

The broader EV charging ecosystem — OCPP-based charge point management systems, smart charging schedulers, fleet charging optimization — remains unrepresented in the MCP landscape. Projects like CitrineOS (open-source OCPP 2.0.1 CSMS) and the mobilityhouse OCPP Python library provide the underlying protocol support, but no MCP servers yet wrap these for AI agent access.


## Automotive Cybersecurity Compliance

### Automotive-MCP: R155, R156, and ISO 21434

**Automotive-MCP** (GitHub: Ansvar-Systems/Automotive-MCP, npm: @ansvar/automotive-cybersecurity-mcp, Apache-2.0) enables AI assistants to access and reason about automotive cybersecurity requirements. It uses a read-only SQLite database with full-text search (FTS5) for fast, accurate access to regulatory content.

Regulatory sources covered:
- **UNECE R155** — cybersecurity management system requirements for vehicle type approval (mandatory in EU, Japan, South Korea, and expanding)
- **UNECE R156** — software update management system requirements
- **ISO/SAE 21434** — road vehicle cybersecurity engineering standard

Key capabilities:
- **87 bidirectional R155 ↔ ISO 21434 cross-mappings** — essential because R155 defines what you must have (CSMS, processes, documentation) while ISO 21434 defines how to build it
- **ISO 21434 work products tool** — requirements by clause and phase
- **Global standards coverage** — VDA TISAX, SAE J3061, AUTOSAR security modules (SecOC, CSM, KeyM, IdsM — 12 modules total), Chinese GB/T standards
- **Full-text search** across all regulatory content

Everything runs locally with no network calls, no telemetry, and no data collection — important for organizations working with pre-release vehicle security assessments.

This server fills a genuine compliance need. Automotive cybersecurity regulations are new (R155 enforcement began July 2024 for new vehicle types), complex (spanning multiple standards bodies), and critical (failure means vehicles cannot receive type approval). An AI agent that can cross-reference R155 requirements against ISO 21434 work products while checking AUTOSAR security module compliance saves significant manual effort.

From the same publisher, the EU_Compliance_MCP server provides broader access to 37 EU regulations that may intersect with automotive work (GDPR for connected car data, NIS2 for critical infrastructure, Cyber Resilience Act for software components).


## Maps, Navigation, and Routing

While not automotive-specific, mapping and navigation MCP servers are essential components of any automotive AI system. Several official implementations exist:

**TomTom MCP** (GitHub: tomtom-international/tomtom-mcp, official) provides location services, search, routing, and real-time traffic data — directly relevant to fleet routing, delivery optimization, and navigation assistance.

**Mapbox MCP** (GitHub: mapbox/mcp-server, official, 325 stars) offers geocoding, routing, and map rendering through Mapbox's platform.

**HERE Maps MCP** (GitHub: limingchina/heremaps-mcp-server, community) exposes geocoding, reverse geocoding, places search, routing, traffic, and map rendering from HERE's platform — a major supplier to automotive OEMs.

**Baidu Maps MCP** (GitHub: baidu-maps/mcp, official, 415 stars) provides mapping services particularly relevant for the Chinese automotive market.

**Google Maps MCP** (multiple implementations, 236+ stars) offers directions, places, geocoding, and traffic data.

These mapping servers become automotive-relevant when combined with vehicle data: "Route my fleet's EVs to avoid construction zones, stopping at compatible fast chargers where battery state of charge will drop below 20%."


## Connected Car Platforms and MCP-over-MQTT

### EMQX: MCP over MQTT for Vehicles

EMQX, the leading open-source MQTT broker, has pioneered the integration of MCP with MQTT for connected vehicle applications. Their MCP-over-MQTT architecture addresses a fundamental challenge: vehicles in the field communicate primarily via MQTT, while AI agents communicate primarily via MCP. Bridging these protocols enables AI agents to interact with vehicles in real time.

The vehicle-cloud collaborative architecture processes data at both the edge (in-vehicle) and the cloud:
- **Edge processing** reduces data transmission costs and improves latency for real-time decisions
- **Cloud processing** enables fleet-wide analytics and model training
- **MCP tools** at both layers allow AI agents to orchestrate data flow

Production deployments include fleets of 250,000+ vehicles processing 50,000 messages per second. Major automotive manufacturers including SAIC Volkswagen, Lotus, and Geely use EMQX for connected vehicle platforms.

EMQX also supports MQTT over QUIC, which they position as important for connected cars in 2026: improved connection resumption for vehicles moving between cellular towers, reduced handshake overhead, and better performance on unreliable networks.

### Smartcar API (No MCP Server Yet)

Smartcar provides a unified REST API supporting 40+ vehicle brands including Tesla, Ford, BMW, Hyundai, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and others. Their API covers location, odometer, fuel/battery level, tire pressure, lock/unlock, and charging management.

No MCP server wraps the Smartcar API today. This represents a significant opportunity: a single MCP server could provide AI agents with access to vehicles from dozens of manufacturers through one standardized interface. The Smartcar API already handles the OEM-specific authentication and data normalization that makes cross-brand vehicle access possible.


## Comprehensive Automobile MCP Project

A Medium article documents a comprehensive Automobile MCP project — a diagnostic simulation platform providing tools for simulating real-world vehicle scenarios, generating authentic diagnostic data, and facilitating automotive system analysis through MCP. While primarily a proof-of-concept, it demonstrates the breadth of automotive MCP applications: sensor simulation, fault injection, diagnostic workflows, and multi-system coordination.

## Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: AI Vehicle Diagnostic Assistant

    └────────┘ └────────┘ └──────────┘
```

An AI agent receives a symptom description ("car shudders when accelerating above 60 mph"), queries OBD-II diagnostic codes through MCP-CAN, looks up the vehicle's recall history and specifications through CarsXE, checks whether the fault relates to any known cybersecurity issues through Automotive-MCP, and synthesizes a diagnostic report with recommended actions.

### Pattern 2: Tesla Fleet Intelligence Dashboard

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

    └────────────┘ └─────────┘ └───────────┘
```

A fleet manager asks: "Which of our vehicles need charging before tomorrow's deliveries, and where should they charge tonight?" The agent queries TeslaMate for current battery levels and historical consumption patterns, checks available routes and charging stations through mapping MCP servers, and if vehicles are at depot, initiates charging through the Fleet API — all through standard MCP tool calls.

### Pattern 3: Connected Car Edge-Cloud Pipeline

```

EMQX's MCP-over-MQTT bridges vehicle telemetry streams with AI agent reasoning. Edge processing in each vehicle handles real-time decisions (driver behavior analysis, anomaly detection), while cloud-side MCP tools aggregate fleet data, correlate with external sources (weather, traffic, vehicle specs), and generate actionable insights. This architecture processes driving behavior analysis locally for privacy, only sending aggregated reports to the cloud when the driver consents.

```

A cybersecurity engineer preparing for R155 type approval asks: "Show me all R155 requirements related to over-the-air updates and map them to ISO 21434 work products we need to produce." The agent queries Automotive-MCP for R155 requirements on software updates, uses the 87 cross-mappings to identify corresponding ISO 21434 clauses, checks EU Compliance MCP for intersecting GDPR and Cyber Resilience Act requirements, and generates a compliance checklist with document templates.


## Security, Safety, and Privacy Considerations

Automotive MCP integrations raise unique security and safety concerns that go beyond typical software systems.

**Vehicle safety is life-critical.** Unlike most MCP use cases, automotive commands can affect physical safety. Unlocking a vehicle, starting charging, or modifying climate controls are low-risk. But any future MCP integration with driving functions — steering, braking, acceleration — would be safety-critical. The mcp-teslamate-fleet server's approach of requiring explicit confirmation for sensitive commands and rate-limiting all commands to 40/day is a reasonable pattern for current capabilities.

**OBD-II access is powerful.** The CAN bus carries messages between all vehicle ECUs. An MCP server with CAN bus access could theoretically send messages to any system on the bus — not just read diagnostic data. MCP-CAN's virtual CAN approach (no hardware by default) is safer for development, but any production deployment connecting MCP to real vehicle networks must implement strict message filtering, read-only modes by default, and authentication at the hardware level.

**Connected car data is sensitive.** Vehicle telemetry reveals precise location history, driving patterns, home and work addresses, daily routines, and travel habits. EMQX's edge-processing approach — analyzing driving behavior on-vehicle rather than streaming raw data to the cloud — reflects growing awareness of these privacy implications. GDPR applies to connected car data in the EU, and vehicle data privacy regulations are expanding globally.

**Fleet API credentials carry broad access.** Tesla Fleet API tokens can wake vehicles, unlock doors, and initiate charging. These credentials must be treated with the same care as production database credentials. MCP servers wrapping fleet APIs should support credential rotation, scope-limited tokens, audit logging, and the principle of least privilege.

**Cybersecurity compliance data may be sensitive.** Organizations preparing for R155 type approval work with threat analyses, vulnerability assessments, and security architectures that reveal vehicle attack surfaces. While Automotive-MCP runs locally with no network calls, organizations should consider data handling policies for AI-generated compliance artifacts.

**API deprecation and protocol evolution.** Tesla's deprecation of REST API command endpoints in favor of the Vehicle Command Protocol illustrates a broader challenge: automotive APIs evolve, and MCP servers must track these changes. Relying on deprecated endpoints creates both functionality and security risks.


## Platform Landscape

### Tesla: The API-First Outlier

Tesla is unique among major automakers in providing a comprehensive Fleet API accessible to third-party developers. The Fleet Telemetry system allows vehicles to stream data directly to owner-operated servers, eliminating polling. This openness has enabled the richest MCP ecosystem of any OEM — three separate implementations covering analytics, control, and the combined case.

However, Tesla's recent move from REST API to the Vehicle Command Protocol for sensitive operations signals a tightening of direct vehicle control access. The MCP ecosystem will need to adapt to this protocol evolution.

### EMQX: Bridging IoT and AI Protocols

EMQX's MCP-over-MQTT initiative is the most significant infrastructure development for connected car AI. By encapsulating MCP's tool-calling within MQTT's lightweight transport, EMQX enables AI agents to interact with vehicle hardware through the same protocol stack vehicles already use for telematics. Production deployments with SAIC Volkswagen, Lotus, and Geely demonstrate enterprise-scale viability. Their MQTT-over-QUIC support addresses the specific challenges of automotive connectivity — frequent handoffs between cellular towers, unreliable rural coverage, and the need for rapid connection resumption.

### BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen: SDV Investment, Closed APIs

The major German OEMs are investing heavily in software-defined vehicles:
- **BMW's Neue Klasse** (launching 2026) features a "SuperBrain" ECU hierarchy and Operating System X, developed in-house
- **Mercedes-Benz's MBUX** integrates AI from both Microsoft and Google in its fourth-generation infotainment platform
- **Volkswagen** invested up to $5.8 billion in a joint venture with Rivian after persistent delays from its in-house software unit Cariad

None of these OEMs offer public APIs comparable to Tesla's Fleet API, and none have announced MCP support. Their AI strategies focus on in-vehicle assistants (proprietary) rather than third-party agent access. The Smartcar API provides limited standardized access to some functions across these brands, but no MCP server wraps it.

### Stellantis and Toyota: Platform Partnerships

Stellantis's STLA Brain creates a central computing architecture across vehicle classes, while Toyota uses AI for autonomous driving, predictive maintenance, and smart factories. Both rely on supplier partnerships rather than in-house software stacks. Neither offers third-party API access that would enable MCP integration.

### Ansvar Systems: Compliance Tooling Pioneer

Ansvar Systems has created the only dedicated automotive MCP server (Automotive-MCP), plus related servers for EU compliance, US compliance, Swedish law, German law, Polish law, sanctions, and security controls. This positions them as the leading provider of regulatory MCP infrastructure — relevant across automotive, but also for any industry facing complex compliance requirements.

### Tier-1 Suppliers: No MCP Presence

Major tier-1 automotive suppliers — Bosch, Continental, ZF, Denso, Magna — have no MCP servers. These companies control much of the automotive software supply chain (ECU software, sensor fusion, ADAS algorithms) but have not yet engaged with the MCP ecosystem. Given that tier-1 suppliers increasingly offer software platforms (Bosch's Vehicle Computer, Continental's Body HPC), MCP integration at this level could open significant capabilities for AI agents.


## Ecosystem Gaps

The automotive MCP ecosystem has notable coverage in vehicle diagnostics, Tesla integration, and cybersecurity compliance, but massive gaps remain across the broader industry.

**Autonomous driving simulation.** CARLA (12,800+ stars), LGSVL, and Waymo's simulation tools have no MCP servers. An AI agent that could configure simulation scenarios, analyze results, and iterate on autonomous driving algorithms through MCP would accelerate development workflows significantly.

**AUTOSAR tooling.** AUTOSAR Classic and Adaptive platforms define the software architecture for most production vehicles, but no MCP servers exist for AUTOSAR configuration, code generation, or analysis. The SOME/IP middleware, DDS communication, and adaptive platform service management all lack MCP interfaces.

**Dealership management systems (DMS).** CDK Global, Reynolds and Reynolds, and Dealertrack manage inventory, sales, service, and parts for most car dealerships. No MCP servers exist for any DMS platform. An AI agent that could query inventory, schedule service appointments, and generate customer communications through a DMS would transform dealership operations.

**Fleet telematics platforms.** Geotab, Samsara, Verizon Connect, and CalAmp serve millions of fleet vehicles but have no MCP servers. These platforms hold the richest real-time vehicle data outside of OEM APIs — GPS, engine diagnostics, driver behavior, fuel consumption, maintenance alerts — all locked behind proprietary APIs.

**Insurance telematics.** Usage-based insurance (UBI) programs collect driving data to price risk, but no MCP server bridges telematics data with insurance underwriting systems. See our [MCP and Insurance guide](/guides/mcp-insurance/) for the broader insurance gap.

**OEM APIs beyond Tesla.** BMW Connected Drive, Mercedes me connect, FordPass, GM OnStar, Hyundai Bluelink, and Toyota Connected Services all provide vehicle data to their respective apps — but none offer the kind of developer-accessible API that enables MCP integration. The Smartcar API provides partial standardized access, but without an MCP wrapper.

**Charging network management.** ChargePoint, EVgo, Electrify America, and Tesla Supercharger networks have no MCP servers. The OCPP protocol for charge point management lacks an MCP bridge. Fleet charging optimization — scheduling vehicles to charge at off-peak rates across multiple depots — is a natural AI agent use case with no MCP tooling.

**Vehicle-to-everything (V2X).** V2X communication (vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure) is expanding for safety and traffic optimization. No MCP servers exist for V2X message handling, traffic signal priority, or cooperative driving scenarios.

**Automotive supply chain.** Parts ordering, supplier management, production scheduling, and logistics for automotive manufacturing have no MCP representation. This connects to the broader [MCP and Supply Chain/Logistics](/guides/mcp-supply-chain-logistics/) gap.


## Getting Started

### For automotive software engineers
Start with **MCP-CAN** to understand how vehicle diagnostic data flows through MCP. The virtual CAN bus eliminates the need for hardware. Progress to **Embedded-MCP-ELM327** if you want to explore hardware-level MCP integration with a real OBD-II dongle.

### For Tesla owners and fleet operators
**teslamate-mcp** (103 stars) is the most mature option. Install TeslaMate first to accumulate vehicle data, then connect the MCP server to query your data through Claude or another MCP client. Add **mcp-teslamate-fleet** if you want live vehicle control alongside analytics.

### For compliance engineers
**Automotive-MCP** runs locally with no network calls — install it via npm and start querying R155/R156/ISO 21434 requirements immediately. The 87 cross-framework mappings between R155 and ISO 21434 are particularly valuable for type approval preparation.

### For fleet managers
Combine **CarsXE MCP** for vehicle identification and data lookup with mapping MCP servers (**TomTom**, **Mapbox**, or **Google Maps**) for route optimization. If managing a Tesla fleet, add the Tesla MCP stack for direct vehicle integration.

### For EV charging operators
**mcp_ev_assistant_server** provides a starting point for station location and trip planning. The broader OCPP ecosystem (CitrineOS, mobilityhouse/ocpp) provides protocol support that could be wrapped in MCP for more comprehensive charging management.

### For connected car platform developers
Explore **EMQX's MCP-over-MQTT** documentation for the most production-ready approach to bridging vehicle telemetry with AI agents. Their architecture supports both edge and cloud processing, handles 250,000+ vehicle fleets, and integrates with existing MQTT infrastructure.


## Market Context

The automotive AI market is projected to grow from $15 billion in 2026 to $52 billion by 2034, a 16.7% CAGR. The automotive AI agents market specifically is valued at $4.2 billion in 2026, projected to reach $11.7 billion by 2036, with autonomous driving agents holding a 45% share.

Connected car deployments are expected to reach 125 million vehicles in 2026. The autonomous vehicles market is valued at $69.5 billion in 2026, growing to $103.8 billion by 2033. Software-defined vehicle platforms are projected to generate $755 billion in hardware revenue by 2029, with feature-related revenue growing at 30-34% CAGR through 2035.

45% of OEMs now classify SDVs as their top strategic priority, surpassing autonomous driving. Development cycles are compressing from 48-60 months to 24-36 months. Asia Pacific dominates with 56.7% of the automotive AI market in 2025.

These numbers suggest that automotive MCP servers — particularly those bridging AI agents with vehicle data, fleet management, and compliance systems — are addressing a market with enormous growth potential. The current gap between Tesla's API openness and every other OEM's closed ecosystem represents both the biggest opportunity and the biggest obstacle for the MCP automotive ecosystem.
