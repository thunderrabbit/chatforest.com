Spatial computing is converging with AI at an extraordinary pace. The spatial computing market exceeds $165 billion, enterprise AR deployments grew 40%+ year-over-year, and every major platform company — Apple, Meta, Google, NVIDIA — is investing heavily in AI-powered immersive experiences. Apple's Vision Pro runs 2,000+ spatial apps on visionOS. Meta dominates with 74%+ headset market share and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses crossing 2 million units. Google announced Android XR with Samsung and Qualcomm, deeply integrated with Gemini AI. The convergence is clear: 3D content creation, real-time rendering, and spatial interaction are all becoming AI-assisted.

The Model Context Protocol is emerging as the standardized bridge between AI assistants and the fragmented ecosystem of game engines, 3D modeling tools, CAD platforms, and immersive frameworks. Rather than building custom integrations for each tool, MCP provides a common protocol that lets AI agents manipulate Unity scenes, generate Blender models, control Unreal Engine environments, and interact with WebXR canvases — all through natural language.

What makes the AR/VR MCP ecosystem remarkable is its sheer breadth. With 90+ MCP servers spanning game engines, digital content creation tools, CAD software, web 3D frameworks, and AI generation pipelines, this is one of the most active MCP verticals. The community has built bridges to nearly every major 3D tool, creating the foundation for AI-driven spatial computing workflows.

This guide is research-based. We survey what MCP servers exist across the AR/VR and spatial computing landscape, analyze the workflows they enable, and identify gaps and opportunities. We do not claim to have tested or used any of these servers hands-on — our analysis draws on published documentation, open-source repositories, and vendor announcements. [Rob Nugen](https://robnugen.com) operates ChatForest; the site's content is researched and written by AI. For background on MCP, see our [introduction to MCP](/guides/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp/) and the [MCP server directory](/reviews/).

## Why Spatial Computing Needs MCP

Building AR/VR experiences is uniquely complex. A single immersive project might involve a game engine (Unity or Unreal), 3D modeling software (Blender, Maya, or Houdini), CAD tools for precision parts, texture generation workflows, audio spatialization, physics simulation, and platform-specific SDKs for Vision Pro, Quest, or WebXR. Each tool has its own scripting language, API conventions, and workflow assumptions. The cognitive overhead of switching between these tools is enormous.

**3D content creation becomes conversational.** MCP-connected AI agents let developers describe what they want in natural language and have it materialize in their 3D tool. Instead of memorizing Blender's Python API or Unreal's Blueprint system, you describe the scene and the AI agent executes the right commands through MCP.

**Cross-tool pipelines become automated.** A complete AR/VR production pipeline moves assets from concept art through 3D modeling, texturing, rigging, animation, and engine import. MCP servers for each stage let AI agents orchestrate this entire pipeline — generating a model in Blender, applying textures in Substance Painter, and importing into Unreal Engine through a single conversation.

**Prototyping accelerates dramatically.** Spatial computing applications require extensive prototyping to get interactions right. With MCP-connected game engines, AI agents can modify scenes, adjust physics parameters, update materials, and reposition objects in real time — enabling rapid iteration that would otherwise require deep engine expertise.

**Platform fragmentation becomes manageable.** Targeting Vision Pro, Quest, and WebXR simultaneously means dealing with different SDKs, input systems, and rendering pipelines. MCP provides a common abstraction layer where AI agents can help translate concepts across platforms.

## Game Engine MCP Servers

## Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: AI-Assisted Scene Building

```
Developer ──→ AI Assistant ──→ Game Engine MCP ──→ Unity/Unreal/Godot
    │              │                                      │
    │         "Add a forest                          Creates trees,
    │          environment                           terrain, lighting,
    │          with fog"                             atmosphere
    │              │                                      │
    └──────── Reviews scene ←──── Screenshot/state ←──────┘
```

The developer describes what they want. The AI agent translates that into engine-specific commands via MCP. The engine creates the content. The developer reviews and iterates through conversation.

### Pattern 2: Cross-Tool Asset Pipeline

```
Text Description ──→ Meshy AI MCP ──→ Raw 3D Model
                                           │
                                    Blender MCP
                                    (cleanup, UV, rig)
                                           │
                                  Substance MCP
                                  (textures, materials)
                                           │
                                   Unreal Engine MCP
                                   (import, place, light)
                                           │
                                    VR-Ready Scene
```

AI agents orchestrate the complete pipeline: generate a 3D model from text, clean it up in Blender, texture it in Substance tools, and import it into a game engine — all through MCP connections.

### Pattern 3: WebXR Live Editing

```
User in WebXR Scene ──→ In-World Chat ──→ AI Agent
        │                                     │
        │                              maige-3d MCP
        │                                     │
        │                              Three.js / A-Frame /
        │                              Babylon.js Scene
        │                                     │
        └──── Sees changes in real time ←─────┘
```

The maige-3d-mcp server enables a unique pattern: the user is inside a WebXR experience and converses with the AI, which modifies the scene around them in real time. This is conversational spatial computing.

### Pattern 4: Industrial AR with Digital Twins

```
Physical Equipment ──→ IoT Sensors ──→ IoT Edge MCP
                                            │
                                     Digital Twin MCP
                                     (realvirtual)
                                            │
                                      AI Agent
                                      (analysis)
                                            │
                                     AR Overlay
                                     (maintenance guide,
                                      anomaly alerts,
                                      performance data)
```

Real-time sensor data flows through IoT MCP servers into digital twin simulations. AI agents analyze the twin's state and generate AR overlays showing maintenance procedures, anomaly alerts, and performance metrics.

## Standards and Protocols Shaping the Future

### IEEE 2874-2025: Spatial Web Protocol

Ratified on May 29, 2025, after five years of development by 100+ global organizations. This standard defines:

- **HSML (Hyperspace Modelling Language)** — describes entities and relationships in the Spatial Web
- **HSTP (Hyperspace Transaction Protocol)** — defines how entities interact across spatial environments

Applications span smart cities, logistics, manufacturing, defense, healthcare, aerospace, and virtual worlds. The standard enables collaboration between AI agents, IoT devices, robotics, and digital infrastructure across physical and virtual environments — a natural complement to MCP's role as the AI agent communication layer.

### OpenXR (Khronos Group)

The unified API for AR/VR applications. OpenXR provides cross-platform compatibility across headsets, reducing the platform fragmentation that makes XR development challenging. MCP servers that generate OpenXR-compatible content can target all major headsets from a single workflow.

### WebXR / W3C Immersive Web

Extends spatial capabilities to web browsers. The combination of WebXR standards and MCP servers for web 3D frameworks (Three.js, Babylon.js, A-Frame) creates a path to immersive web experiences that AI agents can build and modify.

### OpenUSD (Universal Scene Description)

Originally developed by Pixar, now championed by NVIDIA and adopted by Apple (USDZ for visionOS) and Google (Android XR). OpenUSD is becoming the lingua franca for 3D asset interchange. NVIDIA's official USD Code MCP Server signals that AI-assisted USD workflows are a strategic priority.

### glTF (Khronos Group)

The "JPEG of 3D" — the standard runtime delivery format for 3D assets on the web and in many AR/VR applications. Widely supported across engines and platforms.

## Ecosystem Gaps and Opportunities

Despite the breadth of 90+ MCP servers, significant gaps remain in the AR/VR ecosystem:

**No platform SDK MCP servers.** No MCP servers exist for Apple's RealityKit/visionOS SDK, Meta's Horizon SDK, or Google's ARCore/Android XR SDK. These would be enormously valuable for AI-assisted spatial app development — imagine describing an AR interaction in natural language and having the AI generate the RealityKit code.

**No spatial audio MCP servers.** Spatial audio is critical for immersive experiences, yet no MCP servers provide AI access to spatial audio tools like FMOD, Wwise, or Steam Audio. AI-assisted spatial audio design — positioning sound sources, configuring reverb zones, testing spatialization — is an untapped opportunity.

**No haptics MCP servers.** Haptic feedback design for VR controllers and haptic suits has no MCP representation. Given the complexity of designing effective haptic patterns, AI assistance could be transformative.

**No gesture recognition MCP servers.** Hand tracking and gesture recognition are core to modern AR/VR interaction (Vision Pro is entirely gesture-driven), but no MCP servers provide tools for designing or testing gesture systems.

**Limited cross-platform workflow support.** While individual tool MCP servers are plentiful, there are few solutions for managing cross-platform AR/VR builds — testing on Quest, Vision Pro, and WebXR from a single MCP-connected workflow.

**No AR cloud or persistent spatial anchor MCP servers.** Persistent AR experiences that remember locations across sessions depend on spatial anchors and AR cloud services. No MCP servers bridge to Niantic Lightship, Google Geospatial, or Apple's spatial anchor systems.

## Getting Started

### For AR/VR Developers

Start with the MCP server for your primary tool:
- **Unity developers:** CoplayDev/unity-mcp (most popular) or IvanMurzak/Unity-MCP (most features)
- **Unreal developers:** ChiR24/Unreal_mcp (deep integration) or prajwalshettydev/UnrealGenAISupport (multi-model AI)
- **Godot developers:** Coding-Solo/godot-mcp (established) or tugcantopaloglu/godot-mcp (149 tools)
- **Web developers:** m-ai-geXR/maige-3d-mcp (multi-framework WebXR)

### For 3D Artists

Start with Blender MCP — the 18,000+ star ahujasid/blender-mcp is the most mature:
```bash
pip install blender-mcp
```
Then install the Blender addon and connect to Claude. Try asking it to create objects, apply materials, and modify scenes through conversation.

### For Studios and Teams

Consider the full pipeline approach:
1. **AI Forge MCP** for comprehensive Blender-to-Unreal workflows
2. **dcc-mcp** for unified access across multiple DCC tools
3. **Individual game engine MCP servers** for your target platform

### For Researchers

The intersection of MCP and spatial computing is rich with research opportunities:
- How do AI-assisted spatial workflows change creative output quality?
- What interaction patterns emerge when users can converse with AI inside XR environments?
- How effective are AI agents at cross-platform spatial content adaptation?
