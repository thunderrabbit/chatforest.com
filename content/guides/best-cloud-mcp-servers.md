The three major cloud providers have all shipped MCP servers. Each took a fundamentally different approach — and the architecture matters more than the feature list.

AWS built 68 separate servers in a monorepo. Google Cloud built 18 managed remote endpoints. Microsoft built one unified server covering 47+ services. Same problem, three philosophies.

We've reviewed all three: [AWS MCP Servers](/reviews/aws-mcp-servers/) (4/5), [Google Cloud MCP Servers](/reviews/google-cloud-mcp-servers/) (4/5), and [Azure MCP Servers](/reviews/azure-mcp-servers/) (4/5). Here's how they compare head-to-head.

## At a Glance

| | AWS | Google Cloud | Azure |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** | 68 separate local servers + managed remote preview | 18 managed remote endpoints + 15+ open-source | 1 unified server (47+ services) + 16 specialized |
| **GitHub** | [awslabs/mcp](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp) | [google/mcp](https://github.com/google/mcp) | [microsoft/mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp) |
| **Stars** | 8,500 | 3,400 (+ 13,500 for Toolbox) | 2,800 |
| **Transport** | stdio (local) + streamable HTTP (preview) | HTTP (managed) + stdio (open-source) | stdio (local only) |
| **Auth** | AWS credentials (IAM) | Google Cloud ADC | Entra ID + RBAC |
| **Language** | Python (primary) | Go, Python, TypeScript | C# / .NET (primary) |
| **License** | Apache 2.0 | Apache 2.0 | MIT |
| **Rating** | 4/5 | 4/5 | 4/5 |

All three scored 4/5 in our reviews. The differences are in philosophy, not quality.

## Three Architectures, Three Trade-offs

### AWS: The Server-Per-Service Model

AWS built a server for everything. S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, ECS, CDK, Bedrock, CloudWatch, Cost Explorer — each gets its own MCP server with purpose-built tools. The Core MCP Server acts as an orchestrator, choosing which servers to activate based on role-based configurations.

**Strengths:**
- Deepest per-service coverage — each server is purpose-built with comprehensive tooling
- The Core server's role-based profiles (DevOps, Data, ML) reduce configuration noise
- 8,500 stars and 190+ releases — the largest community by far
- Managed remote endpoint (`mcp.global.api.aws`) combines API access + knowledge + Agent SOPs

**Trade-offs:**
- Configuration complexity scales with services — using 10 AWS services means configuring 10 servers
- Local-first architecture requires Node.js/Python runtime on the agent's machine
- 68 servers means 68 things to keep updated

### Google Cloud: The Managed Endpoint Model

Google took the opposite approach. Instead of shipping servers you run locally, they host MCP endpoints on `googleapis.com`. Your agent connects over HTTPS, authenticates with Google Cloud credentials, and queries the service. No local binaries, no Docker, no runtime dependencies.

**Strengths:**
- No local installation — connect to an HTTPS endpoint and go
- Server runs next to the data (lower latency, no egress for internal queries)
- The right architecture for production agent deployments
- The 13,500-star MCP Toolbox for Databases is battle-tested (v0.30.0, connection pooling, OpenTelemetry)

**Trade-offs:**
- 16 of 18 managed servers are still Preview — no SLA, potential breaking changes
- 18 separate endpoints means 18 separate configurations
- Documentation is scattered across multiple Google Cloud pages
- Open-source servers lag behind managed ones in quality

### Azure: The Unified Server Model

Microsoft built one binary — the Azure MCP Server — that covers 47+ services through filterable namespaces. Instead of deciding which servers to install, you install one server and configure which namespaces to enable.

**Strengths:**
- One server, one install, 47+ services — minimal configuration overhead
- Built into Visual Studio 2026 with zero setup
- Tool annotations (destructive/readOnly/secret) enable smart safety checks
- Three package managers (npm, NuGet, pip) match your existing toolchain
- Best practices tools for architecture guidance (not just CRUD)

**Trade-offs:**
- Some services are shallow (list-only, no deep management)
- No managed remote option yet — local stdio only
- The broader Microsoft stack (DevOps, Fabric, M365) is still 16+ separate servers
- Lowest community adoption (2,800 stars)

| **Container registry** | ECR server | — | ACR namespace |

**Winner: AWS + Azure** — AWS for native tooling, Azure DevOps for the platform

## Setup Complexity

**Easiest to start:** Google Cloud (managed endpoints — just point your client at a URL)

**Easiest to scale:** Azure (one server handles 47+ services — add namespaces, not servers)

**Most configuration needed:** AWS (each service is a separate server to install and configure)

### Quick Setup Comparison

**AWS** — install per server, authenticate with AWS credentials:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aws-core": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.core-mcp-server@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Google Cloud** — connect to managed endpoint:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bigquery": {
      "url": "https://bigquery.googleapis.com/mcp/sse",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Azure** — one install, enable namespaces:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "azure": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@azure/mcp@latest", "server", "start"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Which One Should You Use?

This is straightforward: **use the MCP servers for the cloud you're already on.**

Cloud MCP servers are deeply integrated with their provider's authentication, APIs, and service architecture. They're not portable — an AWS MCP server is useless if your infrastructure runs on Google Cloud.

### Use AWS MCP Servers if:
- Your infrastructure runs on AWS
- You need deep per-service tooling (68 specialized servers)
- You want the largest community (8,500 stars, 190+ releases)
- You're comfortable managing multiple servers per project

### Use Google Cloud MCP Servers if:
- Your infrastructure runs on Google Cloud
- You want managed remote endpoints (no local installation)
- You need the MCP Toolbox for Databases (13.5K stars, production-proven)
- You're building production agents that shouldn't run servers locally

### Use Azure MCP Servers if:
- Your infrastructure runs on Azure
- You want one unified server instead of managing dozens
- You're in the Microsoft ecosystem (VS 2026, .NET, Entra ID)
- You need enterprise security features (tool annotations, read-only mode)

### Multi-Cloud?

If you run infrastructure across multiple clouds, you'll need MCP servers from each provider. The good news: they can coexist in your MCP client configuration. The bad news: there's no unified multi-cloud MCP server yet.

For multi-cloud database access specifically, consider [Google's MCP Toolbox for Databases](https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox) — despite the Google branding, it supports self-managed databases alongside Google Cloud ones.

## The Architecture Question

The most interesting difference isn't feature coverage — it's the transport model.

**Local servers** (AWS's primary approach, Azure) run on your machine. They're fast for development, work offline, and give you full control. But they require runtime dependencies, updates, and don't scale to production agent architectures where the agent and the data might be in different regions.

**Managed remote servers** (Google Cloud's approach, AWS's preview endpoint) run in the cloud. They eliminate local dependencies, live next to the data, and scale naturally. But they require network connectivity, add latency for non-cloud queries, and mean trusting the provider with your MCP traffic.

The industry is moving toward remote. AWS's managed endpoint preview and Azure DevOps's remote server preview both signal that local-only won't be the long-term model. Google was early on this bet.
