You've written unit tests for your MCP server's tool handlers. You've got integration tests that run through `InMemoryTransport`. Good — that's the foundation. But MCP servers fail in ways that unit tests don't catch: schemas drift silently between releases, tool outputs change shape under load, and security vulnerabilities hide in input handling that "looks fine" in dev.

This cookbook picks up where our [MCP testing strategies guide](/guides/mcp-testing-strategies/) leaves off. Each recipe solves a specific testing problem with a specific tool. Our analysis draws on published documentation, open-source repositories, and community benchmarks — we research and analyze rather than building production MCP systems ourselves.

## Recipe 1: Schema Drift Detection with Bellwether

**Problem:** You ship a new version and a downstream client breaks because a tool parameter changed from `required` to `optional` — or disappeared entirely. Nobody noticed because all existing tests still passed.

**Tool:** [Bellwether](https://github.com/dotsetlabs/bellwether) — a schema drift detector that compares your MCP server's current tool/resource definitions against a known baseline.

Bellwether has two modes:
- **`check`** — free, deterministic, compares schemas structurally
- **`explore`** — LLM-powered, tests tool behavior for regressions

It classifies changes by severity (0–4) and exits with the corresponding code, making it CI-friendly.

**GitHub Actions integration:**

```yaml
- uses: dotsetlabs/bellwether@v2.1.3
  with:
    server-command: "node dist/server.js"
    fail-on-severity: 2  # Fail on warnings and above
```

**When to use it:** Every PR that touches tool definitions, resource URIs, or prompt templates. Run in `check` mode on every commit; run `explore` mode on release candidates.

## Recipe 2: Record/Replay Testing with MCPSpec

**Problem:** You want regression tests but writing them by hand is tedious. You also need mock servers for client testing, and you don't want to maintain them separately.

**Tool:** [MCPSpec](https://github.com/light-handle/mcpspec) — records interactive MCP sessions, replays them against new versions with granular diffs, and generates standalone mock server files.

MCPSpec's workflow:

1. **Record** a session against your live server
2. **Replay** the recording against a new version — MCPSpec highlights exactly what changed
3. **Mock** — generate a standalone JavaScript mock file (requires only `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`) for client tests

It also includes quality scoring (0–100 across 5 dimensions) and a security audit with 8 vulnerability rules.

**When to use it:** When you're maintaining a server that clients depend on and need to guarantee backward compatibility. The generated mocks are particularly valuable — they let client developers test without running your server or needing API keys.

## Recipe 3: Auto-Generated Tests with Specmatic

**Problem:** You have 35+ tools and writing test cases for each one is impractical.

**Tool:** [Specmatic MCP Auto-Test](https://specmatic.io/) — reads your MCP server's tool schemas and automatically generates test calls with valid parameters.

Key features:
- Generates tests from tool schemas automatically — no hand-written test cases
- Uses dictionary files for realistic test data (e.g., actual city names instead of random strings)
- **Resiliency testing** — mutates enum values and optional fields to verify your server handles edge cases gracefully
- Tested against Postman's MCP server: 35+ tools in a single run

**When to use it:** Large servers with many tools where hand-writing tests is impractical. Especially useful as a smoke test — it won't verify business logic, but it catches crashes, schema violations, and missing error handling across your entire tool surface.

## Recipe 4: Protocol Compliance with mcp-validator

**Problem:** Your server works with Claude Desktop but breaks with Cursor. Or it works with the 2024-11-05 spec but fails on 2025-03-26 features.

**Tool:** [mcp-validator](https://github.com/Janix-ai/mcp-validator) — a Python-based protocol compliance test suite that verifies your server against specific MCP spec versions.

Supports protocol versions:
- 2024-11-05
- 2025-03-26
- 2025-06-18

Tests include OAuth 2.1 flows, batch processing, structured output (`outputSchema`), and HTTP compliance (7/7 standard checks).

**When to use it:** Before releasing a server that claims spec compliance. Run it against each protocol version you want to support.

## Recipe 5: Fuzzing with mcp-server-fuzzer

**Problem:** Your server handles normal inputs fine but crashes on malformed requests, oversized payloads, or unexpected types. You won't find these bugs through happy-path testing.

**Tool:** [mcp-server-fuzzer](https://github.com/Agent-Hellboy/mcp-server-fuzzer) — a Hypothesis-based fuzzer that generates both realistic and adversarial inputs for MCP servers.

Two-phase approach:
1. **Realistic phase** — generates valid-looking requests to test normal code paths
2. **Aggressive phase** — sends malformed inputs, wrong types, oversized payloads

Three modes:
- `tools` — fuzzes tool arguments
- `protocol` — fuzzes MCP message structures
- `all` — both

Supports HTTP, SSE, stdio, and Streamable HTTP transports. Includes a safety system with filesystem sandboxing and command filtering.

```bash
# Docker
docker pull princekrroshan01/mcp-fuzzer:latest

# Or install directly
pip install mcp-server-fuzzer
mcp-fuzzer --mode all --transport stdio -- python my_server.py
```

**When to use it:** Before any public release. Fuzzing consistently finds bugs that deterministic tests miss — especially input validation gaps, crash-inducing edge cases, and buffer/memory issues.

## Recipe 6: Static Analysis and Security Audit with MCPLint

**Problem:** You want to check for security vulnerabilities (injection, SSRF, tool poisoning) without running the server.

**Tool:** [MCPLint](https://github.com/quanticsoul4772/mcplint) — a Rust-based linter with 56 validation rules across 7 categories.

Categories:
- **Protocol** — message format, JSON-RPC compliance
- **Schema** — parameter types, required fields, descriptions
- **Sequence** — initialization order, capability negotiation
- **Tool** — naming conventions, annotation completeness
- **Resource** — URI format, MIME types
- **Security** — 20+ rules for injection, SSRF, tool poisoning, rug-pull detection
- **Edge Cases** — boundary conditions, empty inputs

Output formats: `json`, `sarif` (GitHub Code Scanning), `junit`, `gitlab` (Code Quality), `html`.

```bash
mcplint check ./my-server --format sarif > results.sarif
# Or fuzz mode with coverage-guided testing
mcplint fuzz ./my-server --duration 300 --workers 4
```

**When to use it:** On every commit. The `sarif` output integrates directly with GitHub's Code Scanning alerts, so security issues show up as PR annotations.

## Recipe 7: Contract Testing with mcpdiff

**Problem:** You need to know whether a change to your MCP server is breaking, a warning, or safe — before it reaches production.

**Tool:** mcpdiff — stores contract snapshots as `.mcpc.json` files in git and classifies changes.

Change classifications:
- **Breaking** — removed tools, changed required parameters, narrowed types
- **Warning** — new required parameters, changed defaults
- **Safe** — added tools, added optional parameters, expanded types

```bash
# Capture baseline
mcpdiff snapshot --server "node dist/server.js" > baseline.mcpc.json

# Compare against new version
mcpdiff diff baseline.mcpc.json --server "node dist/server-v2.js"

# CI mode: exit codes + GitHub step summaries
mcpdiff ci --baseline baseline.mcpc.json --server "node dist/server-v2.js"
```

**When to use it:** In your CI pipeline on every PR. Commit the `.mcpc.json` baseline to git. Breaking changes should fail the build unless explicitly approved.

## Recipe 8: Pytest Assertions with pytest-mcp

**Problem:** You want MCP-specific test assertions that go beyond "did the tool return something?"

**Tool:** [pytest-mcp](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mcp/) — a pytest plugin with MCP-aware assertions and automatic metrics collection.

Available assertions:
- `tool_was_called()` — verify a tool was invoked
- `tool_arguments_match()` — verify the arguments passed to a tool
- `cost_under()` — verify the operation stayed within a cost budget
- `objective_succeeded()` — LLM-as-judge evaluation of whether the tool achieved its goal

```python
def test_search_tool(mcp_session):
    result = mcp_session.call_tool("search", {"query": "MCP servers"})
    assert mcp_session.tool_was_called("search")
    assert mcp_session.tool_arguments_match({"query": "MCP servers"})
    assert mcp_session.cost_under(0.01)
```

**When to use it:** When you want richer assertions than raw output comparison — especially the `cost_under()` assertion for tools that call paid APIs, and `objective_succeeded()` for evaluating subjective tool quality.

## Recipe 9: Container-Based E2E Testing with Testcontainers

**Problem:** Your server depends on external services (databases, APIs) and you want reproducible E2E tests without mocking.

**Pattern:** Run your MCP server in a Docker container using [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/) and communicate via JSON-RPC over the container's attached socket.

```python
from testcontainers.core.container import DockerContainer
from testcontainers.core.waiting_utils import wait_for_logs

def test_server_e2e():
    with DockerContainer("my-mcp-server:latest") \
            .with_kwargs(stdin_open=True, tty=False) as container:
        wait_for_logs(container, "MCP server started", timeout=60)
        socket = container.get_wrapped_container().attach_socket(
            params={"stdin": True, "stdout": True, "stream": True}
        )
        # Send initialization request
        socket.sendall(encode_mcp_message({
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",
            "method": "initialize",
            "params": {"capabilities": {}},
            "id": 1
        }))
        response = read_mcp_response(socket)
        assert response["result"]["protocolVersion"]
```

This pattern comes from [Arm's learning path on MCP testing](https://learn.arm.com/learning-paths/cross-platform/automate-mcp-with-testcontainers/). It works across architectures (arm64 + x86_64) and integrates with CI/CD via GitHub Actions matrix strategies.

**When to use it:** When your server has external dependencies that are hard to mock (databases, file systems, network services) and you want true isolation without the flakiness of mocking.

## Recipe 10: Performance Benchmarking

**Problem:** Your server works fine in development but falls over under concurrent load. You need to know your throughput ceiling before production.

**What the benchmarks show:**

[TM Dev Lab's benchmark](https://www.tmdevlab.com/mcp-server-performance-benchmark-v2.html) tested 15 MCP servers with 39.9M total requests:

| Runtime | Avg Latency | Throughput | Memory |
|---------|-------------|------------|--------|
| Go | < 1ms | 1600+ req/sec | ~18 MB |
| Java | < 1ms | 1600+ req/sec | ~220 MB |
| Python | ~26ms | ~292 req/sec | Moderate |

[Stacklok's Kubernetes testing](https://dev.to/stacklok/performance-testing-mcp-servers-in-kubernetes-transport-choice-is-the-make-or-break-decision-for-1ffb) revealed that **transport choice matters more than you think**:

- **stdio in Kubernetes:** Only 2/50 requests succeeded — "unsuitable for production"
- **Streamable HTTP (shared sessions):** 299.85 req/sec at 200 connections
- **Streamable HTTP (unique sessions):** ~30 req/sec — a **10x performance difference** from shared sessions

**How to benchmark your server:**

1. Use a simple echo tool to isolate transport overhead from business logic
2. Test with concurrent connections (10, 50, 100, 200)
3. Measure: requests/sec, p50/p95/p99 latency, error rate, memory usage
4. Test both shared and unique session patterns if using HTTP transport
5. Run the same benchmark after code changes to catch regressions

## Putting It Together: A CI Pipeline

Here's how these recipes compose into a CI pipeline:

```
PR opened
  ├── MCPLint static analysis (every commit)
  ├── Unit tests with pytest-mcp assertions (every commit)
  ├── Bellwether schema drift check (every commit)
  ├── mcpdiff contract comparison (every commit)
  └── mcp-validator protocol compliance (release branches)

Release candidate
  ├── mcp-server-fuzzer (aggressive mode)
  ├── MCPSpec replay regression tests
  ├── Testcontainers E2E tests
  ├── Performance benchmark (compare against baseline)
  └── Bellwether explore mode (LLM-powered)
```

Not every project needs all of these. Start with what matches your pain points:

- **Schema keeps drifting?** → Bellwether + mcpdiff
- **Client compatibility issues?** → mcp-validator + MCPSpec
- **Security concerns?** → MCPLint + mcp-server-fuzzer
- **Performance questions?** → Benchmark with realistic concurrency
- **Too many tools to test manually?** → Specmatic auto-test
