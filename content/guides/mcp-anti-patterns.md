MCP servers are everywhere. Every week, new ones launch for databases, cloud platforms, SaaS tools, and developer infrastructure. But quantity doesn't mean quality. An Endor Labs study of 2,614 MCP implementations found that 82% use filesystem operations vulnerable to path traversal, 67% are susceptible to code injection, and 34% are prone to command injection. AgentSeal's scan of 1,808 servers found 66% had at least one security finding.

Many of these problems come from the same recurring mistakes. This guide covers the 12 anti-patterns we see most often — in tool design, security, architecture, and operations — with concrete fixes for each.

## Anti-Pattern 1: Wrapping Every API Endpoint as a Tool

This is the single most common MCP design mistake. Developers take an existing REST API and expose each endpoint as a separate MCP tool. A CRM integration ends up with `get_customer_by_email`, `list_customer_orders`, `get_order_status`, `get_shipping_details` — forcing the AI to chain four calls in the right sequence just to answer "where's my order?"

**Why it's a problem:**

- Benchmarks show tool selection accuracy drops logarithmically as tool count increases
- GitHub Copilot cut from 40 tools to 13 and saw measurable improvement
- Block rebuilt its Linear MCP server three times, ultimately going from 30+ tools to just 2
- Every additional tool description competes for space in the context window

**What to do instead:**

Design tools around user tasks, not API endpoints. One tool called `track_order(email)` that internally calls all four APIs and returns "Order #12345 shipped via FedEx, arriving Thursday" is better than four tools the agent has to orchestrate. Think outcome-oriented, not endpoint-oriented.

## Anti-Pattern 2: Vague or Missing Tool Descriptions

Tool descriptions are how AI agents decide which tool to call. If the description is generic — "Manages customer data" — the agent has to guess. If two tools have overlapping descriptions, the agent picks the wrong one unpredictably.

**Real impact:**

When tools have vague descriptions, agents skip them entirely and attempt workarounds, or they call the wrong tool and waste tokens on retries. This is the number one reason agents call the wrong tool in production.

**What to do instead:**

- Write descriptions that match user language: "Look up a customer's current order status by their email address" beats "Customer order management endpoint"
- Include what the tool returns, not just what it does
- Mention constraints: "Only works for orders placed in the last 90 days"
- If two tools sound similar, make the distinction explicit in both descriptions

## Anti-Pattern 3: No Input Validation

The Anthropic Git MCP server — the official reference implementation — had three CVEs (CVE-2025-68143, CVE-2025-68144, CVE-2025-68145) from constructing shell commands with unsanitized user input. If the official implementation gets this wrong, your server probably does too.

**The pattern that causes this:**

```python
# DON'T: String concatenation with user input
result = subprocess.run(f"git log --oneline {branch_name}", shell=True)

# DO: Use parameterized calls
result = subprocess.run(["git", "log", "--oneline", branch_name])
```

**The fix:**

- Never construct shell commands from tool arguments using string concatenation or template strings
- Use parameterized subprocess calls, ORM queries, or API client libraries
- Validate and sanitize every input — treat all tool arguments as untrusted
- Apply the same rigor you'd apply to a public-facing web API

## Anti-Pattern 4: Overly Permissive File System Access

Teams frequently grant MCP servers broad filesystem access during development — "let me just point it at `/` so I can test" — and then ship that configuration to production. This turns every prompt injection vulnerability into a full filesystem traversal.

**The numbers:** 82% of MCP implementations use filesystem operations vulnerable to path traversal (Endor Labs, 2026).

**What to do instead:**

- Restrict access to specific directories. If your server needs to read project files, mount only the project directory
- Allowlist file extensions when possible
- Use chroot, containers, or filesystem sandboxes for production deployments
- Deny access to dotfiles and configuration directories (`.env`, `.ssh`, `.git/config`) by default

## Anti-Pattern 5: Token Passthrough Without Validation

A surprisingly common pattern: the MCP server receives an authentication token from the client and passes it straight through to a downstream API without checking whether that token was actually issued for the MCP server's use.

**Why it's dangerous:**

- A compromised or malicious MCP client can pass stolen tokens from other services
- The downstream API sees a valid token and grants access, even though the MCP server was never the intended audience
- There's no audit trail showing that authorization was properly delegated

**What to do instead:**

- Validate that tokens are issued specifically for your MCP server (check the `aud` claim)
- Use OAuth 2.1 with proper audience restriction — this is now the MCP spec recommendation
- Never pass user tokens through unchanged; exchange them or use service-level credentials with scoped permissions

## Anti-Pattern 6: Printing Debug Output to stdout

With stdio transport, stdout IS the protocol channel. Any `print()`, `console.log()`, or logging library output that hits stdout gets mixed into the JSON-RPC message stream and breaks the client.

This is one of the most frustrating bugs to diagnose because the server appears to work in isolation but fails when connected to a real client.

**What to do instead:**

- Send all logs to stderr (`sys.stderr` in Python, `console.error()` in Node.js)
- Configure your logging framework to use stderr explicitly
- Use a dedicated log file or structured logging service for production
- Test with a real MCP client, not just direct HTTP calls

## Anti-Pattern 7: No Write-Operation Safety Net

AI agents are non-deterministic. They sometimes misinterpret intent, hallucinate arguments, or chain tools in unexpected ways. If your MCP server can create, update, or delete records, every one of those operations is a potential unintended side effect.

**Examples from the wild:**

- An agent asked to "clean up the test data" that deleted production records
- A tool call with a hallucinated email address that sent real messages to real people
- An agent that "helpfully" modified database schemas it was only supposed to query

**What to do instead:**

- Implement confirmation flows for destructive operations — return a preview and require explicit confirmation before executing
- Use read-only modes by default; require explicit opt-in for write access
- Add dry-run capabilities: show what would happen before doing it
- Log every write operation with full context (who triggered it, what arguments, what the agent's reasoning was)

## Anti-Pattern 8: Context Window Bloat

MCP servers that return large, unstructured data dumps — entire database tables, full API responses, complete file contents — consume context window space that the agent needs for reasoning. When the context fills up, the agent's performance degrades across all tasks, not just the one that triggered the large response.

**What to do instead:**

- Return summaries with the option to drill down, not raw data dumps
- Paginate results and let the agent request more if needed
- Filter and format responses for the agent's actual task — a 50-row table is rarely better than the 3 rows that match the query
- Set reasonable response size limits and truncate with a "results truncated, use filters to narrow" message

## Anti-Pattern 9: No Error Context for Self-Correction

Traditional APIs return error codes for machines. MCP tools return errors for AI agents — which means the error message is an instruction. A bare `400 Bad Request` tells the agent nothing. A message like "Parameter `date` must be in ISO 8601 format (e.g., 2026-04-04), but received 'next Thursday'" tells it exactly how to fix the call.

**What to do instead:**

- Write error messages as if you're teaching the agent what went wrong and what to try next
- If tool B requires calling tool A first, say so explicitly in the error: "You need to call `authenticate` before calling `query_data`"
- Include valid parameter examples in validation errors
- For rate limits, include when the agent can retry

## Anti-Pattern 10: Running Everything as Admin

MCP servers frequently run with the same permissions as the user who installed them — which often means full admin access. This violates least privilege and turns any vulnerability into a maximum-impact exploit.

**What to do instead:**

- Run MCP servers under dedicated service accounts with minimal permissions
- Use database roles that only have SELECT on the tables the server needs
- Scope API tokens to the specific operations the server performs
- Use container isolation so even if the server is compromised, lateral movement is limited

## Anti-Pattern 11: Ignoring the Supply Chain

Most MCP servers are installed from npm or pip with a `npx` or `uvx` command. The supply chain between "I want to use this tool" and "this code is running on my machine" has no verification step.

**The reality:**

- There's no official MCP server registry with security audits
- Package names can be typosquatted
- Transitive dependencies bring in code you've never reviewed
- A compromised dependency executes in the context of the MCP server's permissions — which includes whatever APIs and filesystems the server can reach

**What to do instead:**

- Pin dependency versions; don't use `latest`
- Audit the dependency tree before installation, not after
- Use lockfiles and verify checksums
- Prefer MCP servers from known organizations with established security practices
- Run servers in sandboxed environments (containers, VMs) so a supply chain compromise doesn't mean full host access

## Anti-Pattern 12: No Observability

You can't secure what you can't see. Many MCP server deployments have no logging, no metrics, and no way to answer "what did the agent do last Tuesday?" When something goes wrong — and it will — you're debugging blind.

**What to do instead:**

- Log every tool call with timestamp, arguments, caller identity, and result summary
- Track error rates and latency per tool — a spike in errors often signals prompt injection attempts or misuse
- Implement audit trails for sensitive operations (data access, write operations, authentication events)
- Set up alerts for anomalous patterns: unusual tool call sequences, high error rates, access to unexpected resources

## How Many of These Apply to You?

If you're evaluating an MCP server, check it against this list. Most open-source MCP servers hit at least 3-4 of these anti-patterns. Enterprise servers typically do better on security (#3, #4, #5, #10) but worse on tool design (#1, #2, #8).

If you're building an MCP server, the highest-impact fixes are:

1. **Reduce tool count** (#1) — this has the most measurable effect on agent accuracy
2. **Write good descriptions** (#2) — cheap to fix, high impact
3. **Validate inputs** (#3) — non-negotiable for anything touching shell, SQL, or filesystem
4. **Add observability** (#12) — you'll need it the moment something goes wrong
