The events industry is enormous and growing. Projected to reach $1.55 trillion globally by 2028, events are no longer side activities — they are core revenue drivers, brand experiences, and community hubs for organizations of every size. Event management software alone is a $9.3–12.2 billion market in 2025, heading toward $34.7 billion by 2029 at a 17.4% CAGR. Virtual events, which surged during the pandemic and then consolidated into hybrid models, represent a market of $98–136 billion. And 65% of corporate events now adopt hybrid formats as the default, not the exception.

Yet event professionals still juggle an astonishing number of disconnected tools. A single conference might involve Eventbrite or Cvent for registration, Google Calendar or Outlook for scheduling, Zoom or Teams for virtual sessions, Mailchimp or ActiveCampaign for email campaigns, Stripe for payment processing, Slido for live polling, a mobile app for attendee networking, and spreadsheets for everything else. A large event can touch 15–20 different platforms before a single attendee walks through the door.

MCP — the Model Context Protocol — provides a standardized way for AI agents to connect to these fragmented event tools. Rather than building custom integrations for each ticketing platform, calendar service, video conferencing tool, or email marketing system, MCP-connected agents can manage registrations, schedule sessions, coordinate speakers, send targeted communications, and analyze attendee engagement through defined tool interfaces. The protocol transforms AI assistants from isolated chatbots into operational event management tools that work across the entire event lifecycle — from initial planning and promotion through day-of execution and post-event analysis. For an introduction to MCP itself, see our [introduction to MCP](/guides/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp/).

The event management MCP ecosystem is uneven. Calendar and scheduling servers are remarkably mature, with Google Calendar alone having 10+ implementations led by a dominant 1,100-star server. Video conferencing and meeting intelligence are well-covered too. But core event platforms — Cvent, Bizzabo, Hopin, virtual event tools, venue management, attendee engagement — have almost zero MCP presence. The opportunity for integration is massive; the tooling is just beginning to emerge.

This guide is research-based. We survey what MCP servers exist across the event management landscape, analyze the architecture patterns they enable, and identify where significant gaps remain. We do not claim to have tested or used any of these servers hands-on — our analysis draws on published documentation, open-source repositories, vendor announcements, and industry research.

## Why Event Management Needs MCP

Event operations present integration challenges that MCP is architecturally well-suited to address.

**Event planning is a multi-platform coordination problem.** A single event requires coordinating across registration, scheduling, communication, venue logistics, speaker management, and attendee engagement — typically handled by 10–20 different tools. AI agents with MCP access across these platforms could orchestrate the entire event lifecycle through a single conversational interface, eliminating the manual copy-paste workflows that consume event planners' time.

**Personalization demands real-time data integration.** Attendees increasingly expect personalized experiences — curated session recommendations, relevant networking matches, targeted communications. Bizzabo reports a 25% increase in session engagement when AI recommendations align with behavior-based preferences. Delivering this requires connecting attendee profiles, registration data, session schedules, and engagement signals in real time. MCP-connected agents could query across these data sources to deliver personalization that isolated tools cannot.

**Hybrid events multiply coordination complexity.** With 65% of corporate events adopting hybrid formats, organizers must simultaneously manage physical venues, virtual platforms, live streaming, on-demand content, and cross-format networking. Each component has its own tools and data. MCP servers bridging physical event systems, virtual platforms, and streaming infrastructure could let AI agents ensure consistent experiences across formats.

**Event marketing requires rapid iteration.** Eventbrite reports a 63% increase in ticket sales for creators using AI promotional tools and 30% shorter campaign development cycles. But this requires connecting event data (registration counts, ticket tiers, speaker confirmations) with marketing tools (email campaigns, social media, ad platforms) and analytics. MCP-connected agents that span event and marketing platforms could automate data-driven promotional workflows.

**Post-event analysis is scattered and manual.** Event ROI measurement requires combining registration data, attendance tracking, session engagement, survey responses, social media mentions, and revenue figures — typically exported from multiple platforms into spreadsheets. AI agents with MCP access to event, survey, and analytics platforms could provide real-time ROI dashboards and automated post-event reporting.

## Ticketing and Event Platforms

The core event management platforms are where events are created, tickets are sold, and registrations are managed. MCP coverage here is community-driven, with no major event platform offering an official MCP server.

### Ticketmaster MCP Server — Live Event Discovery

**delorenj/mcp-server-ticketmaster** | 24 stars | TypeScript

According to repository documentation, this server connects to the Ticketmaster Discovery API to provide event, venue, and attraction search with keyword, date, and location filtering. It returns dual output (structured JSON and formatted text), including pricing information and direct ticket URLs. With 16 commits, it is the most mature ticketing MCP implementation. Two additional community implementations exist: mochow13/ticketmaster-mcp-server (1 star, TypeScript, streamable HTTP transport) and mmmaaatttttt/mcp-live-events (2 stars, Python, focused on live music events).

### Eventbrite MCP Servers — Event Lifecycle Management

PCI DSS 4.0 compliance is handled at the platform level.

## Architecture Patterns for AI-Powered Event Management

The MCP servers in the event ecosystem can be composed into powerful multi-tool architectures. Here are four patterns that demonstrate how AI agents can orchestrate event operations.

### Pattern 1: AI Event Orchestrator

An AI agent that manages the complete event lifecycle through a unified conversational interface.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│         │                 │                │       │
│  ┌──────┴───────┐  ┌──────┴───────┐  ┌─────┴─────┐ │
│  │ActiveCampaign│  │    Zoom      │  │  Teams    │ │
│  │  MCP Server  │  │  MCP Server  │  │   MCP     │ │
│  │  (marketing) │  │  (virtual)   │  │  Server   │ │
│  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └───────────┘ │
│                                                     │
│  Agent Workflow:                                    │
│  1. Create event + ticket tiers (Eventbrite)       │
│  2. Block calendar dates for organizers (Calendar)  │
│  3. Set up virtual component (Zoom)                │
│  4. Configure payment processing (Stripe)          │
│  5. Launch email campaign (ActiveCampaign)         │
│  6. Coordinate team via Teams channels             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This pattern eliminates the manual context-switching that event planners do across 10+ platforms. The AI agent holds the full event context — attendee count targets, budget constraints, timeline — and executes across tools accordingly.

### Pattern 2: Hybrid Event Coordinator

An AI agent that ensures consistent experiences across physical and virtual event components.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            Hybrid Event Coordinator Agent            │

│  │ (scheduling) │       │  └──────────────────┘    │
│  └──────────────┘       │                          │
│                         │                          │
│  ┌──────────────────────┴──────────────────────┐   │
│  │         Unified Attendee Data Layer          │   │
│  │  ActiveCampaign MCP    │   HubSpot MCP      │   │
│  │  (engagement tracking) │   (contact sync)   │   │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│                                                     │
│  Agent ensures:                                     │
│  • Session links sync between calendar + Zoom      │
│  • Attendance tracked across both formats           │
│  • Recordings/transcripts available post-session    │
│  • Follow-up campaigns target by attendance mode    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

With 65% of corporate events now hybrid, this pattern addresses a real operational pain point. The AI agent bridges the physical-virtual divide that typically requires manual reconciliation.

### Pattern 3: Intelligent Event Marketing Engine

An AI agent that optimizes event promotion through data-driven campaign orchestration.

```

│                                                     │
│  Agent Workflow:                                    │
│  1. Analyze registration pace vs targets           │
│  2. Segment audience by engagement + past events    │
│  3. Trigger campaigns: early-bird → urgency →      │
│     last-chance based on registration velocity      │
│  4. Track conversions and adjust messaging          │
│  5. Report ROI: revenue vs marketing spend         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Eventbrite reports 63% higher ticket sales with AI promotional tools. This pattern connects event data with marketing execution, enabling closed-loop optimization that manual workflows cannot achieve.

### Pattern 4: Post-Event Intelligence Agent

An AI agent that automates post-event analysis, follow-up, and knowledge capture.

```

Post-event analysis is where most organizations lose momentum. This pattern captures value that typically evaporates — turning raw attendance data, session recordings, and engagement signals into actionable follow-up within hours instead of weeks.

## Ecosystem Gaps: What Is Missing

The event management MCP ecosystem has massive gaps despite strong calendar and video coverage.

### Event Planning Platforms — Zero Official MCP Servers

No major event planning platform has released an official MCP server:

- **Cvent** — market leader in enterprise events, no MCP
- **Bizzabo** — Gartner Leader two consecutive years, no MCP
- **Splash** — popular for branded event experiences, no MCP
- **Hopin** — virtual event pioneer, no MCP
- **vFairs** — 3D virtual event environments, no MCP
- **Airmeet** — virtual networking events, no MCP

This is the single biggest gap. These platforms hold the core event data — registrations, agendas, speakers, sponsors, exhibitors — that AI agents need to orchestrate events effectively.

### Virtual Event Platforms — No Dedicated MCP Servers

While Zoom and Teams have meeting-focused MCP servers, dedicated virtual event platforms have zero presence:

- **Zoom Events** (distinct from Zoom Meetings) — no dedicated MCP
- **ON24** — webinar platform, no MCP
- **Demio** — no MCP
- **Livestorm** — no MCP
- **BigMarker** — no MCP
- **GoTo Webinar** — no MCP
- **Webex Events** — no MCP

Virtual event platforms offer features beyond basic video — virtual booths, breakout rooms, expo halls, networking lounges — none of which are accessible through MCP today.

### Attendee Engagement — Complete Void

No MCP servers exist for the tools that drive attendee interaction:

- **Slido** (polling and Q&A, owned by Cisco) — no MCP
- **Mentimeter** — no MCP
- **Pigeonhole Live** — no MCP
- No networking/matchmaking MCP servers exist
- No gamification MCP servers exist

### Venue Management — Zero Coverage

The physical logistics side of events has no MCP presence whatsoever:

- **Tripleseat** — no MCP
- **Event Temple** — no MCP
- **Momentus (Ungerboeck)** — no MCP
- No venue booking, availability, or floor plan MCP servers exist
- No catering management MCP servers exist

### Conference Management — No Coverage

Specialized conference tools for managing speakers, sessions, and programs:

- **Whova** — no MCP
- **Sched** — no MCP
- **Sessionize** — no MCP (speaker/session management)
- No abstract submission or peer review MCP servers exist

### Secondary Ticketing — Limited

- **StubHub** — no MCP
- **Live Nation** (parent of Ticketmaster) — no official MCP
- **Dice** — no MCP
- **Universe** — no MCP
- **Tito** — no MCP

## Regulatory and Practical Considerations

AI-assisted event management operates under several regulatory frameworks that event professionals must understand.

### Data Privacy: GDPR and CCPA

Privacy regulations apply based on **where the attendee resides**, not where the event is held. A European attendee purchasing a ticket to a US conference triggers GDPR obligations. A Californian registering for a European event triggers CCPA/CPRA requirements. Key requirements:

- **Consent**: Clear opt-in consent required (no pre-ticked boxes under GDPR). AI processing of attendee data for personalization requires explicit transparency about what data is collected and how it is used.
- **Data minimization**: Collect only what is necessary for the event. MCP-connected agents accessing multiple platforms must be configured to request only required data fields.
- **Right to deletion**: Attendees can request complete data removal. AI systems using MCP to sync attendee data across platforms must support coordinated deletion.
- **Automated decisions**: GDPR restricts solely automated decisions that significantly affect individuals. AI-driven ticket pricing, access control, or networking recommendations may trigger this provision.

### Accessibility: ADA and WCAG

A critical and evolving regulatory area:

- **April 24, 2026 deadline**: Public entities in areas with 50,000+ population must comply with ADA Title II requiring WCAG 2.1 Level AA for web and video content, including live and recorded events.
- **April 26, 2027**: Smaller entities must comply.
- **European Accessibility Act**: Effective June 2025, requiring accessible digital services across EU member states aligned with WCAG 2.1 AA.
- **Practical implications**: Real-time captioning, ASL interpretation, accessible registration forms, multiple participation modes, and accessible mobile apps. Auto-generated captions often fail to meet professional accuracy standards required by WCAG.

AI agents managing events through MCP should be configured to check accessibility requirements as part of event setup — verifying captioning is enabled, registration forms are accessible, and alternative participation modes are available.

### Payment Compliance: PCI DSS 4.0

PCI DSS 4.0 changes became mandatory on March 31, 2025. For event ticketing:

- Continuous risk analysis required (not just annual assessments)
- Stronger authentication requirements
- Secure hosted payment fields, tokenization, and point-to-point encryption
- Stripe's official MCP server provides a compliant pathway by handling card data at the platform level, but event organizers remain responsible for their overall PCI scope

### Health and Safety

The UK's Martyn's Law (Terrorism Protection of Premises Act 2025) requires vulnerability assessments, hostile threat response training, and attack emergency plans for event venues. The US NFPA 3000 addresses active shooter preparedness. Venue capacity is governed by local fire and building codes — exceeding legal occupancy triggers fines and permit revocation.

AI-powered crowd management systems using real-time density and flow data are gaining adoption in 2025–2026, with documented intervention protocols becoming standard practice.

## Getting Started by Role

### For Event Planners and Coordinators

Start with calendar integration — nspady/google-calendar-mcp (1,100 stars) or the CalDAV server for platform-agnostic scheduling. Add Eventbrite MCP for ticketing management. The combination of calendar + ticketing covers the most common daily workflows: scheduling events, managing registrations, and coordinating team availability.

### For Event Marketing Managers

Begin with ActiveCampaign's official MCP server for email campaign automation, or HubSpot's official MCP for combined CRM and marketing. Connect to Eventbrite MCP for registration data to drive segmented campaigns. The closed loop between event data and marketing execution is where AI agents deliver the most immediate value.

### For Virtual and Hybrid Event Producers

Start with Zoom MCP for session management and Meeting-BaaS or tl;dv for cross-platform meeting intelligence. Add Google Calendar MCP for session scheduling. The gap in dedicated virtual event platform MCP servers means current capabilities center on the video conferencing layer rather than full virtual event features.

### For Conference Organizers

The ecosystem has significant gaps here. Use The Events Calendar MCP (official) if running on WordPress. Combine with Google Calendar for speaker scheduling, Zoom for virtual sessions, and ActiveCampaign for attendee communications. Watch for future MCP servers from Whova, Sched, or Sessionize.

### For Venue and Operations Managers

The MCP ecosystem currently has no venue management servers. Focus on calendar MCP servers for booking coordination and Teams MCP for operational communication. This is a space where custom MCP servers connecting to venue management systems would deliver significant value.

### For Developers Building Event Tech

The event MCP space has enormous gaps to fill. High-impact server opportunities include: Cvent or Bizzabo API wrappers, venue availability checkers, attendee engagement (polling/Q&A), check-in systems, and floor plan/seating management. The Events Calendar's official MCP server provides a good reference implementation for vendor-backed event MCP development. See our [guide to building MCP servers](/guides/build-your-first-mcp-server/) for technical foundations.

## What Comes Next

The event management MCP ecosystem is at an early but promising stage. Calendar and scheduling integration is remarkably mature — the 1,100-star Google Calendar MCP server rivals the best in any MCP category. Video conferencing and meeting intelligence are well-served. Email marketing has multiple official vendor MCP servers.

But the core of event management — the platforms where events are actually planned, ticketed, and experienced — remains almost entirely disconnected from MCP. No major event planning platform (Cvent, Bizzabo, Splash), no virtual event platform (Hopin, vFairs, ON24), no attendee engagement tool (Slido, Mentimeter), and no venue management system has an MCP server.

The market dynamics suggest this will change. With 95% of surveyed event teams expecting AI usage to increase in 2026 (Bizzabo), and the event software market growing at 17.4% CAGR, the demand for AI-connected event tools is clear. When event platforms begin adopting MCP, AI agents will be able to orchestrate the complete event lifecycle — from initial concept through post-event analysis — through a single interface.

For now, the practical approach is to compose the available tools: strong calendar integration as the scheduling backbone, video conferencing for session delivery, email marketing for attendee communication, and payment processing for revenue — building event AI workflows from the outside in while waiting for the core platforms to join the ecosystem.
