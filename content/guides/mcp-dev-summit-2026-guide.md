The first MCP Dev Summit North America took place April 2–3, 2026 in New York City, organized by the [Agentic AI Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-the-formation-of-the-agentic-ai-foundation) (AAIF) under the Linux Foundation. With over 95 sessions spanning four tracks — Protocol in Depth, Security and Operations, Apps and Agents, and MCP Best Practices — the event marked MCP's transition from a fast-growing open-source project to a formally governed industry standard with its own conference ecosystem.

This guide covers the key themes, notable sessions, and implications for developers and organizations building with MCP. Our analysis draws on the published schedule, speaker announcements, and pre-summit commentary — we research and analyze rather than attending events hands-on.

## 1. The Five Major Themes

Across 95+ sessions, five themes dominated the summit agenda:

### Theme 1: Cross-Platform Interoperability

The most symbolically important keynote was **"MCP x MCP"** by **Nick Cooper** (OpenAI). OpenAI's presence at an MCP conference — presenting on cross-ecosystem compatibility — underscores how thoroughly MCP has won the protocol wars. Both OpenAI's and Anthropic's SDKs recently added resource listing and reading capabilities, suggesting the two largest AI providers are converging on shared MCP primitives.

**Ania Musial** (Bloomberg) reinforced this with **"Interoperability and Trustworthy AI Infrastructure"**, framing MCP as the integration layer that financial institutions need for multi-vendor AI deployments.

### Theme 2: SDK V2 and Protocol Evolution

**Max Isbey** (Anthropic) presented **"Path to V2 for MCP SDKs"**, one of the most anticipated sessions. The Python SDK had been frozen at v1.26.0 since January 2026 while TypeScript continued releasing updates — a divergence that frustrated Python developers. The V2 roadmap is expected to address authentication architecture changes, better type safety, and more consistent cross-language behavior.

**Paul Carleton** (Anthropic) and **Den Delimarsky** (Anthropic) presented complementary sessions on conformance testing ("One Spec, Ten SDKs, Zero Excuses") and client ID metadata documents, both critical for ensuring the growing number of SDK implementations behave consistently.

### Theme 3: Security as a First-Class Concern

Security was the single largest track, with 23 sessions dedicated to MCP security and operations. This reflects the ecosystem's maturation — with 30+ CVEs filed in early 2026 and research showing 5.5% of public servers affected by tool poisoning, security has moved from afterthought to top priority.

Key security sessions included:

- **"Mix-Up Attacks in MCP: Multi-Issuer Confusion and Mitigations"** — Emily Lauber (Microsoft)
- **"MCPwned: Hacking MCP Servers"** — Jonathan Leitschuh (Independent Security Researcher)
- **"The Boring Attack That Will Actually Get You"** — Craig Jellick (Obot AI)
- **"Beyond the Sandbox: Security at Host Layer"** — Lorenzo Verna & Pietro Valfrè (Denied)
- **"Threat Modeling Authorization"** — Sarah Cecchetti (OpenID Foundation)
- **"Securing the MCP Ecosystem"** — Lisa Tagliaferri & Trevor Dunlap (Chainguard)

Six sessions focused specifically on authentication, with **Aaron Parecki** (OAuth 2.1 specification author) and **Paul Carleton** (Anthropic) addressing the fragmented auth landscape. STDIO servers currently lack authentication entirely, and HTTP servers handle it inconsistently — a problem the summit aimed to align the community around solving.

### Theme 4: Enterprise Production Patterns

Multiple sessions addressed the gap between MCP demos and production deployments:

- **"Duolingo's AI Slackbot: An Enterprise Assistant With 180+ MCP Tools"** — Aaron Wang (Duolingo) shared how Duolingo built an internal AI assistant using MCP to help employees find answers, triage alerts, debug incidents, and navigate internal systems across 180+ integrated tools.
- **"One-To-Many: Enabling MCP, Agents, and Intelligent Systems"** — Ola Hungerford & Sandeep Bhat (Nordstrom) discussed scaling MCP across a large retail organization.
- **"From One MCP Server To an Ecosystem"** — Vaibhav Tupe (Equinix) covered the journey from a single server to an organizational ecosystem.
- **"Human in the Loop, Agent in the Flow"** — Harald Kirschner & Connor Peet (Microsoft) addressed the critical question of human oversight in agentic MCP workflows.
- **"From 60 Minutes To 60 Seconds: Healthcare Billing"** — Andrew Espira (Kustode) demonstrated MCP's impact on healthcare automation.

### Theme 5: Infrastructure and Gateway Patterns

As MCP deployments grow, infrastructure patterns are emerging:

- **"Building a Unified Control Plane for MCP"** — Cecilia Liu (Docker) presented Docker's approach to MCP server management and distribution.
- **"The MCP Gateway Pattern"** — Juan Antonio Osorio (Stacklok) covered gateway architectures for routing, security, and observability.
- **"Distributing MCP Servers With OCI"** — Bobby House (Docker) addressed packaging MCP servers as OCI containers.
- **"Solving Context Bloat"** — Hugo Guerrero & Deirdre Anderson (Kong) tackled the practical challenge of context window management.
- **"Interceptors for MCP"** — Kurt Degiorgio & Cannis Chan (Bloomberg) discussed middleware patterns for enterprise MCP deployments.
- **"Kubernetes-Native Agent Discovery"** — Carlos Santana (AWS) covered service discovery for MCP in container orchestration environments.

## 2. Notable Keynotes

### "MCP Apps: Extending the Frontier"
**Ido Salomon** (Creator, MCP-UI) and **Liad Yosef** (Co-creator, MCP Apps)

Opened the summit by framing MCP beyond server-side tool integration — as a foundation for entirely new application paradigms where AI agents interact with rich user interfaces.

### "Context is More Than Tools"
**Ryan Cooke** (Engineering Lead, WorkOS)

Challenged the common perception that MCP is "just" a tool-calling protocol, arguing that the context primitives (resources, prompts, sampling) are equally important for building production-grade AI systems.

### "Using MCP for Skills Orchestration"
**Jacob Wilson** (Principal, GenAI Transformation, PwC)

Brought a consulting/enterprise perspective on using MCP to orchestrate complex multi-step agent workflows — framing MCP tools as composable "skills" rather than isolated function calls.

## 3. What This Means for the Ecosystem

### MCP Has Institutional Legitimacy Now

A 95-session conference with Diamond sponsors (AWS, Docker), keynotes from both Anthropic and OpenAI, and sessions from Bloomberg, Nordstrom, PagerDuty, and Duolingo removes any remaining doubt about MCP's staying power. This isn't a developer experiment anymore — it's enterprise infrastructure.

### Security Will Define the Next Phase

The disproportionate focus on security (23 of 95+ sessions) signals that the ecosystem recognizes its biggest vulnerability. The transition from "connect everything" to "connect everything securely" is the defining challenge for 2026's second half. Authentication standardization, in particular, is overdue.

### The Python SDK Needs Parity

The frozen Python SDK was a repeated concern in pre-summit commentary. With Python being the dominant language for AI/ML workflows, the V2 SDK roadmap is critical for maintaining developer trust and preventing ecosystem fragmentation.

### Gateway and Control Plane Patterns Are Emerging

Docker, Kong, Stacklok, and Bloomberg all presented gateway/middleware patterns. This suggests the ecosystem is coalescing around a standard architecture: clients → gateway/control plane → MCP servers, with the middle layer handling auth, observability, rate limiting, and context management.

### Enterprise Case Studies Are Multiplying

Pinterest (66K monthly invocations, 844 users), Duolingo (180+ MCP tools), Nordstrom, Bloomberg, WestJet, and PagerDuty all presented production MCP deployments. Six months ago, enterprise case studies were rare. The summit made clear that large organizations are moving from pilots to production.

## 4. What to Watch After the Summit

1. **SDK V2 releases** — Watch for Python SDK updates following Max Isbey's V2 roadmap session. Breaking changes to `mcp.server.auth` are possible.
2. **Authentication RFC** — With six dedicated auth sessions and the OAuth 2.1 spec author present, expect formal proposals for standardized MCP authentication.
3. **Session recordings** — The Linux Foundation typically publishes recordings after their events. These will be valuable for the broader community.
4. **Docker MCP distribution** — Docker's control plane and OCI distribution sessions suggest official tooling for MCP server packaging and deployment.
5. **OpenAI resource support** — Nick Cooper's "MCP x MCP" keynote may lead to announcements about expanded MCP support in ChatGPT and OpenAI's platform.

## 5. Related Events

The AAIF has announced a broader 2026 events program:

- **AGNTCon + MCPCon North America** — The next major event, scaling up from the Dev Summit format
- **AGNTCon + MCPCon Europe** — Expanding the conference to European audiences

These events signal sustained institutional investment in the MCP community beyond a one-time gathering.

## Summary

The first MCP Dev Summit accomplished what first conferences are supposed to: it gave the community a shared understanding of where the protocol is, where it's going, and what problems need solving. The dominant message was clear — MCP has won the protocol adoption race, and the hard work of security, standardization, and enterprise-grade tooling is now the priority.

For organizations evaluating MCP adoption, the summit's enterprise track provided concrete evidence that production deployments are viable and growing. For developers, the SDK V2 roadmap and security sessions offer a preview of the changes coming in the second half of 2026.
