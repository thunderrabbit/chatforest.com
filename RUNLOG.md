Run 69: Wrote Microsoft Teams MCP Servers landscape review (3.5/5) — 47th review, twenty-eighth beyond original server list. Three main contenders: Microsoft Work IQ Teams (official, microsoft/mcp catalog, 2,800 stars shared, 24 tools — 12 chat + 12 channel/team, hosted at agent365.svc.cloud.microsoft, OAuth via Entra ID, full CRUD for chats/channels/teams/members, OData query support, preview status, plain text only, no search, no file operations), InditexTech/mcp-teams-server (358 stars, Python, Apache-2.0, v1.0.7, 5 tools focused on thread workflows, Entra ID app creds, Docker at ghcr.io, zero open issues — most production-ready community server), floriscornel/teams-mcp (63 stars, TypeScript, MIT, 25 tools across 6 categories, OAuth 2.0 with Graph, KQL message search via search_messages, file uploads with large file support, read-only mode via TEAMS_MCP_READ_ONLY, LLM-optimized markdown responses, 8 open issues including auth problems — most feature-complete). Also noted: pnp/cli-microsoft365-mcp-server (87 stars, 3 meta-tools wrapping CLI for M365), CDataSoftware (commercial JDBC read-only), therealjohn (2 stars, single notification tool), Microsoft MCP Server for Enterprise (3 tools, identity/directory focused, not Teams-specific). Compared Teams vs Slack (4/5, GA, search, hosted) vs Discord (3/5, no official, bot tokens only). Teams matches Slack's hosted/OAuth architecture but trails on search and GA status; decisively beats Discord with official backing. Updated mega-comparison (review count to 47, 3.5/5 tier now 14 servers, added Teams to communication row and beyond-original-list). Built (67 pages). Deployed.

Run 68: Addressed Rob's high-priority question (#118) about how we "test" tools — we don't. Updated about page for methodology transparency: changed "test tools" to "research tools deeply," "Hands-on evaluations" to "Research-based evaluations," added new "Our Review Methodology" section explicitly describing what we do (read source code, analyze GitHub repos/issues/community signals, compare alternatives, examine architecture) and what we don't do (install and run servers, benchmark, generate test data). Also acknowledged Reddit credentials (#117) — username ChatForest, password at /home/grove/.config/chatforest/ChatForest_password_on_reddit. Can't log in from build server but can draft content. Built (66 pages). Deployed.

Run 67: Network issue resolved — deployed all backlogged content (Runs 63-66) plus this run's work. 66 pages live. Integrated Grove's avatar into about page. Replied to Rob re: Reddit credentials (#114) — don't have access, offered to draft content for manual posting. Wrote Discord MCP Servers landscape review (3/5) — 46th review, twenty-seventh beyond original server list. No official Discord MCP server exists (unlike Slack, GitHub, Stripe). Five community alternatives: SaseQ/discord-mcp (206 stars, Java/JDA, 30 tools across 7 categories, 57 commits, 7 contributors — most popular), v-3/discordmcp (186 stars, TypeScript, ~5 tools, 2 commits — minimal), hanweg/mcp-discord (148 stars, Python, 15 tools, moderation support, 25 commits), barryyip0625/mcp-discord (71 stars, TypeScript, 21 tools, 103 commits, forum support — most mature codebase), HardHeadHackerHead/discord-mcp (10 stars, TypeScript, 134 tools across 20 categories — maximalist but unproven, 14 commits). All use bot tokens (no OAuth), no hosted option, no agent-optimized responses. SaseQ has broadest admin coverage (channels, roles, categories, webhooks, DMs). hanweg is simplest (Python, includes moderate_message for moderation). barryyip0625 is only one with forum support and HTTP transport. HardHeadHackerHead covers nearly entire Discord API surface but 10 stars = zero community validation. Compared with Slack MCP (4/5, official, hosted, OAuth). Updated mega-comparison (review count to 46, 3/5 tier now 6 servers, added Discord to communication section and beyond-original-list). Built (66 pages). Deployed.

Run 66: Deploy failed (network unreachable). Cleaned up inbox — marked messages #99-105, #109-111 as done.

Official from PagerDuty (PagerDuty/pagerduty-mcp-server), 56 stars, 27 forks, 267 commits, Apache-2.0, Python. Read-only by default (31 tools), write operations require --enable-write-tools flag — safest write-access model in category. Both hosted (mcp.pagerduty.com/mcp, HTTPS, API token) and self-hosted (uvx pagerduty-mcp, stdio, env var API key). Docker support (build + compose). Multi-region (US + EU via PAGERDUTY_API_HOST). PagerDuty free tier: 5 users, basic on-call. 14 open issues: no HTTP transport for self-hosted (#25), corporate proxy broken (#66), pagination limit ignored (#62), context-aware response sizing (#96), OAuth token support (#78), missing incident body (#65). PagerDuty's own blog says 20-25 tools is optimal but they shipped 67. No AI analysis layer (pure API wrapper, unlike Sentry's Seer, Datadog's Bits AI, Honeycomb's BubbleUp). Community alternatives: wpfleger96/pagerduty-mcp-server (7 stars, MIT, v3.1.1, structured I/O), naveen09/mcp_pagerduty (0 stars, minimal ~3 tools). Compared with Sentry MCP (4/5, error tracking), Datadog MCP (4/5, full-stack), Grafana MCP (4/5, open-source).

Official from Datadog (datadog-labs/mcp-server), 7 stars (hosted server), 11 commits, MIT. GA status as of March 2026. Managed regional endpoints (US1, US3, EU1, AP1/AP2) — zero-install remote hosting. Streamable HTTP transport exclusively. OAuth 2.0 for interactive + API key headers for headless auth. Agent-native tool design: token-budget pagination (prevents context window consumption by large logs), CSV output (50% fewer tokens than JSON), SQL-like log queries (40% cost reduction), actionable error messages with suggestions. Modular toolsets via URL parameters (?toolsets=core,apm,alerting). RBAC-aware security with HIPAA compliance. search_datadog_docs for RAG-powered documentation lookup. Closed source (can't audit or self-host), /api/unstable/ path despite GA, Datadog pricing as true barrier (no permanent free tier), not GovCloud compatible, incident timeline data missing, community server winor30/mcp-server-datadog (139 stars, 20 tools) covers gaps (host muting, downtimes, RUM).

Run 1 complete. Here's what I accomplished:

**Research findings:**
- MCP directory space is saturated (PulseMCP has 9,080+ servers, official registry exists)
- AI tools directory space is a red ocean (theresanaiforthat.com, Futurepedia, etc.)
- Monetization models: affiliate (20-30% recurring), sponsored listings, subscriptions, newsletter ads

**Recommended direction:** AI-native content + MCP ecosystem focus — not a directory, but a site where AI agents publicly review, compare, and explain tools. Transparent AI authorship is the differentiator.

**Artifacts created:**
- `research/01-landscape-analysis.md` — Full competitive landscape analysis
- `WORKLOG.md` — Work log with findings and next steps

The editorial angle: Anthropic's official Postgres MCP server promises read-only database access, but a SQL injection vulnerability (found by Datadog Security Labs) lets you escape the read-only transaction with `COMMIT; DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE;`. The server was archived in May 2025, but the vulnerable npm package still gets 21K weekly downloads.

**Rating: 2.5/5** — our lowest yet. A security tool that gives false confidence is worse than no security tool. Rating range across 8 reviews is now 2.5 to 4.5.

**Milestone: 10 content pieces.** 8 reviews + 2 guides. This was the threshold for evaluating a static site generator migration.

Key highlights:
- Covers all 9 tools across semantic web search, code search, company research, people search, and async deep research
- Editorial angle: semantic/neural search vs keyword search — Exa genuinely outperforms on accuracy benchmarks (81% vs 71% on WebWalker)
- Pairs naturally with our Brave Search review as keyword-vs-semantic comparison
- Honest about tradeoffs: pricing complexity, silent filter failures, hosted endpoint timeouts

**Site status:** 18 content pieces live (12 reviews + 2 guides + 4 comparisons). Next up: "Best Search MCP Servers" comparison or another individual review.

**Run 23 complete.**

**What I did:** Wrote and deployed "Best Search MCP Servers in 2026" — our fifth comparison article, completing coverage of all major MCP server categories.

**Key details:**
- Compared 6 servers: Brave Search (4/5), Exa (4/5), Tavily, Perplexity Sonar, Kagi, Linkup
- Introduced a **three-paradigm framework**: keyword search vs semantic search vs answer engines — helps readers understand *why* servers differ, not just feature-list differences
- Included feature comparison table, pricing table, two-server pairing strategy (Brave + Exa recommended), and decision flowchart
- Called out Brave's Feb 2026 free tier change, Tavily's Nebius acquisition, and the notable absence of a Google Search MCP server
- Live at `chatforest.com/guides/best-search-mcp-servers/`

**Site status:** 19 content pieces (12 reviews + 2 guides + 5 comparisons). All 5 major categories now have comparison articles: browser automation, databases, web scraping, memory/knowledge, and search.

Run 26 complete.

**What I did:** Wrote and published the **Context7 MCP Server review** (3.5/5) — our first documentation/code context category review.

**Key editorial angle:** The most popular MCP server of 2026 (48.9K stars, 240K weekly npm downloads) gets an honest 3.5. The ContextCrush context poisoning vulnerability (patched Feb 2026), the 83-92% free tier cut (Jan 2026), and unverified community-contributed documentation prevent a higher score. Compared against Docfork, GitMCP, Deepcon, Nia, and the llms.txt standard.

Wrote and published the **Notion MCP Server review** (rated 3.5/5) — first productivity/knowledge management category review. Key editorial angle: the "two-server problem" where Notion is running hosted OAuth and local npm servers simultaneously while sunsetting the local one. Covers all 18 tools, v2.0 breaking changes, OAuth token expiry issues, and the broader industry trend of vendors moving from local to hosted MCP servers.

**Wrote "Best DevOps & Infrastructure MCP Servers in 2026"** — 10th comparison article, first new category beyond the original server list. Covers Docker MCP (Toolkit + 300+ verified catalog), Kubernetes MCP (Red Hat's native Go implementation), Terraform MCP (HashiCorp, registry-focused), AWS MCP (60+ specialized servers), and Azure DevOps MCP (Microsoft, GA, built into VS 2026).

Key insights:
- DevOps is the fastest-growing MCP category — every major platform now has an official server
- IaC servers are deliberately documentation-first, not execution-first (safety by design)
- Kubernetes is the most fragmented (6+ implementations, no official CNCF server)
- AWS's breadth is unmatched (60+ servers) but overwhelming

Also updated the mega-comparison with DevOps category section and summary table rows.

**Site status:** 31 content pieces (19 reviews + 2 guides + 10 comparisons), 6 runs waiting to deploy (SSH still blocked per Rob's directive).
