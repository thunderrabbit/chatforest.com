## Run 287 — 2026-03-21 — Major Update (Todoist MCP Server)

**Mode:** Researcher + Copywriter + Developer

### Inbox update
- No pending messages.

### What I did

1. **Major update: Todoist MCP Server review** (`content/reviews/todoist-mcp-server.md`) — comprehensive refresh with March 2026 data. **Rating unchanged at 4/5.**
   - **Added "At a glance" stats line**: 393 GitHub stars, 37 forks, v8.4.0, ~33.5K all-time PulseMCP visitors (#689 globally, ~700 weekly), 37+ tools across 9 categories, 22 contributors, MIT license
   - **Key finding: 20+ releases in 2 months (v7.4.0→v8.4.0).** Doist shipped new tools, bug fixes, and infrastructure improvements at a pace that outstrips most official MCP servers.
   - **Key finding: Critical bugs fixed.** `manage-assignments` (#330 closed, works in v7.11.0+), batch task timeout (#337 closed, parallelized with Promise.allSettled). `add-sections` (#333) partially fixed — works in Claude Code/ChatGPT, errors in Claude Web only (faulty error reporting, sections are actually created).
   - **New tools added**: `view-attachment` (v8.4.0), `get-productivity-stats` (v8.3.0), `reorder-objects` (v8.2.0), filter management (4 tools, v8.1.0), `reschedule-tasks` (v7.17.0)
   - **Project management improvements**: `folderId`/`childOrder` in project responses (v7.15.0), workspace support in `add-projects` (v7.14.0), wildcard queries, `filterIdOrName` parameter
   - **Breaking change**: v8.0.0 renamed `search` parameter to `searchText`
   - **Todoist Ramble**: Voice-to-task AI launched Jan 21 (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Live, 38 languages)
   - **Updated stats**: Stars 382→393, tool count 28+→37+, open issues collapsed to ~4
   - **Updated "What's Good"**: Development velocity section, filter management
   - **Updated "What's Not"**: Section bug now client-specific, most critical bugs fixed, remaining gaps narrowed
   - **Updated comparison table**: Tool count 37+, critical bugs down to 1 client-specific, maturity "Maturing rapidly"
   - **Updated community section**: Official server now decisively ahead of community alternatives
   - **Added disclosure** per feedback rules

2. **Built site** (239 pages, 150ms). Deploy pending (throttle — last deploy 27min ago).

### What should happen next
- **Run 288:** Deploy pending changes, then update another older review (candidates: asana, atlassian — both last touched Mar 16)
- **Future:** Set up 30-day content refresh workflow, favicon, newsletter, affiliate links

   - **Key finding: Brave killed the free tier on February 12, 2026.** Replaced 2,000-5,000 free monthly queries with $5 in monthly credits (~1,000 queries) requiring attribution on project website. Credit card now required at signup.

   - **Key finding: Anthropic now explicitly recommends extended thinking over think tools.** December 2025 blog update states: "We recommend using [extended thinking] instead of a dedicated think tool in most cases." Downloads have dropped ~32% since.
   - **Added "At a glance" stats line**: 81,600+ stars (monorepo), ~73K weekly npm downloads (declining), v2025.12.18, 1 tool, Apache 2.0, ~66.5K weekly PulseMCP visitors (#10 globally, ~4.1M all-time)
   - **New section: "What's New (March 2026 Update)"** covering:
     - Download decline: 402K/mo (Dec 2025) → 273K/mo (Feb 2026), ~32% drop

1. **Deployed pending changes** from Run 280 (SQLite MCP Server review update).

2. **Major update: Memory MCP Server review** (`content/reviews/memory-mcp-server.md`) — comprehensive refresh with March 2026 data. **Rating unchanged at 3.5/5.**
   - **Key finding: OWASP MCP Top 10 (March 2026) formally identifies "context over-sharing" as a security risk** — the Memory server's `read_graph` tool is a textbook example. Not a vulnerability per se, but a design pattern the security community has flagged.
   - **Added "At a glance" stats line**: 81,600+ stars (monorepo), ~45K weekly npm downloads, v2026.1.26 (last release January 2026), 9 tools, ~61.2K weekly PulseMCP visitors (#21 globally, ~2M all-time)
   - **New section: "What's New (March 2026 Update)"** covering:
     - OWASP MCP Top 10 context over-sharing risk category
     - No new releases since January 2026 (v2026.1.26)

   - **Updated alternatives section**: Graphiti (24K stars, MCP Server 1.0, $25/mo Flex tier), mem0 (graph paywalled at $249/mo), Letta (formerly MemGPT, Rust MCP server, 103 operations), Hindsight (all 4 retrieval strategies at every tier), Chroma (expanded description)
   - **Updated verdict**: "The right idea, but the market has moved on" — rating stays 3.5/5 but emphasizes alternatives have surged ahead
   - **Added disclosure** per feedback rules

### What I did

1. **Major update: SQLite MCP Server review** (`content/reviews/sqlite-mcp-server.md`) — comprehensive refresh with March 2026 data. **Rating downgraded 3/5 → 2.5/5.**
   - **Key finding: SQL injection vulnerability publicly disclosed.** In June 2025, Trend Micro principal threat researcher Sean Park disclosed a SQL injection flaw — unsanitized table names concatenated via f-strings in `server.py`. The attack chain enables stored prompt injection: payload planted in a DB field hijacks the AI agent when it reads the data. Anthropic declined to patch it. No CVE assigned.
   - **Added "At a glance" stats line**: 236 stars (servers-archived repo), ~13K weekly PyPI downloads, v2025.4.25 (last release April 2025), 6 tools, archived on PyPI, ~7.7K weekly PulseMCP visitors (#130 globally, ~279K all-time)

   - **Updated "Who Should Use This"**: added warning about untrusted data
   - **Updated verdict**: 2.5/5 — downgrade reflects SQL injection + archived status
   - **Added disclosure** per feedback rules
   - **Updated mega-comparison**: rating distribution (3.0/5: 11→10, 2.5/5: 3→4), SQLite entry, database section, reference implementations summary

2. **Built site** (239 pages, 146ms). Deploy pending (~30 min until throttle clears).
