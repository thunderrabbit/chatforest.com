> Runs 1-28 archived in `WORKLOG-archive-runs-01-28.md`

## Run 71 — 2026-03-14 — Inbox Actions + Log Archival + Reviews Fix

**Mode:** Developer + Operations

### Inbox update
- Addressed all 5 pending messages from Rob (#128-132).

### What I did

1. **Fixed /reviews page subtitle (#128)**
   - Changed "Hands-on evaluations" to "Honest, research-driven evaluations" — matches our actual methodology
   - Built and deployed (67 pages)

2. **Set up DreamHost access log archival (#129)**
   - Created `scripts/archive-logs.sh` — pulls HTTPS access logs from DreamHost via rsync
   - Added daily cron: `15 6 * * *` (6:15 AM UTC / 3:15 PM JST)
   - Archives to `~/chatforest.com/logs/` (gitignored)
   - First run successfully pulled 8 days of logs (Mar 6-14)
   - Auto-compresses logs older than 2 days
   - Added `logs/` and `.last_run` to `.gitignore`

3. **Sent Google Search Console reminder (#130)**
   - Sent Rob steps via inbox #133 — DNS TXT verification at DreamHost panel

4. **Sorted posting platforms by priority (#131)**
   - Sent ranked list via inbox #134: Dev.to (REST API) > Bluesky (AT Protocol) > Hashnode (GraphQL) > Mastodon
   - All free, all bot-friendly, Rob needs to create accounts

5. **Archived Reddit decision (#132)**
   - Saved decision to memory (`project_reddit_archived.md`)
   - Created Jikan todo #209 due 2027-03-14 to revisit
   - Reddit account dormant; too expensive ($12K/yr) and can't post from build server

6. **First traffic analysis** from archived logs (Mar 13, HTTPS):
   - 388 total requests, ~28 homepage hits, real content visits to reviews and guides
   - Top content: fetch-mcp-server, best-web-scraping-mcp-servers, sentry-mcp-server, playwright-mcp-server
   - Significant WordPress exploit scanning (wp-content, admin.php, etc.) — expected, harmless for static site

### Site status
- **Committed, deployed this run**
- 67 pages: 47 reviews + 4 guides + 11 comparisons + other pages
- Log archival now running daily

### What should happen next
- **Run 72:** Write content — communication comparison guide (Slack vs Discord vs Teams) or another review
- **Waiting on Rob:** Google Search Console setup, posting platform accounts (Dev.to first)
- **Future:** Weekly traffic reports from archived logs, favicon, newsletter, affiliate links

## Run 70 — 2026-03-14 — Inbox Deep Dive: Research for Rob

**Mode:** Researcher

### Inbox update
- Addressed all 6 pending messages from Rob (#122-127). Major research topics below.

### What I did

1. **Responded to Rob's traffic measurement question (#127)**
   - Researched DreamHost analytics options (AWStats removed in 2023, no built-in stats)
   - Recommended three-tier approach: access log archival (Tier 1, can do now), Google Search Console (Tier 3, Rob sets up), GoatCounter analytics (Tier 3)
   - Set realistic traffic expectations: 50-200/day month 1, scaling to 500-1000/day by month 3

2. **Researched secure email options (#126)**
   - Compared forwarding services (Cloudflare, ImprovMX, ForwardEmail), hosted email (Zoho free, Fastmail, ProtonMail), DreamHost built-in, and contact forms (Formspree)
   - Key insight: forward to Gmail and let Google filter spam — zero manual tuning
   - Recommended ImprovMX → Gmail forwarding + Formspree contact form (both free, no DNS migration)

3. **Provided Google Search Console verification URL (#125)**
   - Directed Rob to https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080 for DNS TXT verification steps
   - This is a Tier 3 action Rob needs to do himself

4. **Researched auto-posting platforms (#124)**
   - Best options: Dev.to (REST API, perfect for dev content), Bluesky (explicitly bot-friendly), Mastodon (bot-friendly, federated), Hashnode (GraphQL API)
   - Not feasible: X/Twitter ($200/mo for write), Hacker News (no write API), LinkedIn (requires partner approval)
   - **Moltbook: strongly recommended against** — major security breach (1.5M API keys exposed, Feb 2026), widely called "AI theater" by MIT Tech Review, would damage ChatForest credibility

5. **Confirmed deploy stability (#123)**
   - DreamHost issue was on their side, confirmed no excessive requests from our end
   - Deploy throttle (max 1/hour) working as designed

6. **Researched Reddit API (#122)**
   - PRAW library works with Python 3.11 on our server
   - Rob needs to register an API app at reddit.com/prefs/apps + get pre-approval (2025 policy change)
   - Major blocker: free tier is non-commercial only, paid tier is $12K/year
   - Recommended starting with Dev.to + Bluesky instead (free, no commercial restrictions)

### Site status
- **No content changes this run** — focused on research and inbox responses
- 67 pages: 47 reviews + 4 guides + 11 comparisons + other pages

### What should happen next
- **Run 71:** Write content — communication comparison guide (Slack vs Discord vs Teams) or another review. Could also draft sample Dev.to/Bluesky posts for Rob to review.
- **If Rob approves:** Set up access log archival cron, add Formspree contact form, create Dev.to/Bluesky accounts (Tier 3)
- **Future:** Favicon, newsletter setup, affiliate link integration, WORKLOG rotation

## Run 69 — 2026-03-14 — Microsoft Teams MCP Servers Review

**Mode:** Researcher + Copywriter + Developer

### Inbox update
- No pending messages.

### What I did

1. **Wrote "Microsoft Teams MCP Servers — Official at Last, Community Got There First"** — `content/reviews/teams-mcp-servers.md`
   - **47th review**, twenty-eighth review beyond the original server list
   - Rating: **3.5/5** — landscape review of the Teams MCP ecosystem
   - Three main contenders:
     - **Microsoft Work IQ Teams** (official, microsoft/mcp catalog, 2,800 stars shared): 24 tools (12 chat + 12 channel/team), hosted at agent365.svc.cloud.microsoft, OAuth via Entra ID, full CRUD, OData query support, preview status, plain text only, no search, no file operations
     - **InditexTech/mcp-teams-server** (358 stars, Python, Apache-2.0, v1.0.7): 5 tools focused on thread workflows, Entra ID app creds, Docker support, zero open issues — most production-ready
     - **floriscornel/teams-mcp** (63 stars, TypeScript, MIT): 25 tools, OAuth 2.0 with Graph, KQL message search, file uploads, read-only mode, 8 open issues — most feature-complete
   - Also covered: pnp/cli-microsoft365-mcp-server (87 stars, CLI wrapper), CDataSoftware (commercial), therealjohn (2 stars, notification only), Microsoft MCP Server for Enterprise (identity/directory, not Teams-specific)
   - Comparison table: Teams vs Slack (4/5) vs Discord (3/5) — Teams matches Slack's hosted/OAuth architecture but trails on search and GA status
   - New "communication" category expansion beyond Slack and Discord

2. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added Teams (3.5/5) to communication row runner-up
   - Added Teams entry to communication section
   - Added Teams to "Beyond the original list" section
   - Updated review count to 47
   - Updated rating distribution (3.5/5 tier now has 14 servers)

3. **Build succeeded** (51ms, 67 pages). **Deployed to chatforest.com** — 67 pages live.

### Site status
- **Committed, deployed this run**
- 67 pages: 47 reviews + 4 guides + 11 comparisons + other pages
- Communication category now has all three major platforms reviewed: Slack (4/5), Teams (3.5/5), Discord (3/5)

### What should happen next
- **Run 70:** Write a "communication" comparison guide (Slack vs Discord vs Teams). Or write another review (Anthropic Claude MCP, Raygun, Axiom). Could also draft a Reddit post for Rob to share.
- **Future:** Favicon, newsletter setup, affiliate link integration, WORKLOG rotation (approaching size limit)

## Run 68 — 2026-03-14 — Methodology Transparency + About Page Update

**Mode:** Copywriter + Developer

### Inbox update
- **Message #118 (Rob, high priority):** Asked how we "test" tools — great question. We don't actually test them hands-on. Updated about page to be transparent about our research-based methodology. Marked done.
- **Message #117 (Rob):** Reddit credentials for ChatForest account. Noted username, password location, and profile image URL. Can't log in directly from build server but can draft content for Rob to post. Marked done.

### What I did

1. **Fixed misleading claims on about page** — Rob correctly pointed out that saying "We test tools" is inaccurate. Our methodology is research-based (reading source code, docs, GitHub issues, community signals), not hands-on testing. Changes:
   - "We test tools, form opinions, and share them clearly" → "We research tools deeply, form opinions, and share them clearly"
   - "We review, test, and explain" → "We review and explain"
   - "Hands-on evaluations" → "Research-based evaluations"
   - "testing tools" → "analyzing tools" in the How We Work section
   - **Added new "Our Review Methodology" section** — explicitly explains what we do (read source code, analyze community signals, read issues, compare alternatives, examine architecture) and what we don't do (install and run servers, generate test data, benchmark performance)

2. **Built site** (66 pages, 52ms) and **deployed to chatforest.com**.

3. **Saved Reddit credentials reference** to project memory for future runs.

### Site status
- **Committed, deployed this run**
- 66 pages, 46 reviews — content unchanged, about page updated for transparency

### What should happen next
- **Run 69:** Write another review (Teams MCP, Anthropic Claude MCP, Raygun, Axiom) or start a "communication" comparison guide (Slack vs Discord vs Teams). Could also draft a Reddit post for Rob to share.
- **Future:** Favicon, newsletter setup, affiliate link integration, WORKLOG rotation (approaching size limit)

## Run 67 — 2026-03-14 — Deploy + Avatar + Review (Discord MCP Servers)

**Mode:** Developer + Researcher + Copywriter

### Inbox update
- **Message #112 (self):** Deploy failure update — marked done, network issue resolved this run.
- **Message #114 (Rob):** Asked about Reddit credentials — replied via #116: don't have access to any Reddit credentials, offered to draft content for Rob to post manually. Marked done.
- **Message #115 (Rob):** Profile pic is live — integrated avatar into about page. Marked done.

### What I did

1. **Deployed all backlogged content** — Network issue resolved! Runs 63-66 content (PagerDuty, Honeycomb, New Relic, Datadog reviews + all updates) now live on chatforest.com. 65 pages deployed, then 66 after this run's work.

2. **Integrated Grove's avatar** into the about page — profile pic from Rob at `https://b.robnugen.com/peeps/grove/2026/2026_mar_14_grove_profile_pic.png`, float-right with rounded corners.

3. **Wrote "Discord MCP Servers — Five Community Servers, No Official One, and a Fragmented Landscape"** — `content/reviews/discord-mcp-servers.md`
   - **46th review**, twenty-seventh review beyond the original server list
   - Rating: **3/5** — landscape review of the Discord MCP ecosystem
   - No official Discord MCP server exists (unlike Slack, GitHub, Stripe)
   - Five community alternatives reviewed:
     - SaseQ/discord-mcp: 206 stars, Java/JDA, 30 tools, 7 categories, 7 contributors — most popular
     - v-3/discordmcp: 186 stars, TypeScript, ~5 tools, 2 commits — stars without substance
     - hanweg/mcp-discord: 148 stars, Python, 15 tools, moderation support — simplest
     - barryyip0625/mcp-discord: 71 stars, TypeScript, 21 tools, 103 commits — most mature, only one with forum support
     - HardHeadHackerHead/discord-mcp: 10 stars, TypeScript, 134 tools, 20 categories — maximalist but unproven
   - All use bot tokens (no OAuth), no hosted option, no agent-optimized responses
   - New "communication" category expansion beyond Slack

4. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added Discord to communication row runner-up
   - Added Discord entry to communication section
   - Added Discord to "Beyond the original list" section
   - Updated review count to 46
   - Updated rating distribution (3/5 tier now has 6 servers)

- 60 content pieces: 46 reviews + 4 guides + 11 comparisons
- Discord is the 6th server rated 3/5
- Network issue resolved — deploy working again after 4 failed runs

### What should happen next
- **Run 68:** Could write more reviews in new categories — Teams MCP, Anthropic Claude MCP, or continue with developer tools (Raygun, Axiom). Could also start a "communication" comparison guide (Slack vs Discord vs Teams).
- **Future:** Favicon, newsletter setup, affiliate link integration, WORKLOG rotation (approaching size limit)

   - Compared with Sentry (error tracking), Datadog (full-stack), Grafana (open-source), Honeycomb (event-based), New Relic (natural language)
   - Completes the "big six" observability comparison — all six now reviewed at 4/5

3. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Updated PagerDuty entry with review link, rating (4/5), 67 tools, dual deployment
   - Added PagerDuty to "Beyond the original list" section

   - Rating: **4/5** — fastest path from question to answer, with unmatched deep research, held back by no free tier and timeout-prone deep research
   - 4 tools: search (ranked results), ask (conversational AI with sonar-pro), research (deep reports with sonar-deep-research), reason (analytical reasoning with sonar-reasoning-pro)
   - Official server from Perplexity (perplexityai/modelcontextprotocol), 2,000 stars, TypeScript, MIT
   - Answer engine approach: returns synthesized answers with citations instead of links
   - Four purpose-built Sonar models mapped to four tools — search, ask, research, reason
   - Deep research produces multi-paragraph cited reports no other MCP server matches
   - Zero open issues (42 closed) — best maintenance record in the search category
   - Corporate proxy support, Docker deployment, one-click Cursor/VS Code installers
   - Honest about issues: no free tier (highest entry barrier in search category), deep research timeouts with strict MCP clients, no access to raw sources, complex per-token + per-request pricing, Tier 0 rate limits start at 50 RPM, no remote hosted server (unlike Tavily), npx stdout pollution causes EOF errors
   - Compared with Brave (more search verticals, free tier, flat pricing), Exa (semantic search, source discovery), Tavily (search + extract + crawl pipeline, hosted server), community Perplexity wrappers

3. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added Perplexity 4/5 review link to answer engines section
   - Added Perplexity to "Beyond the original list" section

## Run 44 — 2026-03-14 — Timestamps in Content (Rob's Editorial Request)

**Mode:** Developer

### Inbox update
- **#105 (normal, Rob):** Editorial suggestion — show timestamps down to the second instead of just dates. Since all articles were published on the same day, timestamps highlight autonomous agent production in real-time bursts. Fits transparent AI authorship brand. Implemented.

### What I did

1. **Updated all 38 content files** with precise timestamps from git commit history
   - Front matter `date:` changed from `2026-03-14` to full ISO 8601 with timezone (e.g., `2026-03-14T09:42:34+09:00`)
   - Timestamps reflect when each piece was actually committed — showing the real production timeline

2. **Updated 5 layout templates** to display full timestamps
   - `layouts/reviews/single.html` — review pages now show `2026-03-14 09:42:34` format
   - `layouts/guides/single.html` — guide pages match
   - `layouts/partials/article-card.html` — listing cards show timestamps
   - `layouts/partials/schema-review.html` — Schema.org `datePublished` now ISO 8601 with time+timezone
   - `layouts/partials/schema-article.html` — same for article schema

3. **Build succeeded** (37ms, 43 pages). **Deploy throttled** — only 8 minutes since last deploy, need 51 more minutes per Rob's 1-deploy/hour rule.

### Site status
- **Committed, NOT deployed** (deploy throttle — will deploy next eligible run)
- 38 content pieces: 24 reviews + 4 guides + 10 comparisons

- **#104 (high, Rob):** New deploy rule — deploy at most once per hour using `.last_deploy` file. Implemented.
- **#103 (from me):** SSH restored message from Run 42. Marked seen.

### What I did

1. **Implemented deploy throttle** per Rob's message #104
   - Created `.gitignore` with `.last_deploy`, `.grove_lock`, `resources/_gen/`, `site/`
   - Deploy now checks `.last_deploy` age before attempting rsync
   - After successful deploy, touches `.last_deploy`
   - On failure, does NOT touch `.last_deploy` (per Rob's spec)

2. **Wrote "The Qdrant MCP Server — Semantic Memory Through Your AI Assistant"** — `content/reviews/qdrant-mcp-server.md`
   - **24th review**, fifth review beyond the original server list
   - Rating: **3/5** — most adopted vector DB MCP server (1,300 stars), but too minimal
   - Only 2 tools: `qdrant-store` and `qdrant-find` — no delete, no update, no collection management
   - Only vector DB MCP server supporting all three transports: stdio, SSE, Streamable HTTP
   - Extensible `QdrantMCPServer` class architecture (v0.8.0) — a "server as framework" approach
   - Local embedded mode via `QDRANT_LOCAL_PATH` — zero infrastructure semantic memory
   - Customizable tool descriptions via environment variables
   - Honest about tradeoffs: 2 tools vs Chroma's 13, no delete capability (open issues #74/#101), FastEmbed-only default, no OAuth for MCP transport, 22 open issues with basic feature requests
   - Comparison table with Chroma (13 tools), Pinecone (9 tools), Milvus (11 tools), Weaviate (2 tools)

3. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added Qdrant 3/5 link to vector database runner-up in summary table
   - Added review link and detail to vector database section
   - Added Qdrant to "Beyond the original list" section
   - Updated review count to 24, rating distribution (3/5 cluster now has 2 servers: SQLite, Qdrant)

4. **Updated database comparison** (`content/guides/best-database-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added Qdrant MCP as alternative for vector search / RAG use cases

5. **Build succeeded** (41ms, 43 pages). **Deployed successfully** to chatforest.com.

### Site status
- **Committed AND deployed**
- 38 content pieces: 24 reviews + 4 guides + 10 comparisons
- Deploy throttle now active (max 1 deploy/hour per Rob's directive)

### What should happen next
- **Run 44:** Could write Pinecone MCP, Milvus MCP, or "Best Vector Database MCP Servers in 2026" comparison. Or a workflow guide.
- **Run 45+:** Execute promotion plan when accounts approved.
- **Future:** Favicon, newsletter setup, affiliate link integration, new review targets

## Run 42 — 2026-03-14 — Deploy + Review (Chroma MCP Server)

**Mode:** Operations + Researcher + Copywriter + Developer

### Inbox update
- **#102 (high, Rob):** DreamHost outage may be resolved — asked for ONE SSH test. SSH succeeded! Deployed all backlogged content. Replied as message #103.

### What I did

1. **SSH restored and all content deployed** — 11 runs of backlogged content (runs 31-41) now live on chatforest.com
   - SSH was returning "Too many authentication failures" because I used `grove@chatforest.com` instead of the `chat` alias (which uses user `backforest` with the correct key)
   - 42 pages deployed: 23 reviews + 4 guides + 10 comparisons + about + homepage + listings

2. **Wrote "The Chroma MCP Server — Vector Database Operations Through Your AI Assistant"** — `content/reviews/chroma-mcp-server.md`
   - **23rd review**, fourth review beyond the original server list
   - Rating: **3.5/5** — most comprehensive vector DB MCP server, but stdio-only and stalling development
   - 13 tools: 8 collection management + 5 document operations
   - Four deployment modes: ephemeral (in-memory), persistent (local files), HTTP (self-hosted), Cloud
   - Six embedding providers: Default, Cohere, OpenAI, Jina, VoyageAI, Roboflow
   - Unique feature: `chroma_fork_collection` — duplicate collections for experimentation
   - Search: semantic + full-text + regex through single `query_documents` tool
   - HNSW parameter configuration at collection creation
   - Honest about tradeoffs: stdio-only transport (no remote MCP), Python-only, beta with no releases in 7 months, context-bloating query results, known bugs (non-ASCII corruption, embedding dimension mismatches)
   - Comparison with Qdrant (1,300 stars, 2 tools, better transport), Pinecone (9 tools, cloud-only), Weaviate (2 tools, minimal)

3. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added "Vector database" row with Chroma 3.5/5 as pick, Qdrant as runner-up
   - Added full vector database section between databases and memory
   - Added Chroma to "Beyond the original list" section
   - Updated review count to 23, rating distribution (3.5/5 cluster now has 8 servers)

4. **Updated database comparison** (`content/guides/best-database-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added Chroma to decision flowchart for vector search / RAG use cases

5. **Build succeeded** (40ms, 42 pages). **Deployed successfully** to chatforest.com.

### Site status
- **Committed AND deployed** — first successful deploy since Run 29
- 37 content pieces: 23 reviews + 4 guides + 10 comparisons
- All backlogged content now live

### What should happen next
- **Run 43:** Could write Pinecone MCP, Qdrant MCP, or a workflow guide ("MCP Servers for CI/CD Pipelines"). Or a new comparison: "Best Vector Database MCP Servers in 2026".
- **Run 44+:** Execute promotion plan when accounts approved.
- **Future:** Favicon, newsletter setup, affiliate link integration, new review targets

## Run 41 — 2026-03-14 — Review (Linear MCP Server)

### What I did

1. **Wrote "The Linear MCP Server — Issue Tracking and Project Management Through Your AI Assistant"** — `content/reviews/linear-mcp-server.md`
   - **22nd review**, third review beyond the original server list
   - Rating: **4/5** — best-in-class tool design, but high context cost and remote-only deployment
   - 23+ tools across issues, projects, initiatives, milestones, teams, labels, and documentation
   - Hosted remote-first at `mcp.linear.app/mcp` with OAuth 2.1 and Streamable HTTP transport
   - Standout: flat parameter schemas (flattened from GraphQL), embedded enum values, "me" shortcut for assignee — reduces agent errors significantly
   - February 2026 expansion added initiatives, milestones, project updates — moved from engineering tracker to full PM platform
   - Broad client support: Claude, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Zed, Codex, Jules, v0
   - Honest about tradeoffs: 17.3k token context cost, verbose responses with unnecessary fields, no delete/archive, remote-only, requires paid Linear ($8/user/month), connection reliability issues
   - Comparison with Asana, Atlassian/Jira, Todoist — Linear wins on tool design quality

2. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added Linear 4/5 link to Productivity (tasks) row in summary table
   - Updated Linear section with review link and 23+ tool count
   - Added Linear to "Beyond the original list" section

### Site status
- **Committed, NOT deployed** (per Rob's directive — no SSH until cleared)
- 36 content pieces: 22 reviews + 4 guides + 10 comparisons
- 11 runs of content waiting to deploy

### What should happen next
- **Run 42:** Check inbox for Rob's SSH clearance. Could write Chroma MCP, Pinecone MCP, or a workflow guide ("MCP Servers for CI/CD Pipelines").
- **Run 43+:** Deploy when Rob clears SSH. Execute promotion plan when accounts approved.
- **Future:** Favicon, newsletter setup, affiliate link integration, new review targets

## Run 40 — 2026-03-14 — Review (Stripe MCP Server)

**Mode:** Researcher + Copywriter + Developer

### What I did

1. **Wrote "The Stripe MCP Server — Payment Operations Through Your AI Assistant"** — `content/reviews/stripe-mcp-server.md`
   - **21st review**, second review beyond the original server list
   - Rating: **4/5** — best-in-class security model, unique documentation search feature
   - 25 tools across 13 resource categories: customers, products, prices, invoices, subscriptions, refunds, payment links, disputes, balance, coupons, search, and documentation
   - Part of broader Stripe Agent Toolkit (1,400 GitHub stars) with framework integrations for OpenAI, LangChain, CrewAI, Vercel AI SDK
   - Three-layer security: OAuth remote server at mcp.stripe.com, restricted API keys with per-resource permissions for local, dashboard session management
   - Killer feature: `search_stripe_documentation` — agent can query Stripe's knowledge base directly
   - Honest about tradeoffs: covers only 10-15% of Stripe's API surface, most resources only support create+list (no updates), no webhooks, no Checkout Sessions, no Connect, protocol version compatibility issue (#290), TypeScript-only local deployment

2. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added "Payments" row with Stripe 4/5 as pick
   - Added full Payments section describing the server and its Agent Toolkit context
   - Updated "Beyond the original list" to mention Stripe alongside Cloudflare
   - Updated review count to 21, rating distribution (4/5 cluster now has 9 servers)

3. **Build succeeded** (37ms, 40 pages). **Deploy blocked** — complying with Rob's directive to stop all SSH attempts.

### Site status

### What I did

1. **Wrote "The Cloudflare MCP Server — 2,500 API Endpoints in 1,000 Tokens"** — `content/reviews/cloudflare-mcp-server.md`
   - **20th review**, first review beyond our original server list
   - Rating: **4.5/5** — ties with Playwright for our highest rating
   - The most innovative MCP architecture we've reviewed: Code Mode collapses 2,500+ API endpoints into just 2 tools (~1,000 tokens vs 1.17 million for traditional approach)
   - `search()` queries a typed OpenAPI spec; `execute()` runs generated JavaScript in a V8 Dynamic Worker sandbox
   - Plus 16 specialized product servers (Workers Builds, Observability, Browser Rendering, DNS Analytics, AI Gateway, etc.)
   - All remote-first with OAuth, Streamable HTTP transport
   - Also a platform for building MCP servers (Workers + mcp-handler + Agents SDK)
   - Honest about tradeoffs: depends on agent JavaScript competency, fragmented repo structure (3 repos), low Code Mode adoption (262 stars), Cloudflare-only lock-in

2. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added "Cloud infrastructure" row with Cloudflare 4.5/5 as pick
   - Added Cloudflare section to DevOps & infrastructure description

   - Configuration file locations, JSON examples for local (stdio) and remote (Streamable HTTP) servers
   - Explains transport protocol evolution: stdio vs SSE (deprecated) vs Streamable HTTP
   - Four role-specific starter stacks: web developer, backend/data engineer, technical writer, full-stack team
   - Managing multiple servers: performance, context window pressure, security, updates
   - Troubleshooting section covering common issues (server won't start, OAuth failures, silent tool failures, too many tools)
   - Cross-links to all 19 reviews and other guides

2. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added setup guide reference in the "starter stack" section

3. **Updated build tutorial** (`content/guides/build-your-first-mcp-server.md`)

**Mode:** Researcher + Strategist + Developer

### Inbox update
- **High-priority message from Rob + Boss Claude** (message #88): Asked for a traffic/promotion plan — where to post content, social media strategy, open-source Reddit alternatives, what's needed to execute.
- Replied with full plan summary (message #89).

### What I did

1. **Researched traffic/promotion strategies** — web searches on:
   - Developer content promotion tactics for 2026
   - MCP community platforms and developer channels
   - Open-source Reddit alternatives (Lemmy, Kbin, Tildes)
   - SEO timeline expectations for new technical sites
   - Hacker News submission best practices
   - Dev.to/Hashnode cross-posting strategies

2. **Wrote comprehensive traffic & promotion plan** — `strategy/02-traffic-promotion-plan.md`

   - Guides/comparisons get `Article` schema
   - Homepage gets `WebSite` schema
   - Created reusable Hugo partials: `schema-review.html`, `schema-article.html`
   - Used Hugo's `dict` + `jsonify` + `safeJS` pipeline for clean JSON-LD output
   - All 25 content pages + homepage now have structured data

4. **Deployed to chatforest.com** — all pages updated with Schema.org markup

### What should happen next
- **Run 30:** While waiting for Rob's reply on the promotion plan, write another review or comparison.
- **Run 31+:** Execute promotion plan once Rob approves accounts, update mega-comparison with Notion
- **Future:** Favicon, newsletter setup, affiliate links

   - **8th comparison article** — completes coverage of all major MCP server categories (browser, database, web scraping, memory, search, documentation, productivity, plus mega-comparison)
   - Head-to-head comparison of 8 servers: Notion (3.5/5), Linear, Todoist, Asana, Google Calendar, Obsidian, Slack (4/5), Google Workspace
   - Researched current state of each: Linear's Feb 2026 PM tools expansion, Todoist's MCP Apps feature, Asana V2 migration, Google Calendar community server, Obsidian's fragmented ecosystem
   - Identified three architectural patterns: first-party hosted (Notion/Linear/Todoist/Asana/Slack), community local (Google Calendar/Google Workspace), local knowledge (Obsidian)
   - Feature comparison table, decision flowchart by use case, recommended stack
   - Key insight: Google has no official MCP server for any product — the biggest gap in the productivity MCP space
   - Cross-links to our Notion and Slack reviews

2. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added "Productivity & knowledge management" section with all server recommendations
   - Added productivity rows to summary table (Notion 3.5/5 for knowledge, Linear for tasks)

### What I did

1. **Rotated WORKLOG.md** — archived runs 1-28 to `WORKLOG-archive-runs-01-28.md`. Active file went from 88K/1225 lines to ~4K/85 lines. Will rotate again at ~50K.

2. **Wrote "Best Observability MCP Servers in 2026"** — `content/guides/best-observability-mcp-servers.md`
   - **9th comparison article** — completes our category coverage
   - Head-to-head comparison of 6 servers: Sentry (4/5, reviewed), Datadog, Grafana, New Relic, Honeycomb, PagerDuty
   - Three observability layers framework: error tracking (Sentry/Honeycomb), full-stack APM (Datadog/New Relic/Grafana), incident management (PagerDuty)
   - Feature comparison table, decision flowchart, recommended two-server stack
   - Key insight: observability is the most "first-party" MCP category — every major platform has an official server

### Site status
- **Committed, NOT deployed** (network issue — two consecutive runs)
- 26 content pieces: 15 reviews + 2 guides + 9 comparisons
- Comparison articles: browser automation, databases, web scraping, memory/knowledge, search, documentation, productivity, observability, plus mega-comparison
- All major MCP server categories covered

### What should happen next
- **Run 32:** Deploy (retry rsync — network issue has persisted 2 runs). Write another review — Neon MCP server or Figma Dev Mode MCP are good candidates.
- **Run 33+:** Execute promotion plan when Rob replies on accounts, favicon
- **Future:** Newsletter setup, affiliate link integration

## Run 32 — 2026-03-14 — Content (Neon MCP Server Review) + Deploy Diagnosis

**Mode:** Researcher + Copywriter + Developer + Operations

### Inbox update
- 3 pending messages — all from me (replies #95, #96, #97 from Run 31). No new messages from Rob or Boss Claude.
- Sent message #98 (high priority) to Rob: SSH deploy failing for 3 consecutive runs. IPv4 returns "Connection refused" on port 22, IPv6 "Network is unreachable". HTTP and ping work fine. Asked Rob to check DreamHost panel shell access settings.

### What I did

1. **Diagnosed SSH deploy failure** — network is back (HTTP 200, ping works), but SSH port 22 is explicitly refused. This is a DreamHost-side config change, not a network outage. Notified Rob with detailed diagnosis and specific ask (check DreamHost panel → Manage Users → Shell Access).

2. **Wrote "The Neon MCP Server — Serverless Postgres Management Through Natural Language"** — `content/reviews/neon-mcp-server.md`
   - **16th review**, first cloud-native database MCP server
   - Rating: **4/5** — the most capable database MCP server we've reviewed
   - 20 tools covering project management, branch-based migrations, SQL execution, query tuning, auth, and docs
   - Killer feature: branch-based migration workflow using Neon's copy-on-write storage (prepare → verify → merge/discard)
   - OAuth remote server at mcp.neon.tech (npm package deprecated)
   - Honest about tradeoffs: Neon-only lock-in, development-only limitation, OAuth requires browser (no headless support)
   - Neon built formal eval framework and improved tool selection from 60% to 100%
   - Free tier: 100 projects, 100 CU-hrs/mo, 0.5GB storage per branch

3. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added "Database (cloud Postgres)" row with Neon 4/5 as pick
   - Added Neon section to database category description
   - Removed Neon from "servers we haven't reviewed"
   - Updated review count to 16, rating distribution (4/5 cluster now has 7 servers)

4. **Updated database comparison** (`content/guides/best-database-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added Neon as first entry in contenders table
   - Added full "For Cloud Postgres: Neon MCP" section in replacements
   - Updated decision flowchart with Neon for cloud Postgres
   - Updated bottom line recommendation

5. **Build succeeded** (34ms). **Deploy blocked** — SSH still refused. Content committed, 4 runs of content waiting to deploy.

### Site status
- **Committed, NOT deployed** (SSH issue — 3 consecutive runs)
- 27 content pieces: 16 reviews + 2 guides + 9 comparisons
- Rating range: 2.5–4.5 across 16 reviews (4/5 is most common with 7 servers)

### What should happen next
- **Run 33:** Check inbox for Rob's reply on SSH issue. If SSH fixed, deploy immediately. Write another review (Figma Dev Mode MCP or Supabase).
- **Run 34+:** Execute promotion plan when Rob replies on accounts
- **Future:** Favicon, newsletter setup, affiliate link integration

## Run 33 — 2026-03-14 — Content (Supabase MCP Server Review)

**Mode:** Researcher + Copywriter + Developer

### Inbox update
- **#99 (high, Rob):** URGENT — stop all SSH/rsync deploy attempts. DreamHost likely throttled us. Do NOT deploy until Rob clears it. Acknowledged and complying.
- Messages #95-98 (from me, previous runs) still pending replies. All marked as seen.

### What I did

1. **Wrote "The Supabase MCP Server — Full Backend Management Through Your AI Assistant"** — `content/reviews/supabase-mcp-server.md`
   - **17th review**, first BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service) MCP server
   - Rating: **4/5** — unmatched breadth, covering database, edge functions, storage, debugging, and more
   - 8 tool groups: account, docs, database, debugging, development, functions, storage, branching
   - Key differentiator vs Neon: Supabase goes wide (full backend), Neon goes deep (database)
   - Best security model we've reviewed: real read-only PostgreSQL role, project scoping, feature group filtering
   - OAuth 2.1 authentication at mcp.supabase.com (no PAT needed)
   - 2.5k GitHub stars (most popular database MCP server)
   - Honest about tradeoffs: schema-only branching (no data copy like Neon), paid plan required for branching, pre-1.0 stability, BaaS lock-in deeper than database lock-in

2. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added "Backend-as-a-Service" row with Supabase 4/5
   - Updated Supabase from "not yet reviewed" to reviewed with link
   - Removed Supabase from "servers we haven't reviewed" section
   - Updated review count to 17, rating distribution (4/5 cluster now has 8 servers)
   - Updated database section with Supabase alongside Neon

3. **Updated database comparison** (`content/guides/best-database-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added Supabase as first entry in contenders table
   - Added full "For Supabase Users: Supabase MCP" section in replacements
   - Updated decision flowchart with Supabase for full backend management
   - Updated bottom line recommendation

4. **Build succeeded.** **Deploy blocked** — complying with Rob's directive to stop all SSH attempts.

### Site status
- **Committed, NOT deployed** (per Rob's directive — no SSH until cleared)
- 28 content pieces: 17 reviews + 2 guides + 9 comparisons
- Rating range: 2.5–4.5 across 17 reviews (4/5 is most common with 8 servers)
- Only 2 servers remain unreviewed: Figma Dev Mode, Vercel MCP

### What should happen next
- **Run 34:** Check inbox for Rob's SSH clearance. Write Figma Dev Mode or Vercel MCP review.
- **Run 35+:** Deploy when Rob clears SSH. Execute promotion plan when accounts approved.
- **Future:** Favicon, newsletter setup, affiliate link integration

## Run 34 — 2026-03-14 — Content (Vercel MCP Server Review)

**Mode:** Researcher + Copywriter + Developer

### Inbox update
- No pending messages. No SSH clearance from Rob yet. Complying with deploy ban.

### What I did

1. **Wrote "The Vercel MCP Server — Deployment Monitoring and Management Through Your AI Assistant"** — `content/reviews/vercel-mcp-server.md`
   - **18th review**, first deployment platform MCP server
   - Rating: **3.5/5** — solid remote-first architecture with strong security, but thin tool coverage
   - 13 tools across 5 categories: documentation, project management, deployments, domains, access/CLI
   - Standout feature: runtime log querying with filtering by level, status code, time range, and full-text search
   - Clean remote-first setup at `mcp.vercel.com` — zero install, OAuth auth, project-specific URLs
   - Honest about tradeoffs: only covers ~20% of Vercel's platform features, client allowlist limits adoption, deploy is CLI passthrough, still public beta after 7 months
   - Compared to community alternatives (Quegenx with 30+ tools) — official is safer, community is more capable

2. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added "Deployment" category section with Vercel 3.5/5
   - Added deployment row to summary table
   - Removed Vercel from "servers we haven't reviewed" (only Figma Dev Mode remains)
   - Updated review count to 18, rating distribution (3.5/5 cluster now has 6 servers)

3. **Build succeeded.** **Deploy blocked** — complying with Rob's directive to stop all SSH attempts.

### Site status
- **Committed, NOT deployed** (per Rob's directive — no SSH until cleared)
- 29 content pieces: 18 reviews + 2 guides + 9 comparisons
- Rating range: 2.5–4.5 across 18 reviews
- Only 1 server remains unreviewed: Figma Dev Mode

### What should happen next
- **Run 35:** Check inbox for Rob's SSH clearance. Write Figma Dev Mode MCP review (last unreviewed server).
- **Run 36+:** Deploy when Rob clears SSH. Execute promotion plan when accounts approved.
- **Future:** Favicon, newsletter setup, affiliate link integration

## Run 35 — 2026-03-14 — Content (Figma Dev Mode MCP Server Review — Final Unreviewed Server)

**Mode:** Researcher + Copywriter + Developer

### Inbox update
- No pending messages. No SSH clearance from Rob yet. Complying with deploy ban.

### What I did

1. **Wrote "The Figma Dev Mode MCP Server — Design-to-Code Translation Through Your AI Assistant"** — `content/reviews/figma-dev-mode-mcp-server.md`
   - **19th review**, last unreviewed server from our original list
   - Rating: **3.5/5** — unique write capabilities but crippling free tier
   - 12 tools (8 read, 4 write) covering code generation, design tokens, Code Connect, screenshots, FigJam, and code-to-canvas capture
   - Killer feature: `generate_figma_design` — captures live web pages and converts them to editable Figma frames. No community server can do this.
   - Code Connect maps Figma components to codebase components for improving code generation accuracy over time
   - Biggest issue: **6 tool calls/month** on free tier — most aggressive rate limiting of any MCP server we've reviewed. Paid Figma plan (Dev/Full seats) effectively required.
   - Prescriptive React+Tailwind output can conflict with existing codebases; nested components get flattened
   - Detailed comparison with community Framelink server (13,700 stars vs 403 for official): Framelink outputs descriptive JSON, preserves nesting, ~25% smaller payloads, no seat-type rate limits
   - OAuth remote-first architecture at `mcp.figma.com/mcp`

2. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added "Design-to-code" category row with Figma Dev Mode 3.5/5
   - Added full design-to-code section with Framelink comparison
   - Changed "What about servers we haven't reviewed?" to "All servers reviewed" — milestone reached
   - Updated review count to 19, rating distribution (3.5/5 cluster now has 7 servers)

3. **Build succeeded** (38ms). **Deploy blocked** — complying with Rob's directive to stop all SSH attempts.

### Site status
- **Committed, NOT deployed** (per Rob's directive — no SSH until cleared)
- 30 content pieces: 19 reviews + 2 guides + 9 comparisons
- Rating range: 2.5–4.5 across 19 reviews
- **All servers from original list now reviewed** — milestone reached
- 5 runs of content waiting to deploy

### What should happen next
- **Run 36:** Check inbox for Rob's SSH clearance. With all servers reviewed, pivot to new content types: deeper guides, workflow tutorials, or new server categories (AI/ML, cloud infrastructure, DevOps).
- **Run 37+:** Deploy when Rob clears SSH. Execute promotion plan when accounts approved.
- **Future:** Favicon, newsletter setup, affiliate link integration, new review targets
