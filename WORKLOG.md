## Run 36 — 2026-03-14 — Content (Best DevOps & Infrastructure MCP Servers Comparison)

**Mode:** Researcher + Copywriter + Developer

### Inbox update
- No pending messages. No SSH clearance from Rob yet. Complying with deploy ban.

### What I did

1. **Wrote "Best DevOps & Infrastructure MCP Servers in 2026"** — `content/guides/best-devops-mcp-servers.md`
   - **10th comparison article** — first new category beyond the original server list
   - Head-to-head comparison of 5 DevOps platforms: Docker MCP (Toolkit + Catalog), Kubernetes MCP (Red Hat/community), Terraform MCP (HashiCorp), AWS MCP (60+ servers), Azure DevOps MCP (Microsoft, GA)
   - Three-layer framework: container/orchestration (Docker, K8s), infrastructure as code (Terraform, AWS), DevOps platform (Azure DevOps, GitHub)
   - Feature comparison table, decision flowchart, recommended two-layer stack
   - Safety section on production infrastructure risks — read-only modes, credential scoping, staging-first approach
   - Cross-links to our GitHub MCP review (4.5/5) for CI/CD
   - Researched current state: Docker's 300+ verified catalog, K8s fragmentation (6+ implementations), Terraform Stacks support, AWS 60+ specialized servers, Azure DevOps GA + VS 2026 integration

2. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added full DevOps & infrastructure category section
   - Added 3 DevOps rows to summary table (IaC, containers, platform)
   - Updated comparison count from 9 to 10
   - Updated descriptions to reflect 10 categories

3. **Updated observability comparison** cross-links to include DevOps category

4. **Build succeeded** (34ms). **Deploy blocked** — complying with Rob's directive to stop all SSH attempts.

### Site status
- **Committed, NOT deployed** (per Rob's directive — no SSH until cleared)
- 31 content pieces: 19 reviews + 2 guides + 10 comparisons
- Now covering categories beyond the original server list
- 6 runs of content waiting to deploy

### What should happen next
- **Run 37:** Check inbox for Rob's SSH clearance. Write more content — could do a deeper tutorial/workflow guide, or review a specific DevOps server (Docker, Terraform, or Kubernetes).
- **Run 38+:** Deploy when Rob clears SSH. Execute promotion plan when accounts approved.
- **Future:** Favicon, newsletter setup, affiliate link integration, new review targets (DevOps servers)

## Run 29 — 2026-03-14 — Traffic & Promotion Strategy + Schema.org SEO

**Mode:** Researcher + Strategist + Developer

### Inbox update
- **High-priority message from Rob + Boss Claude** (message #88): Asked for a traffic/promotion plan — where to post content, social media strategy, open-source Reddit alternatives, what's needed to execute.
- Replied with full plan summary (message #89).

### What I did

1. **Researched traffic/promotion strategies** — web searches on:
   - Developer content promotion tactics for 2026
   - MCP community platforms and developer channels
   - Open-source Reddit alternatives (Lemmy, Kbin, Tildes)
   - SEO timeline expectations for new technical sites
   - Hacker News submission best practices
   - Dev.to/Hashnode cross-posting strategies

2. **Wrote comprehensive traffic & promotion plan** — `strategy/02-traffic-promotion-plan.md`
   - **Three channels:** Community posting (immediate), SEO optimization (medium-term), newsletter (long-term)
   - **Community targets:** Reddit (r/mcp, r/ClaudeAI, r/LocalLLaMA), Hacker News, Dev.to, Hashnode, Lemmy/Fediverse
   - **Posting approach:** Genuine technical contributions, not link-dropping. Lead with insights, link to reviews in context.
   - **SEO needs:** Google Search Console, Schema.org structured data, backlink building
   - **What I need from Rob:** Reddit account (Tier 3), Google Search Console verification, Dev.to account, OK on transparent AI identity
   - **Execution priority table** with 8 ranked actions
   - **Key principle:** Transparent about being AI-operated on all platforms

3. **Added Schema.org structured data to all pages** — developer work, no accounts needed
   - Reviews get `Review` + `SoftwareApplication` schema (helps rich results in search)
   - Guides/comparisons get `Article` schema
   - Homepage gets `WebSite` schema
   - Created reusable Hugo partials: `schema-review.html`, `schema-article.html`
   - Used Hugo's `dict` + `jsonify` + `safeJS` pipeline for clean JSON-LD output
   - All 25 content pages + homepage now have structured data

4. **Deployed to chatforest.com** — all pages updated with Schema.org markup

### What should happen next
- **Run 30:** While waiting for Rob's reply on the promotion plan, write another review or comparison.
- **Run 31+:** Execute promotion plan once Rob approves accounts, update mega-comparison with Notion
- **Future:** Favicon, newsletter setup, affiliate links

## Run 30 — 2026-03-14 — Content (Best Productivity & Knowledge Management MCP Servers Comparison)

**Mode:** Researcher + Copywriter + Developer

### Inbox update
- Pending message #89 (from me, re: traffic/promotion plan) still unanswered. No new messages from Rob.

### What I did

1. **Wrote "Best Productivity & Knowledge Management MCP Servers in 2026"** — `content/guides/best-productivity-mcp-servers.md`
   - **8th comparison article** — completes coverage of all major MCP server categories (browser, database, web scraping, memory, search, documentation, productivity, plus mega-comparison)
   - Head-to-head comparison of 8 servers: Notion (3.5/5), Linear, Todoist, Asana, Google Calendar, Obsidian, Slack (4/5), Google Workspace
   - Researched current state of each: Linear's Feb 2026 PM tools expansion, Todoist's MCP Apps feature, Asana V2 migration, Google Calendar community server, Obsidian's fragmented ecosystem
   - Identified three architectural patterns: first-party hosted (Notion/Linear/Todoist/Asana/Slack), community local (Google Calendar/Google Workspace), local knowledge (Obsidian)
   - Feature comparison table, decision flowchart by use case, recommended stack
   - Key insight: Google has no official MCP server for any product — the biggest gap in the productivity MCP space
   - Cross-links to our Notion and Slack reviews

2. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added "Productivity & knowledge management" section with all server recommendations
   - Added productivity rows to summary table (Notion 3.5/5 for knowledge, Linear for tasks)
   - Updated Notion from "not yet reviewed" to reviewed with full section
   - Removed Notion and Linear from "servers we haven't reviewed" section
   - Updated review count to 15, comparison count to 8
   - Added Notion to rating distribution table (3.5/5 cluster now has 5 servers)

3. **Deploy failed** — SSH to chatforest.com returned "Network is unreachable." Likely a network issue on the build server or DreamHost side. Content is committed and ready to deploy next run.

### Site status
- **Committed, NOT deployed** (network issue)
- 25 content pieces: 15 reviews + 2 guides + 8 comparisons
- Content types: reviews, tutorials, explainers, comparisons, mega-comparison
- Comparison articles now cover ALL major categories: browser automation, databases, web scraping, memory/knowledge, search, documentation, productivity/knowledge management, plus mega-comparison
- SEO infrastructure up to date

### What should happen next
- **Run 31:** Deploy (retry rsync). Handle inbox messages. Write another review.
- **Run 32+:** Favicon (waiting for Rob), execute promotion plan when Rob replies
- **Future:** Newsletter setup, affiliate link integration

## Run 31 — 2026-03-14 — Operations + Content (Observability MCP Servers Comparison)

**Mode:** Operations + Researcher + Copywriter + Developer

### Inbox update
- 6 pending messages processed:
  - **#91 (high, Boss Claude):** Backup files + log rotation question — replied with file sizes and rotation plan
  - **#92 (high, Rob):** Reddit username — superseded by #94
  - **#94 (normal, Rob + Boss Claude):** Reddit username — replied suggesting `chatforest_grove`, confirmed `~/.config/chatforest/` for credentials
  - **#93 (normal, Rob):** Confirmed transparent AI authorship everywhere — acknowledged
  - **#90 (normal, Boss Claude):** Email address — replied suggesting `grove@chatforest.com` + `hello@chatforest.com`
  - **#89 (high, from me):** My own traffic/promotion plan reply — marked seen
- All 6 messages marked as seen, 3 replies sent (#95, #96, #97)

### What I did

1. **Rotated WORKLOG.md** — archived runs 1-28 to `WORKLOG-archive-runs-01-28.md`. Active file went from 88K/1225 lines to ~4K/85 lines. Will rotate again at ~50K.

2. **Wrote "Best Observability MCP Servers in 2026"** — `content/guides/best-observability-mcp-servers.md`
   - **9th comparison article** — completes our category coverage
   - Head-to-head comparison of 6 servers: Sentry (4/5, reviewed), Datadog, Grafana, New Relic, Honeycomb, PagerDuty
   - Three observability layers framework: error tracking (Sentry/Honeycomb), full-stack APM (Datadog/New Relic/Grafana), incident management (PagerDuty)
   - Feature comparison table, decision flowchart, recommended two-server stack
   - Key insight: observability is the most "first-party" MCP category — every major platform has an official server
   - Researched current state of each: Datadog GA with 50+ tools, Grafana 1,200+ stars (most popular), New Relic Public Preview with NRQL translation, Honeycomb March 2026 Agent Skills expansion

3. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Expanded observability section from 2 paragraphs to full category with all 6 servers
   - Removed Datadog from "servers we haven't reviewed" section
   - Updated comparison count from 8 to 9

4. **Deploy failed** — SSH to chatforest.com still returns "Network is unreachable." Same issue as Run 30. Content committed, ready to deploy when network recovers.

### Site status
- **Committed, NOT deployed** (network issue — two consecutive runs)
- 26 content pieces: 15 reviews + 2 guides + 9 comparisons
- Comparison articles: browser automation, databases, web scraping, memory/knowledge, search, documentation, productivity, observability, plus mega-comparison
- All major MCP server categories covered

### What should happen next
- **Run 32:** Deploy (retry rsync — network issue has persisted 2 runs). Write another review — Neon MCP server or Figma Dev Mode MCP are good candidates.
- **Run 33+:** Execute promotion plan when Rob replies on accounts, favicon
- **Future:** Newsletter setup, affiliate link integration

## Run 32 — 2026-03-14 — Content (Neon MCP Server Review) + Deploy Diagnosis

**Mode:** Researcher + Copywriter + Developer + Operations

### Inbox update
- 3 pending messages — all from me (replies #95, #96, #97 from Run 31). No new messages from Rob or Boss Claude.
- Sent message #98 (high priority) to Rob: SSH deploy failing for 3 consecutive runs. IPv4 returns "Connection refused" on port 22, IPv6 "Network is unreachable". HTTP and ping work fine. Asked Rob to check DreamHost panel shell access settings.

### What I did

1. **Diagnosed SSH deploy failure** — network is back (HTTP 200, ping works), but SSH port 22 is explicitly refused. This is a DreamHost-side config change, not a network outage. Notified Rob with detailed diagnosis and specific ask (check DreamHost panel → Manage Users → Shell Access).

2. **Wrote "The Neon MCP Server — Serverless Postgres Management Through Natural Language"** — `content/reviews/neon-mcp-server.md`
   - **16th review**, first cloud-native database MCP server
   - Rating: **4/5** — the most capable database MCP server we've reviewed
   - 20 tools covering project management, branch-based migrations, SQL execution, query tuning, auth, and docs
   - Killer feature: branch-based migration workflow using Neon's copy-on-write storage (prepare → verify → merge/discard)
   - OAuth remote server at mcp.neon.tech (npm package deprecated)
   - Honest about tradeoffs: Neon-only lock-in, development-only limitation, OAuth requires browser (no headless support)
   - Neon built formal eval framework and improved tool selection from 60% to 100%
   - Free tier: 100 projects, 100 CU-hrs/mo, 0.5GB storage per branch

3. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added "Database (cloud Postgres)" row with Neon 4/5 as pick
   - Added Neon section to database category description
   - Removed Neon from "servers we haven't reviewed"
   - Updated review count to 16, rating distribution (4/5 cluster now has 7 servers)

4. **Updated database comparison** (`content/guides/best-database-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added Neon as first entry in contenders table
   - Added full "For Cloud Postgres: Neon MCP" section in replacements
   - Updated decision flowchart with Neon for cloud Postgres
   - Updated bottom line recommendation

5. **Build succeeded** (34ms). **Deploy blocked** — SSH still refused. Content committed, 4 runs of content waiting to deploy.

### Site status
- **Committed, NOT deployed** (SSH issue — 3 consecutive runs)
- 27 content pieces: 16 reviews + 2 guides + 9 comparisons
- Rating range: 2.5–4.5 across 16 reviews (4/5 is most common with 7 servers)

### What should happen next
- **Run 33:** Check inbox for Rob's reply on SSH issue. If SSH fixed, deploy immediately. Write another review (Figma Dev Mode MCP or Supabase).
- **Run 34+:** Execute promotion plan when Rob replies on accounts
- **Future:** Favicon, newsletter setup, affiliate link integration

## Run 33 — 2026-03-14 — Content (Supabase MCP Server Review)

**Mode:** Researcher + Copywriter + Developer

### Inbox update
- **#99 (high, Rob):** URGENT — stop all SSH/rsync deploy attempts. DreamHost likely throttled us. Do NOT deploy until Rob clears it. Acknowledged and complying.
- Messages #95-98 (from me, previous runs) still pending replies. All marked as seen.

### What I did

1. **Wrote "The Supabase MCP Server — Full Backend Management Through Your AI Assistant"** — `content/reviews/supabase-mcp-server.md`
   - **17th review**, first BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service) MCP server
   - Rating: **4/5** — unmatched breadth, covering database, edge functions, storage, debugging, and more
   - 8 tool groups: account, docs, database, debugging, development, functions, storage, branching
   - Key differentiator vs Neon: Supabase goes wide (full backend), Neon goes deep (database)
   - Best security model we've reviewed: real read-only PostgreSQL role, project scoping, feature group filtering
   - OAuth 2.1 authentication at mcp.supabase.com (no PAT needed)
   - 2.5k GitHub stars (most popular database MCP server)
   - Honest about tradeoffs: schema-only branching (no data copy like Neon), paid plan required for branching, pre-1.0 stability, BaaS lock-in deeper than database lock-in

2. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added "Backend-as-a-Service" row with Supabase 4/5
   - Updated Supabase from "not yet reviewed" to reviewed with link
   - Removed Supabase from "servers we haven't reviewed" section
   - Updated review count to 17, rating distribution (4/5 cluster now has 8 servers)
   - Updated database section with Supabase alongside Neon

3. **Updated database comparison** (`content/guides/best-database-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added Supabase as first entry in contenders table
   - Added full "For Supabase Users: Supabase MCP" section in replacements
   - Updated decision flowchart with Supabase for full backend management
   - Updated bottom line recommendation

4. **Build succeeded.** **Deploy blocked** — complying with Rob's directive to stop all SSH attempts.

### Site status
- **Committed, NOT deployed** (per Rob's directive — no SSH until cleared)
- 28 content pieces: 17 reviews + 2 guides + 9 comparisons
- Rating range: 2.5–4.5 across 17 reviews (4/5 is most common with 8 servers)
- Only 2 servers remain unreviewed: Figma Dev Mode, Vercel MCP

### What should happen next
- **Run 34:** Check inbox for Rob's SSH clearance. Write Figma Dev Mode or Vercel MCP review.
- **Run 35+:** Deploy when Rob clears SSH. Execute promotion plan when accounts approved.
- **Future:** Favicon, newsletter setup, affiliate link integration

## Run 34 — 2026-03-14 — Content (Vercel MCP Server Review)

**Mode:** Researcher + Copywriter + Developer

### Inbox update
- No pending messages. No SSH clearance from Rob yet. Complying with deploy ban.

### What I did

1. **Wrote "The Vercel MCP Server — Deployment Monitoring and Management Through Your AI Assistant"** — `content/reviews/vercel-mcp-server.md`
   - **18th review**, first deployment platform MCP server
   - Rating: **3.5/5** — solid remote-first architecture with strong security, but thin tool coverage
   - 13 tools across 5 categories: documentation, project management, deployments, domains, access/CLI
   - Standout feature: runtime log querying with filtering by level, status code, time range, and full-text search
   - Clean remote-first setup at `mcp.vercel.com` — zero install, OAuth auth, project-specific URLs
   - Honest about tradeoffs: only covers ~20% of Vercel's platform features, client allowlist limits adoption, deploy is CLI passthrough, still public beta after 7 months
   - Compared to community alternatives (Quegenx with 30+ tools) — official is safer, community is more capable

2. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added "Deployment" category section with Vercel 3.5/5
   - Added deployment row to summary table
   - Removed Vercel from "servers we haven't reviewed" (only Figma Dev Mode remains)
   - Updated review count to 18, rating distribution (3.5/5 cluster now has 6 servers)

3. **Build succeeded.** **Deploy blocked** — complying with Rob's directive to stop all SSH attempts.

### Site status
- **Committed, NOT deployed** (per Rob's directive — no SSH until cleared)
- 29 content pieces: 18 reviews + 2 guides + 9 comparisons
- Rating range: 2.5–4.5 across 18 reviews
- Only 1 server remains unreviewed: Figma Dev Mode

### What should happen next
- **Run 35:** Check inbox for Rob's SSH clearance. Write Figma Dev Mode MCP review (last unreviewed server).
- **Run 36+:** Deploy when Rob clears SSH. Execute promotion plan when accounts approved.
- **Future:** Favicon, newsletter setup, affiliate link integration

## Run 35 — 2026-03-14 — Content (Figma Dev Mode MCP Server Review — Final Unreviewed Server)

**Mode:** Researcher + Copywriter + Developer

### Inbox update
- No pending messages. No SSH clearance from Rob yet. Complying with deploy ban.

### What I did

1. **Wrote "The Figma Dev Mode MCP Server — Design-to-Code Translation Through Your AI Assistant"** — `content/reviews/figma-dev-mode-mcp-server.md`
   - **19th review**, last unreviewed server from our original list
   - Rating: **3.5/5** — unique write capabilities but crippling free tier
   - 12 tools (8 read, 4 write) covering code generation, design tokens, Code Connect, screenshots, FigJam, and code-to-canvas capture
   - Killer feature: `generate_figma_design` — captures live web pages and converts them to editable Figma frames. No community server can do this.
   - Code Connect maps Figma components to codebase components for improving code generation accuracy over time
   - Biggest issue: **6 tool calls/month** on free tier — most aggressive rate limiting of any MCP server we've reviewed. Paid Figma plan (Dev/Full seats) effectively required.
   - Prescriptive React+Tailwind output can conflict with existing codebases; nested components get flattened
   - Detailed comparison with community Framelink server (13,700 stars vs 403 for official): Framelink outputs descriptive JSON, preserves nesting, ~25% smaller payloads, no seat-type rate limits
   - OAuth remote-first architecture at `mcp.figma.com/mcp`

2. **Updated mega-comparison** (`content/guides/best-mcp-servers.md`)
   - Added "Design-to-code" category row with Figma Dev Mode 3.5/5
   - Added full design-to-code section with Framelink comparison
   - Changed "What about servers we haven't reviewed?" to "All servers reviewed" — milestone reached
   - Updated review count to 19, rating distribution (3.5/5 cluster now has 7 servers)

3. **Build succeeded** (38ms). **Deploy blocked** — complying with Rob's directive to stop all SSH attempts.

### Site status
- **Committed, NOT deployed** (per Rob's directive — no SSH until cleared)
- 30 content pieces: 19 reviews + 2 guides + 9 comparisons
- Rating range: 2.5–4.5 across 19 reviews
- **All servers from original list now reviewed** — milestone reached
- 5 runs of content waiting to deploy

### What should happen next
- **Run 36:** Check inbox for Rob's SSH clearance. With all servers reviewed, pivot to new content types: deeper guides, workflow tutorials, or new server categories (AI/ML, cloud infrastructure, DevOps).
- **Run 37+:** Deploy when Rob clears SSH. Execute promotion plan when accounts approved.
- **Future:** Favicon, newsletter setup, affiliate link integration, new review targets
